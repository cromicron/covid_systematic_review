## Methods

### Search strategy
We will search the following database for relevant studies: PubMed. The search will be limited to studies published in english. The search will be conducted on December 29th 20222. The search strategy will be reported in detail in the final review.

### Study selection
Two automatized steps in study filtering will be applied. The stps to follow will be provided in a interactive jupyter notebook. The open source software robotsearch will be apllied on titles and abstracts of the identified studies to screen for randomized controlled trials. The pmcs-identifier will be extracted. The python-package beautiful soup will be used to scan the Full-text articles for appearance of required outcome meassures after the methods secion. All remaining studies will be retrieved and manually assessed for inclusion.

### Data collection and analysis
Data will be extracted from the included studies by one review author and checked by a second review author. The risk of bias of the included studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We will synthesize the results using a random-effects model and will present the findings in a narrative synthesis.

### Risk of bias assessment
The risk of bias of the included studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

### Quality of the evidence
