We follow the following protocol. Open the file papers_html.txt. Apply to protocol to each study individually. Open the file screening_results.csv in a csv-editor of your choice to record your results. Type 1 into the cell if criterion is met and 0 if it is not met. Stop checking the other criteria once you coded one as 0 and continue to the next. Note that initially when this protocol was created, studies had to include a placebo-group. This turned out to too strict a criterion, because only two studies fulfilled all criteria. Therefore we decided to include open-label studies.\n",
