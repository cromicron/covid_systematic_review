We follow the following protocol. Open each of the htmls above by clicking on the link or open the file papers_html.txt. Apply the protocol below to each study individually. Open the file screening_results.csv in a csv-editor of your choice to record your results. Note that the separator is semicolon. Type 1 into the cell if criterion is met and 0 if it is not met. Stop checking the other criteria once you coded one criterion as 0 and continue to the next. Note that initially when this protocol was created, studies had to include a placebo-group. This turned out to too strict a criterion, because only few studies fulfilled all criteria. Therefore we decided to include open-label studies.\n",

Check the abstract and methods secion to check if the papers are randomized control trials. Don't include studies, in which both experimental and control group involves Remdesivir but different dossage. Keywords indicating that a study is not an RCT are: \"retrospective\" study or analysis or observational cohort study. Note that randomizatin between remdesivir and control must take place. There are studies, in which participants are randomized between two different dosages of remdesivir.\n",

    "### Remdesivir only \n",
    "The only difference between treatment- and control-group should be whether patients received remdesivir or not. Control groups can be placebo or standard-care. If multiple treatments are tested, the study must include a comparison of remdesivir with a placebo or standard care group. If both groups receive remdesivir, but in different dosages you should exclude the study. If there are multiple treatments tested in the same study, there must be a propper comparison of remdesivir and a control-group.\n",
    "### Propper outcome\n",
    "To assess the effectiveness of treatment with Remdesivir compared to the placebo or standard-care, there must be a propper effect-meassure reported. \n",
    "Check if at least one of the outcomes \"time to recovery\" or \"time to clinical improvement\" or equivalent meassures has one of these meassures associated with it: odds-ratio, hazard-ratio, rate-ratio. Keep in mind that what the authors declare as primary outcome might not be the primary outcome for this study. You might even have to look into the appendices to retrieve it.\n",
    "### Propper outcome\n",
    "To assess the effectiveness of treatment with Remdesivir compared to the placebo or standard-care, there must be a propper effect-meassure reported.
