# Systematic Review and Meta Analysis of Remdesivir for COVID-19 Treatment

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a systematic review and meta analysis of the effectiveness of the drug Remdesivir in treating COVID-19. The goal of this project is to provide a clear and reproducible protocol for conducting a systematic review and meta analysis, as well as to produce a meta analysis of the findings of the included studies.

## Project Components

This project consists of three main components:

1. Protocol development: A detailed protocol for conducting a systematic review and meta analysis is provided, including the selection criteria for included studies and the methods for data extraction and analysis.

2. Systematic review: The protocol is followed to conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of Remdesivir in treating COVID-19. The review includes a description of the search strategy, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the characteristics of the included studies.

3. Meta analysis: A meta analysis of the findings of the included studies is conducted using appropriate statistical methods. The results of the meta analysis are presented in a clear and concise manner, including a summary of the main findings and any limitations of the analysis.

## Requirements and Dependencies

This project requires the following software and libraries:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version 3.6 or higher)
- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) (optional, but recommended)
- [metafor](https://cran.r-project.org/package=metafor) package for R
- [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package for R

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Directory containing the data files for the systematic review and meta analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing the Jupyter notebooks for the protocol development, systematic review, and meta analysis.
- `output/`: Directory containing the output files (e.g. PDFs, HTML files) generated from the Jupyter notebooks.
- `README.md`: This file, containing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Running the Code

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required software and libraries as listed in the "Requirements and Dependencies" section above.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory and run the code cells to reproduce the results of the protocol development, systematic review, and meta analysis.
