TI  - Protocol Deviations before and after Treatment with Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator in Community Hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protocol deviations before and after tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment for ischemic stroke are common. It is unclear if patient or hospital factors predict protocol deviations. We examined predictors of protocol deviations and the effects of protocol violations on symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH).
AB  - METHODS: We used data from the Increasing Stroke Treatment through Interventional Behavior Change Tactics trial, a cluster-randomized, controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a barrier assessment and educational intervention to increase appropriate tPA use in 24 Michigan community hospitals, to review tPA treatments between 2007 and 2010. Protocol violations were defined as deviations from the standard tPA protocol, both before and after treatment. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to determine if patient and hospital variables were associated with pretreatment or post-treatment protocol deviations.
AB  - RESULTS: During the study, 557 patients (mean age 70, 52% male, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 12) were treated with tPA. Protocol deviations occurred in 233 (42%) patients: 16% had pretreatment deviations, 35% had post-treatment deviations, and 9% had both. The most common protocol deviations included elevated post-treatment blood pressure, antithrombotic agent use within 24 hours of treatment, and elevated pretreatment blood pressure. Protocol deviations were not associated with sICH, stroke severity, or hospital factors. Older age was associated with pretreatment protocol deviations (adjusted odds ratio [OR], .52; 95% confidence interval [CI], .30-.92). Pretreatment deviations were associated with post-treatment deviations (adjusted OR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.91-5.35).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Protocol deviations were not associated with sICH. Aside from age, patient and hospital factors were not associated with protocol deviations.Copyright © 2015 National Stroke Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Depression, patient characteristics, and attachment style: correlates and mediators of medication treatment adherence in a racially diverse primary care sample.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The depth and breadth of problems related to depressive symptomatology and optimal treatment outcomes, including medication treatment adherence, have long been documented in the literature. Missing are clear explanations as to what factors and patient characteristics may account for lack of medication treatment adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The two objectives of the current study were to examine the predictive strength of depression, patient characteristics, and patient attachment style regarding medication treatment adherence and to consider the extent to which attachment styles mediate the relation between depression and medication treatment adherence.
AB  - METHOD: Participants in the present study were 237 racially diverse American primary care patients with a diagnosis of hypertension who were participants in a clinical trial. Depression, patient characteristics, attachment style, and medication treatment adherence were assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: Partly consistent with our four hypotheses, the following results were found: (a) Black American, younger, never married, and poorer patients had lower medication treatment adherence (b) depression was significantly associated with lower self-reported medication adherence; (c) insecure-dismissing attachment style was related to lower medication adherence; and (d) insecure-dismissing attachment style mediates the relation between depression and medication treatment adherence by exacerbating the negative association.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Physicians and other primary care providers should consider how depressive symptomatology, patient characteristics, and attachment style may inform the treatment plans they put forward and the extent to which patients may adhere to those treatment plans.

TI  - Improved Blood Pressure Control Using an Interactive Mobile Phone Support System.
AB  - This explorative, longitudinal study evaluated the effect of the daily use of a mobile phone-based self-management support system for hypertension in reducing blood pressure (BP) among 50 primary care patients with hypertension over 8 weeks. The self-management system comprises modules for (1) self-reports of BP, pulse, lifestyle, symptoms, and well-being; (2) delivery of reminders and encouragements; and (3) graphical feedback of self-reports. Daily use of the support system significantly reduced BP (systolic BP -7 mm Hg, diastolic BP -4.9 mm Hg) between baseline and week 8, with daily improvements leveling off as the study progressed. Three homogenous subsets of patients were identified who, despite different initial BP levels, showed similar decreases in BP during the study, indicating that patients benefited irrespective of baseline BP. In showing significant reductions in BP, our results suggest that the self-management support system may be a useful tool in clinical practice to help patients self-manage their hypertension.

TI  - Management of Hypertensive Patients With Multiple Drug Intolerances: A Single-Center Experience of a Novel Treatment Algorithm.
AB  - Multiple drug intolerance to antihypertensive medications (MDI-HTN) is an overlooked cause of nonadherence. In this study, 55 patients with MDI-HTN were managed with a novel treatment algorithm utilizing sequentially initiated monotherapies or combinations of maximally tolerated doses of fractional tablet doses, liquid formulations, transdermal preparations, and off-label tablet medications. A total of 10% of referred patients had MDI-HTN, resulting in insufficient pharmacotherapy and baseline office blood pressure (OBP) of 178+/-24/94+/-15 mm Hg. At baseline, patients were intolerant to 7.6+/-3.6 antihypertensives; they were receiving 1.4+/-1.1 medications. After 6 months on the novel MDI-HTN treatment algorithm, both OBP and home blood pressure (HBP) were significantly reduced, with patients receiving 2.0+/-1.2 medications. At 12 months, OBP was reduced from baseline by 17+/-5/9+/-3 mm Hg (P<.01, P<.05) and HBP was reduced by 11+/-5/12+/-3 mm Hg (P<.01 for both) while patients were receiving 1.9+/-1.1 medications. Application of a stratified medicine approach allowed patients to tolerate increased numbers of medications and achieved significant long-term lowering of blood pressure.

TI  - Risks associated with permanent discontinuation of blood pressure-lowering medications in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The associations of discontinuation of the study medication on major outcomes were assessed in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation Trial.
AB  - METHODS: ADVANCE was a factorial randomized controlled trial of blood pressure lowering (a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide vs. placebo) and intensive glucose control (vs. standard glucose control) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients who permanently discontinued the randomized blood pressure-lowering medication during the study period (n = 1557) were compared with others (n = 9583). Cox's proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effects of the discontinuation on the risks of macrovascular events, microvascular events together and separately and all-cause mortality, using discontinuation as a time-dependent covariate.
AB  - RESULTS: In multivariable analyses, discontinuation was associated with increased risks of combined macro and microvascular events (hazard ratio 2.24, 95% CI 1.96-2.57), macrovascular events (3.23, 2.75-3.79), microvascular events (1.38, 1.11-1.71), and all-cause mortality (7.99, 6.92-9.21) compared to continuing administration of randomized medications during the trial period, which were highest in the first year after discontinuation. These associations were similar in active and placebo groups, except in the first year after discontinuation during which event rates were lower in the active group than in the placebo group (P < 0.01).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Discontinuation of study medication is a potent risk marker for identifying high-risk patients. Thus it is important that clinicians seek to identify such patients early after discontinuation of treatment. Although some short-term residual effects of previous active treatment can be expected, patients who discontinue require further urgent investigation and management.

TI  - Process- and patient-reported outcomes of a multifaceted medication adherence intervention for hypertensive patients in secondary care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to antihypertensive medications is suboptimal. Hospital pharmacist interventions including motivational interviewing (MI) might assist in improving adherence in patients with hypertension. For an intervention to be useful, it is important to have tools that can easily identify potential adherence problems.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate process outcomes and patient- and pharmacist-reported outcomes of a pharmacist adherence intervention for hypertensive patients treated in hospital outpatient clinics. Secondly, to determine the agreement between two different adherence metrics: an adherence questionnaire used in the intervention and a prescription-based measure.
AB  - METHODS: The development of the intervention was based on adherence and behavioral theories and evidence of effective interventions. This included a focused medication review, a patient interview, and follow-up telephone calls. Two tools were used to identify adherence problems: The Drug Adherence Work-up (DRAW) tool and an adherence questionnaire. Process data included drug-related problems (DRPs) with recommendations to the physicians, medication- and lifestyle problems identified at the patient interview, actions taken and time spent on the intervention.
AB  - RESULTS: In total, 91 DRPs in 8 categories generated recommendations to the physicians; 56 recommendations were generated at the medication review and 35 at the patient interview. At the interview, 421 problems were identified, of which 60% were medication-related and 40% lifestyle-related. In connection with the interview, 528 actions were taken within 8 different categories. MI was a central technique applicable for most problems and was employed in nearly all patients (94%). About half of the patients reported increased focus on lifestyle change, and 21-39% reported increased knowledge, confidence and skills in relation to their medication as well as better quality of life. The pharmacists found that the intervention elements were meaningful pharmacist tasks, and that the DRAW tool was easy to use and helped them focus on addressing reasons for non-adherence. The mean total time spent by the pharmacist per patient was 2 h 14 min (SD 40 min).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacist-led, multifaceted, tailored adherence intervention was feasible for identifying and addressing a wide range of potential adherence and lifestyle problems. Among the intervention procedures, MI was a central technique, applicable in most types of problems. The questionnaire showed relatively little value for identifying non-adherence. The intervention was well accepted both by the pharmacists and the patients, thereby increasing the likeliness of successful implementation in routine practice.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Quantifying the 3 Biases That Lead to Unintentional Overestimation of the Blood Pressure-Lowering Effect of Renal Denervation. [Review]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of renal denervation report disparate results. Meta-analysis by trial design may allow quantitative estimation of sources and magnitude of biases in denervation studies.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred forty nonrandomized, 6 randomized open-label, and 2 randomized blinded studies were analyzed for 2 outcomes: (1) blood pressure changes for nonrandomized, open-label randomized, and blinded studies; and (2) quantification of 3 biases potentially contributing to apparent antihypertensive effects: (a) regression to the mean, (b) asymmetrical data handling, and (c) true blood pressure drops caused by something other than the tested therapy (confounding). Nonrandomized studies and open-label randomized trials reported large reductions in office blood pressure of 23.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.0 to 25.3) and 29.1 mm Hg (95% CI, 25.2 to 33.1 mm Hg), respectively. They reported smaller reductions in ambulatory blood pressures (11.2 mm Hg; 95% CI, 10.0 to 12.4). The blinded trials found no significant reduction in blood pressure (2.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -0.4 to 6.3). Analyses of these data indicate the magnitude of the 3 potential sources of bias to be regression to the mean, -1.01 mm Hg (95% CI, 4.24 to -6.27); asymmetrical data handling, -10.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -8.77 to -12.87); and confounding, -8.3 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.73 to -11.83).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Increasingly bias-resistant trial designs report effect sizes of decreasing magnitude. This disparity may be caused by asymmetrical data handling and confounding (eg, increased drug adherence). If these differences are caused by trial design and not by some other differences in patients or procedures, which happen to match the trial design, then randomization alone is not enough: blinding is also needed. This has broad implications across trials of medications and devices.Copyright © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.

TI  - Supporting the self-management of hypertension: Patients' experiences of using a mobile phone-based system.
AB  - Globally, hypertension is poorly controlled and its treatment consists mainly of preventive behavior, adherence to treatment and risk-factor management. The aim of this study was to explore patients' experiences of an interactive mobile phone-based system designed to support the self-management of hypertension. Forty-nine patients were interviewed about their experiences of using the self-management system for 8 weeks regarding: (i) daily answers on self-report questions concerning lifestyle, well-being, symptoms, medication intake and side effects; (ii) results of home blood-pressure measurements; (iii) reminders and motivational messages; and (iv) access to a web-based platform for visualization of the self-reports. The audio-recorded interviews were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. The patients considered the self-management system relevant for the follow-up of hypertension and found it easy to use, but some provided insight into issues for improvement. They felt that using the system offered benefits, for example, increasing their participation during follow-up consultations; they further perceived that it helped them gain understanding of the interplay between blood pressure and daily life, which resulted in increased motivation to follow treatment. Increased awareness of the importance of adhering to prescribed treatment may be a way to minimize the cardiovascular risks of hypertension.

TI  - Outcomes of a Seven Practice Pilot in a Pay-For-Performance (P4P)-Based Program in Pennsylvania.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine how targeted six-month interventions impacted Best Practice/Patient Outcomes for minority patients receiving primary care in physician practices participating in a pay-for-performance (P4P) program.
AB  - METHODS: P4P Practices were invited to participate in a pilot intervention study designed to improve care for minority patients with hypertension, diabetes or pediatric asthma. Patient medical records were reviewed to assess how the interventions impacted (n=7 practices): Body mass index, diet and exercise, smoking, compliance with visits as recommended, blood pressure, sodium intake and weight management counseling, medication reconciliation, HbA1c testing, annual lipid profile, and anti-inflammatory medications.
AB  - RESULTS: Significant improvements in various clinical quality measures were observed in all seven practices. Of the 19 specified interventions, 13 were statistically significant at alpha=0.05 level and 14 met the target proportion. This suggests that the best practice intervention had a significant impact on some of the health care processes in the physician practices.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The most impactful interventions were those related to face-to-face educational discussions, patient medical chart documentations rather than those pertaining to medication adherence. Improvements in measuring reporting and recording of data at post-intervention were also observed.

TI  - Medication-taking behavior in hypertensive patients with a single-tablet, fixed-dose combination in Japan.
AB  - Non-persistence rate (defined as not remaining on treatment) in patients taking a renin angiotensin system inhibitor plus calcium channel blocker was studied in three integrated 12-weeks surveys by matching separate drug combination therapy (CT) and fixed-dose combination (FDC). We also investigated medication adherence measured by proportion of days covered by using a claims database. The non-persistence rate was significantly lower in FDC than CT (p=0.0074). In the database study, the medication adherence was higher in FDC than CT for 3, 6, and 12 months (all p<0.001). In conclusion, use of single-tablet FDC antihypertensive therapy was associated with better medication-taking behavior.

TI  - Comparative study of the efficacy of olmesartan/amlodipine vs. perindopril/amlodipine in peripheral blood pressure after missed dose in type 2 diabetes.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Combination therapy is needed to control blood pressure (BP) in a large number of hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus. Adherence to treatment is a major clinical problem; therefore, the time duration of the antihypertensive action of a drug determines BP control when a dose is skipped.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to determine whether the fixed-dose combination of olmesartan/amlodipine provides equal efficacy and safety as the perindopril/amlodipine combination when a drug dose is missed.
AB  - METHODS: In this noninferiority trial with a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy parallel group, controlled design, 260 patients received either olmesartan 20-40 mg/amlodipine 5-10 mg or perindopril 4-8 mg/amlodipine 5-10 mg for 24 weeks. The main outcome was the sitting office DBP after 24 weeks of treatment at 48 h from last administration.
AB  - RESULTS: The olmesartan/amlodipine combination reached noninferiority criteria in reduction of office DBP after 24 weeks of treatment and after the missed dose, compared with the perindopril/amlodipine combination (-11.7 and -10.5 mmHg, respectively). Office SBP and pulse pressure were significantly lower in both groups after 24 weeks of treatment and 48 h after the missed dose, observing a trend to greater SBP reduction in the olmesartan/amlodipine group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The combination olmesartan/amlodipine is safe, well tolerated, and as effective as the combination of perindopril/amlodipine in the control of essential hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus. A missed dose does not leave the patients unprotected in both treatments; however, a faster control with less dose increment is observed with olmesartan/amlodipine.

TI  - Brief provider communication skills training fails to impact patient hypertension outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypertension remains a prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and improved medication adherence leads to better blood pressure (BP) control. We sought to improve medication adherence and hypertension outcomes among patients with uncontrolled BP through communication skills training targeting providers.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a communication skills intervention for primary care doctors compared to usual care controls, on the outcomes of BP (systolic, diastolic), patient self-reported medication adherence, and provider counseling, assessed at baseline and post-intervention. We enrolled 379 patients with uncontrolled BP; 203 (54%) with follow-up data comprised our final sample. We performed random effects least squares regression analyses to examine whether the provider training improved outcomes, using clinics as the unit of randomization.
AB  - RESULTS: In neither unadjusted nor multivariate analyses were significant differences in change detected from baseline to follow-up in provider counseling, medication adherence or BP, for the intervention versus control groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention did not improve the outcomes; it may have been too brief and lacked sufficient practice level changes to impact counseling, adherence or BP.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future intervention efforts may require more extensive provider training, along with broader systematic changes, to improve patient outcomes.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effectiveness of a multidisciplinary intervention to improve hypertension control in an urban underserved practice.
AB  - Patient-centered, multidisciplinary interventions offer one of the most promising strategies to improve blood pressure (BP) control, yet effectiveness trials in underserved real-world settings are limited. We used a multidisciplinary strategy to improve hypertension control in an underserved urban practice. We collected 1007 surveys to monitor medication adherence and used weighted generalized estimating equations to examine trends in BP control. We examined 13,404 visits from patients with hypertension between August 2010 and February 2014. Overall, BP control rates increased from 51.0% to 67.4% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-1.74) by the end of the intervention phase and were maintained during the postintervention phase (adjusted odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.41-1.82). Medication adherence scores increased across the intervention (5.9-6.6; P < .001), but were not sustained at the conclusion of the study (5.9-6.2; P = .16). A multidisciplinary team approach involving registered nurses, pharmacists, and physicians resulted in substantial improvements in hypertension control in a real-world underserved setting.Copyright © 2015 American Society of Hypertension.

TI  - Patterns of treatment modifications among newly treated hypertensive patients: does choice of modification strategy affect likelihood of treatment discontinuation?.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Treatment modifications--addition, uptitration, switching, and downtitration--are necessary to address issues such as unattained blood pressure goals, adverse drug events, drug cost, or patient dissatisfaction which lead to treatment discontinuation. This study assessed the patterns of treatment modifications, and compared the rates of treatment modification and time-to-treatment modification across five antihypertensive drug classes (ADCs). Additionally, the association between treatment modification strategies and the likelihood of treatment discontinuation was assessed.
AB  - METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study using the BlueCross-BlueShield of Texas commercial claims database (2008-2012). Treatment modifications that occurred within 1 year of starting hypertension treatment were identified. Patients who received treatment modifications were followed for 12 months to determine if and when they discontinued treatment. Cox regression models were used to determine the likelihood of treatment modification and treatment discontinuation.
AB  - RESULTS: About 48.5% of patients received treatment modifications within 1 year of treatment initiation. Rates of treatment modification were significantly different across ADCs; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker users were less likely to receive treatment modifications compared with other ADCs. Mean time-to-treatment modification was more than 100 days for adding and uptitrating, and more than 140 days for switching and downtitrating. Patients intensifying treatment by adding medications were about 25% (vs. uptitration) and 50% (vs. switching) less likely to discontinue treatment.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Treatment modifications are common among newly treated hypertensive patients, and the rates vary significantly across ADCs. In the real world, treatment modifications occur much later than the 30-day timeline recommended by guidelines. Addition of drugs may be a preferred approach for intensifying treatment of patients at a high risk of treatment discontinuation.

TI  - Blood pressure reductions following catheter-based renal denervation are not related to improvements in adherence to antihypertensive drugs measured by urine/plasma toxicological analysis.
AB  - Renal denervation can reduce blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. The adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medication following renal denervation is unknown. This study investigated adherence to prescribed antihypertensive treatment by liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry in plasma and urine at baseline and 6 months after renal denervation in 100 patients with resistant hypertension, defined as baseline office systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg despite treatment with >3 antihypertensive agents. At baseline, complete adherence to all prescribed antihypertensive agents was observed in 52 patients, 46 patients were partially adherent, and two patients were completely non-adherent. Baseline office blood pressure was 167/88 +/- 19/16 mmHg with a corresponding 24-h blood pressure of 154/86 +/- 15/13 mmHg. Renal denervation significantly reduced office and ambulatory blood pressure at 6-month follow-up by 15/5 mmHg (p < 0.001/p < 0.001) and 8/4 mmHg (p < 0.001/p = 0.001), respectively. Mean adherence to prescribed treatment was significantly reduced from 85.0 % at baseline to 80.7 %, 6 months after renal denervation (p = 0.005). The blood pressure decrease was not explained by improvements in adherence following the procedure. Patients not responding to treatment significantly reduced their drug intake following the procedure. Adherence was highest for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and beta blockers (>90 %) and lowest for vasodilators (21 %). In conclusion, renal denervation can reduce office and ambulatory blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension despite a significant reduction in adherence to antihypertensive treatment after 6 months.

TI  - Effectiveness of Fixed-Dose Perindopril/Amlodipine on Clinic, Ambulatory and Self-Monitored Blood Pressure and Blood Pressure Variability: An Open-Label, Non Comparative Study in the General Practice.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of antihypertensive agents improve therapeutic efficacy, according to current guidelines and large clinical studies.
AB  - AIM: This Russian study examined the effect on blood pressure (BP) of substituting current ineffective antihypertensive treatment with FDC perindopril/amlodipine in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: BP was measured in the doctor's office at each visit, daily at home, and by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) at inclusion and end-of-study.
AB  - RESULTS: Ninety patients (52.7 +/- 12.2 years old; mean baseline BP 161.4/94.9 mmHg) at high or very high cardiovascular risk were included. FDC perindopril/amlodipine (5/5, 10/5 or 10/10 mg) exerted a rapid (2 weeks) and significant (p < 0.001) reduction in clinic BP, maintained after 3 months (-33.7/17.1 mmHg). ABPM and home monitoring showed that BP decrease remained significant throughout the study (p < 0.0001). BP variability was reduced, indicating the stable and homogeneous 24-h antihypertensive effect of FDC perindopril/amlodipine. Quality of life and adherence were also improved.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The three main methods of BP assessment showed that substituting ineffective antihypertensive therapy with FDC perindopril/amlodipine resulted in a rapid and pronounced antihypertensive effect, with target BP levels achieved after 3 months in most patients. This beneficial effect was observed also on various parameters related to BP variability, which may reflect additional cardioprotective properties.

TI  - Medication adherence and visit-to-visit variability of systolic blood pressure in African Americans with chronic kidney disease in the AASK trial.
AB  - Lower adherence to antihypertensive medications may increase visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure (VVV of BP), a risk factor for cardiovascular events and death. We used data from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) trial to examine whether lower medication adherence is associated with higher systolic VVV of BP in African Americans with hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Determinants of VVV of BP were also explored. AASK participants (n=988) were categorized by self-report or pill count as having perfect (100%), moderately high (75-99%), moderately low (50-74%) or low (<50%) proportion of study visits with high medication adherence over a 1-year follow-up period. We used multinomial logistic regression to examine determinants of medication adherence, and multivariable-adjusted linear regression to examine the association between medication adherence and systolic VVV of BP, defined as the coefficient of variation or the average real variability (ARV). Participants with lower self-reported adherence were generally younger and had a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions. Compared with perfect adherence, moderately high, moderately low and low adherence was associated with 0.65% (+/-0.31%), 0.99% (+/-0.31%) and 1.29% (+/-0.32%) higher systolic VVV of BP (defined as the coefficient of variation) in fully adjusted models. Results were qualitatively similar when using ARV or when using pill counts as the measure of adherence. Lower medication adherence is associated with higher systolic VVV of BP in African Americans with hypertensive CKD; efforts to improve medication adherence in this population may reduce systolic VVV of BP.

TI  - Pharmacist intervention in the prevention of heart failure for high-risk elderly patients in the community.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure has become one of the major causes of hospitalization worldwide. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia are the major causes of heart failure. In order to effectively prevent heart failure, blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels shall be closely monitored and controlled as well as medication adherence. This study aimed to investigate the role of pharmacist intervention in prevention of heart failure in high risk elderly patients in the community of Hong Kong.
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to investigate the role of pharmacist intervention in prevention of heart failure in highrisk elderly patients in the community of Hong Kong.
AB  - METHODS: This prospective uncontrolled study was conducted between July 2012 and April 2013 with two revisits every 3 to 4 months to review elderly patients' medication profiles as well as assess their blood pressure (BP), random capillary blood glucose (RCBG) level, cholesterol levels, signs and symptoms of heart failure and the compliance level. The results collected at the baseline data were analyzed and compared with those collected at the last follow-up visit.
AB  - RESULT: A significant increase in number of subjects free of symptoms of heart failure (31.88%, p<0.001) was found. For chronic disease management, significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol level (-0.86+/-0.56mmol/L, p=0.038) and triglyceride level (-1.15+/-1.09mmol/L, p<0.001) was observed in overall participants. Yet, no significant reduction in BP level or RCBG level was observed in overall subjects. Significant reduction in mean Morisky Medication Adherence Score (-0.54+/-1.50, p=0.005) indicated improvement in medication compliance in participants.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The Pharmacy Outreach service has a significant role in prevention of heart failure, by means of minimizing heart failure symptoms, improving medication compliance and enhancing chronic disease management, particularly cholesterol management in community elderly patients. This study provided a reference for further investigation and evaluation of the role of pharmacists in preventing heart failure in the high-risk community elderly patients.

TI  - Five year trends in dyslipidaemia prevalence and management in Switzerland: the CoLaus study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Data from prospective cohorts describing dyslipidaemia prevalence and treatment trends are lacking. Using data from the prospective CoLaus study, we aimed to examine changes in serum lipid levels, dyslipidaemia prevalence and management in a population-based sample of Swiss adults.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiovascular risk was assessed using PROCAM. Dyslipidaemia and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target levels were defined according to the Swiss Group for Lipids and Atherosclerosis. Complete baseline and follow up (FU) data were available for n = 4863 subjects during mean FU time of 5.6 years. Overall, 32.1% of participants were dyslipidaemic at baseline vs 46.3% at FU (p < 0.001). During this time, lipid lowering medication (LLM) rates among dyslipidaemic subjects increased from 34.0% to 39.2% (p < 0.001). In secondary prevention, LLM rates were 42.7% at baseline and 53.2% at FU (p = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, LLM use among dyslipidaemic subjects, between baseline and FU, was positively associated with personal history of CVD, older age, hypertension, higher BMI and diabetes, while negatively associated with higher educational level. Among treated subjects, LDL-C target achievement was positively associated with diabetes and negatively associated with personal history of CVD and higher BMI. Among subjects treated at baseline, LLM discontinuation was negatively associated with older age, male sex, smoking, hypertension and parental history of CVD.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In Switzerland, the increase over time in dyslipidaemia prevalence was not paralleled by a similar increase in LLM. In a real-life setting, dyslipidaemia management remains far from optimal, both in primary and secondary prevention.Copyright © 2015 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

TI  - Impact of a pharmacotherapy plan to improve adherence for patients with type-2 diabetes and hypertension in a Chilean hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to prescribed treatment is a principle cause of treatment failure in patients with chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension. Improved patient monitoring and education have been shown to improve adherence and clinical outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the impact of a pharmacotherapy optimization plan centered on patient education that was implemented at a hospital in Arauco, Chile.
AB  - METHODS: A prospective study was conducted using 50 randomly selected patients diagnosed with both T2DM and hypertension. Each patient participated in three successive interview sessions over 6 months. At each session, the following variables were evaluated by a pharmacist: blood pressure, HbA1c, adherence to prescribed medication, and patient knowledge of disease.
AB  - RESULTS: Significant decreases were observed for HbA1c (<0.001), and SBP (<0.001), with stronger and more significant decreases observed for females. Patient adherence to prescribed medication also improved, but not significantly. The number of patients with full knowledge of their diseases increased significantly (p < 0.001) from 10 to 66%.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the incorporation of a pharmacotherapeutic optimization plan for patients with chronic diseases can have a positive impact on the control of chronic diseases, such as T2DM and hypertension.

TI  - Clinical Effectiveness, Safety and Tolerability of Amlodipine/Valsartan in Hypertensive Patients: the Indonesian Subset of the EXCITE Study.
AB  - AIM: to assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of amlodipine/valsartan (Aml/Val) single-pill combination (SPC) in hypertensive patients in a real-world setting.
AB  - METHODS: the Indonesian subset of the EXCITE (clinical EXperience of amlodIpine and valsarTan in hypErtension) study, which was a multinational, prospective, observational, open study in hypertensive patients treated with Aml/Val SPC for 26 weeks. Aml/Val SPCs (5/80, 5/160, 10/160 mg) were administered as monotherapy or as add-on therapy to other antihypertensive medications in patients not controlled by prior monotherapy. The effectiveness outcomes were (1) mean decrease in sitting systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (msSBP and msDBP) from baseline to week 26; (2) proportion of patients achieving BP goal (<140/90 mmHg for nondiabetics, or <130/80 mmHg for diabetics); (3) proportion of patients who were responders (achieving BP goal or BP reduction of >20/10 mmHg). The safety variables were the incidence of AEs and SAEs, and the incidence of edema.
AB  - RESULTS: a total of 500 patients from Indonesia received Aml/Val SPC, 487 patients were analyzed for efficacy (by LOCF), and 464 patients completed the study. At study end (week 26), the overall msSBP and msDBP(95% CI) reductions from baseline were -33.7 (-35.2, -32.1) mmHg and -14.8 (-15.7, -13.8) mmHg, respectively. Among the 487 patients, 52.4% achieved BP goal and 80.5% were responders (LOCF). Among 464 patients who completed the study, 53.7% achieved BP goal and 84.5% were responders. Aml/Val SPC was effective in decreasing BP in Indonesian patients. AEs, including SAEs, were reported in 11.4% patients, with SAEs in 1% of patients, and death in 0.8% of patients. SAEs and deaths were considered unrelated to the study drug. Edema was reported by 9.4% of patients at baseline, and in 3.7% patients at end of study. Effectiveness, tolerability and compliance were rated good and very good in 90.8%, 92.2%, and 89.2% of patients, respectively, according to the investigators.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Aml/Val SPC was effective for BP reductions and well tolerated in hypertensive patients, not adequately controlled by monotherapy, in a daily clinical setting in Indonesia.

TI  - Case Study: Community Engagement and Clinical Trial Success: Outreach to African American Women.
AB  - This brief report examines how the use of community engagement principles and approaches enhanced clinical trial recruitment and retention. The Community-Engaged Research Core (CERC), a CTSA-supported resource designed to facilitate community involvement in clinical and translational research, was consulted to provide assistance with the implementation of the clinical trial, and specifically to enhance participation of the target population-African American women. CERC's key recommendations included: (1) convene a Community Engagement Studio, (2) redesign the recruitment advertisement, (3) simplify the language used to explain the scope of the study, and (4) provide transportation for participants. As a result of these interventions, a comprehensive strategy to recruit, enroll, and retain participants was formulated. After implementation of the plan by the study team, enrollment increased 78% and recruitment goals were met 16 months ahead of schedule. Participant retention and study drug adherence was 100%. We conclude that community engagement is essential to the development of an effective multifaceted plan to improve recruitment of underrepresented groups in clinical trials.

TI  - The Facilitators of and Barriers to Adherence to Hypertension Treatment Scale.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of adherence to recommended regimens is a major cause of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) among African/Black American (AA) women. The national initiative to increase BP control among AAs by 50% makes clear the need for culturally appropriate instruments to assess facilitators of adherence to treatment of hypertension (high BP [HBP]).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a culturally sensitive measure of facilitators of and barriers to adherence to hypertension treatment regimens for AA women.
AB  - METHODS: We developed the Facilitators of and Barriers to Adherence to Hypertension Treatment Scale (FATS) with input from focus groups with 20 AA women. A total of 147 AA women from a federally funded inner-city clinic in Los Angeles were enrolled in the study and 70 (48%) completed the survey. Internal consistency reliability was estimated using Cronbach's alpha.
AB  - RESULTS: Coefficient alpha for the 18-item FATS was 78. In a multivariate regression model, controlling for BP stage, the FATS was significantly associated with the Hill-Bone High Blood Pressure Compliance Scale (standardized beta = .35; P = .0014), the Enhancing Recovery From Coronary Heart Disease Social Support Inventory (beta = .42; P = .001), the and CAGE (cut down on your drinking, annoyed by being criticized for your drinking, guilty about drinking, and eye-opener drink in the morning) alcohol screening instrument (beta = -.24; P = .05).
AB  - DISCUSSION: The FATS is a culturally sensitive measure for assessing adherence to treatment regimens of HBP in AA women. Further study in other samples of AA women is needed to confirm that the FATS adequately assesses facilitators of adherence to regimens for HBP in AA women.

TI  - An analysis of the blood pressure and safety outcomes to renal denervation in African Americans and Non-African Americans in the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial.
AB  - SYMPLICITY HTN-3, the first trial of renal denervation (RDN) versus sham, enrolled 26% African Americans, a prospectively stratified cohort. Although the 6-month systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction in African Americans (AAs) was similar in the RDN group (-15.5 +/- 25.4 mm Hg, n = 85 vs. -17.8 +/- 29.2, n = 49, P = .641), the sham SBP response was 9.2 mm Hg greater (P = .057) in AAs than non-AAs. In multivariate analyses, sham SBP response was predicted by an interaction between AA and a complex antihypertensive regimen (at least one antihypertensive medication prescribed >3 times daily), while in the RDN group, SBP response was predicted by an interaction between AA race and baseline BP > 180 mm Hg. AA race did not independently predict SBP response in either sham or RDN. There appears to be effect modification by race with individual-level patient characteristics in both treatment arms that affect the observed pattern of SBP responses.Copyright © 2015 American Society of Hypertension.

TI  - Glaucoma, "the silent thief of sight": patients' perspectives and health seeking behaviour in Bauchi, northern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Nigeria, glaucoma has a high prevalence and is the second cause of blindness among adults after cataract. People with glaucoma frequently present very late with advanced disease, and acceptance of and adherence to treatment is low. The purpose of the study was to explore how patients' understand and respond to glaucoma in order develop an intervention to improve adherence to treatment.
AB  - METHOD: Hospital based qualitative study. Six focus group discussions were held with patients with advanced disease and who had either undergone glaucoma surgery, were receiving medical treatment, or had neither surgery nor medical treatment. Two traditional healers who treat eye conditions were interviewed. Audio files were transcribed, translated into English and recurring themes coded and categorized as the impact of vision loss, and understandings of the disease and its management.
AB  - RESULTS: Visual loss impacted significantly on the lives of people with glaucoma in many ways. Many heard the term "glaucoma" for the first time during the study. Local terms to describe the symptoms included Hawan jinin ido ("hypertension of the eye"). Patients sought treatment in pharmacies, or with traditional healers who had different interpretations of glaucoma and its treatment to biomedical understandings. Cost and forgetfulness were the main reasons for low adherence to treatment while fear was a reason for not accepting surgery. Lack of money and negative staff attitudes were reasons for low follow up.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Halting the progression of glaucoma is possible with treatment but the condition will remain a "silent thief of sight" in West Africa unless awareness, uptake of services and adherence to treatment improve. Understanding how glaucoma is locally conceptualised, lived with and responded to by patients is essential to aid the design of interventions to prevent glaucoma blindness in Africa. Findings have been used to adapt a motivational interviewing intervention, which is being evaluated in a clinical trial.

TI  - Positive airway pressure improves nocturnal beat-to-beat blood pressure surges in obesity hypoventilation syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea.
AB  - Positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment has been shown to have a modest effect on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, there is a paucity of data on the effect of PAP therapy on rapid, yet significant, BP swings during sleep, particularly in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). The present study hypothesizes that PAP therapy will improve nocturnal BP on the first treatment night (titration PAP) in OHS patients with underlying OSA, and that these improvements will become more significant with 6 wk of PAP therapy. Seventeen adults (7 men, 10 women; age 50.4 +/- 10.7 years, BMI 49.3 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2)) with OHS and clinically diagnosed OSA participated in three overnight laboratory visits that included polysomnography and beat-to-beat BP monitoring via finger plethysmography. Six weeks of PAP therapy, but not titration PAP, lowered mean nocturnal BP. In contrast, when nocturnal beat-to-beat BPs were aggregated into bins consisting of at least three consecutive cardiac cycles with a >10 mmHg BP surge (i.e., DELTA10-20, DELTA20-30, DELTA30-40, and DELTA>40 mmHg), titration, and 6-wk PAP reduced the number of BP surges per hour (time x bin, P < 0.05). PAP adherence over the 6-wk period was significantly correlated to reductions in nocturnal systolic (r = 0.713, P = 0.001) and diastolic (r = 0.497, P = 0.043) BP surges. Despite these PAP-induced improvements in nocturnal beat-to-beat BP surges, 6 wk of PAP therapy did not alter daytime BP. In conclusion, PAP treatment reduces nocturnal beat-to-beat BP surges in OHS patients with underlying OSA, and this improvement in nocturnal BP regulation was greater in patients with higher PAP adherence.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

TI  - Cardiovascular risk management in type 2 diabetes of more than 10-year duration: Results of Polish ARETAEUS2-Grupa Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: ARETAEUS 1 study showed that a great majority of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) of short duration did not meet all of the treatment goals. Since then the treatment goals in T2DM have been changed. The aim of the ARETAEUS 2-Grupa Study was to assess cardiovascular (CV) risk management and meeting treatment goals in the population of T2DM of more than 10-year duration.
AB  - METHODS: ARETAEUS2-Grupa was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study conducted in Poland in 2012. Randomly selected physicians recruited 1,740 patients with T2DM diagnosed more than 10 years before the study.
AB  - RESULTS: Lipid treatment goals were met respectively: for total cholesterol in 34.5% of all patients, triglycerides in 53.8%, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in 26.5% and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in 38.2%. Most of patients with and without coronary artery disease were receiving aspirin (90.3% and 60%, respectively) and statins (84.4% and 67.7%, respectively). The current blood pressure (BP) goal (140/90 mm Hg) was met in 43.5% of patients and the previous goal (< 130/80 mm Hg) in 12.4%. The patients were mainly treated with > 3 antihypertensive drugs. All treatment goals (for HbA1c, BP and LDL-C) were reached only by 8.2% of patients, any two goals by 26.3% of patients, one goal by 39.8% of patients, none by 25.6% of patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The new less restrictive treatment goals are reached more frequently but still much is to be done in the field of clinical practice guidelines implementation and CV prevention in T2DM population.

TI  - Multifaceted Prospective Memory Intervention to Improve Medication Adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test whether a multifaceted prospective memory intervention improved adherence to antihypertensive medications and to assess whether executive function and working memory processes moderated the intervention effects.
AB  - DESIGN: Two-group longitudinal randomized control trial.
AB  - SETTING: Community.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older without signs of dementia or symptoms of severe depression who were self-managing prescribed medication.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: After 4 weeks of initial adherence monitoring using a medication event monitoring system, individuals with 90% or less adherence were randomly assigned to groups.
AB  - INTERVENTION: The prospective memory intervention was designed to provide strategies that switch older adults from relying on executive function and working memory processes (that show effects of cognitive aging) to mostly automatic associative processes (that are relatively spared with normal aging) for remembering to take medications. Strategies included establishing a routine, establishing cues strongly associated with medication taking actions, performing the action immediately upon thinking about it, using a medication organizer, and imagining medication taking to enhance encoding and improve cuing.
AB  - RESULTS: There was significant improvement in adherence in the intervention group (57% at baseline to 78% after the intervention), but most of these gains were lost after 5 months. The control condition started at 68% and was stable during the intervention, but dropped to 62%. Executive function and working memory moderated the intervention effect, with the intervention producing greater benefit for those with lower executive function and working memory.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention improved adherence, but the benefits were not sustained. Further research is needed to determine how to sustain the substantial initial benefits.© 2016, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2016, The American Geriatrics Society.

TI  - A Successful Multifaceted Trial to Improve Hypertension Control in Primary Care: Why Did it Work?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is important to understand which components of successful multifaceted interventions are responsible for study outcomes, since some components may be more important contributors to the intervention effect than others.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conducted a mediation analysis to determine which of seven factors had the greatest effect on change in systolic blood pressure (BP) after 6 months in a trial to improve hypertension control.
AB  - DESIGN: The study was a preplanned secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized clinical trial. Eight clinics in an integrated health system were randomized to provide usual care to their patients (n=222), and eight were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n=228).
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred three of 450 trial participants completing the 6-month follow-up visit were included.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Intervention group participants received home BP telemonitors and transmitted measurements to pharmacists, who adjusted medications and provided advice to improve adherence to medications and lifestyle modification via telephone visits.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Path analytic models estimated indirect effects of the seven potential mediators of intervention effect (defined as the difference between the intervention and usual care groups in change in systolic BP from baseline to 6 months). The potential mediators were change in home BP monitor use, number of BP medication classes, adherence to BP medications, physical activity, salt intake, alcohol use, and weight.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: The difference in change in systolic BP was 11.3 mmHg. The multivariable mediation model explained 47 % (5.3 mmHg) of the intervention effect. Nearly all of this was mediated by two factors: an increase in medication treatment intensity (24 %) and increased home BP monitor use (19 %). The other five factors were not significant mediators, although medication adherence and salt intake improved more in the intervention group than in the usual care group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Most of the explained intervention effect was attributable to the combination of self-monitoring and medication intensification. High adherence at baseline and the relatively low intensity of resources directed toward lifestyle change may explain why these factors did not contribute to the improvement in BP.

TI  - Managing Medication Adherence in Elderly Hypertensive Patients Through Pharmacist Home Visits.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the Managing Your Blood Pressure program was to reduce health disparities in blood pressure (BP) control by improving medication adherence in a cohort of geriatric African-Americans with hypertension (HTN).
AB  - DESIGN: The program was implemented using a quasi-experimental pre- and postintervention study design that utilized a pharmacist home-based model and follow-up educational phone calls to impact BP over a six-month period.
AB  - SETTING: Home visits occurred in participants' residences, and phone calls occurred at program headquarters at Texas Southern University (Houston, Texas).
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was BP control rate, and secondary outcome measures were knowledge of HTN, medication adherence, and use of a BP monitor.
AB  - RESULTS: At six months, 306 of the 431 patients recruited completed all phases of the program (two in-home consultations and biweekly telephone consultations). At the end of the six-month intervention period, the reduction in mean systolic BP was statistically significant (baseline 140 mmHg vs. six months 137 mmHg; P < 0.049). No difference in mean diastolic BP pre- and postintervention was found. The percent of patients with controlled BP improved from 46.7% to 49.5%; P = 0.34. Medication adherence, self-monitoring of BP, and knowledge of HTN were significantly improved from baseline to postintervention.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-led interventions in the home were effective in improving BP control and medication adherence. Further programs are needed to address uncontrolled HTN in this vulnerable population.

TI  - Adherence to Mediterranean Diet Offers an Additive Protection Over the Use of Statin Therapy: Results from the ATTICA Study (2002-2012).
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The protective role of Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been extensively discussed in the literature, but its incremental effect over the use of CVD risk reducing agents (such as hypolipidemic treatment) has rarely been evaluated.
AB  - METHODS: The ATTICA study was carried out in the Athens area during 2001-2002 and included 3042 participants free of CVD at baseline (49.8% men, aged 18-89 years). Adherence to Mediterranean diet was assessed using the MedDietScore (range 0-55) and statin use was recorded for all subjects. During 2011-2012, 2583 out of the 3042 baseline participants attended the 10-year follow-up of the ATTICA study (15% lost-to-follow-up) and CVD development was recorded.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence to Mediterranean diet (highest tertile) decreased CVD risk by 29.3% (Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.707, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 0.537-0.831) as compared with the lowest tertile, independently of statin use. Patients with hyperlipidemia on a statin that adopted unhealthy dietary habits (lowest tertile) had 75% increased CVD risk than normolipidemic subjects with healthy dietary habits (HR=1.75, 95%CI: 1.33-2.29). The addition of Mediterranean diet tertiles in the multivariable model reclassified 46.7% of the participants to CVD risk categories.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Adherence to Mediterranean diet confers a considerable reduction in CVD risk, independently of gender, age, family history of CVD, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, hypertension and physical activity status. Therefore, CVD prevention strategies should involve the implementation of a Mediterranean diet in both the general population and patients on a statin.

TI  - [One year persistence of atorvastatin and amlodipine fixed dose combination versus atorvastatin therapy]. [Hungarian]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypertension and dyslipidemia are modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. In Hungary hypertension and dyslipidemia are quite frequent conditions. The patients' adherence is very important factor to reach the targets.
AB  - AIM: The aim of the authors was to investigate the one-year persistence of the atorvastatin therapy and atorvastatin and amlodipine fixed dose combination.
AB  - METHOD: National Health Insurance Found prescriptions database of Hungary on pharmacy claims between October 1, 2012 and September 30, 2013 was analyzed. The authors identified patients who filled prescriptions for atorvastatin and amlodipine fixed dose combination and atorvastatin prescribed for the first time. Patients did not receive similar drugs for one year before the study. To model the persistence, the apparatus of survival analysis was used, where "survival" was the time to abandon the medication. As it was available to month precision, discrete time survival analysis was applied: a generalized linear model was estimated with complementary log-log link function with the kind of drug being the only explanatory variable.
AB  - RESULTS: During the trial period, atorvastatin and atorvastatin plus amlodipine fixed dose combination was started in 192,579 and 24,433 patients, respectively. One year persistence rate in patients with atorvastatin and amlodipine fixed dose combination was 43%, and 21% in patients with atorvastatin therapy. The 360-days-restricted study period, the mean duration of persistence was 221.4 (SE: 0.894) days in patients on atorvastatin and amlodipine fixed dose combination and 153.0 days (SE: 0.297) in those on atorvastatin regimen. The hazard of discontinuation was almost twofold higher during treatment with atorvastatin therapy compared with the use of the atorvastatin and amlodipine fixed dose combination (hazard ratio = 1.85, p<0.0001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant difference between the one-year persistence of atorvastatin therapy and atorvastatin plus amlodipine fixed dose combination. The result demonstrate that atorvastatin and amlodipine fixed dose combination is favourable to reach double goals on blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol.

TI  - Pharmacist intervention in improving hypertension-related knowledge, treatment medication adherence and health-related quality of life: a non-clinical randomized controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study evaluated whether a pharmaceutical care intervention can result in better understanding about hypertension, increase medication adherence to antihypertensive therapy and improve overall health-related quality of life.
AB  - METHODS: A non-clinical randomized control trial was conducted whereby participants received an educational intervention through hospital pharmacists. Hypertension knowledge, medication adherence and health-related quality of life were measured by means of self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic and disease characteristics of the patients. Inferential statistics were used for inter- and intragroup comparisons. SPSS 17 was used for data analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-five hypertensive patients were randomly assigned (192 in the control group and 193 in the intervention group) to the study. No significant differences were observed in either group for age, gender, income, locality, education, occupation or duration of disease. There was, however, a significant increase in the participants' levels of knowledge about hypertension and medication adherence among the interventional group after completing the intervention. Significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were also observed among the interventional group after completion of the intervention. The interventional group, however, reported decreased yet significant health-related quality of life at the end of the interventional programme.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Pharmacist intervention can significantly increase disease-related knowledge, blood pressure control and medication adherence in patients with hypertension. However, further research is needed to address the decreased health-related quality of life after completion of the study.Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Medication Routines and Adherence Among Hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - Poor adherence to prescribed medication regimens remains an important challenge preventing successful treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. While studies have documented differences in the time of day or weekday vs weekend on medication adherence, no study has examined whether having a medication-taking routine contributes to increased medication adherence. The purpose of this study was to: (1) identify patients' sociodemographic factors associated with consistent medication-taking routine; (2) examine associations between medication-taking consistency, medication adherence, and blood pressure (BP) control. The study included black patients with hypertension (n = 190; 22 men and 168 women; age, mean+/-standard deviation 54 +/- 12.08 years) who completed a practice-based randomized controlled trial. Findings showed that medication-taking consistency was significantly associated with better medication adherence (F = 9.54, P = .002). Associations with the consistency index were not statistically significant for diastolic BP control (odds ratio, 1.319; 95% confidence interval, 0.410-4.246; P = .642) and systolic BP control (odds ratio, 0.621; 95% confidence interval, 0.195-1.974; P = .419).

TI  - Association between perceived life chaos and medication adherence in a postmyocardial infarction population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefits of medication adherence to control cardiovascular disease (CVD) are well defined, yet multiple studies have identified poor adherence. The influence of life chaos on medication adherence is unknown. Because this is a novel application of an instrument, our preliminary objective was to understand patient factors associated with chaos. The main objective was to evaluate the extent to which an instrument designed to measure life chaos is associated with CVD-medication nonadherence.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: Using baseline data from an ongoing randomized trial to improve postmyocardial infarction (MI) management, multivariable logistic regression identified the association between life chaos and CVD-medication nonadherence. Patients had hypertension and a myocardial infarction in the past 3 years (n=406). Nearly 43% reported CVD-medication nonadherence in the past month. In simple linear regression, the following were associated with higher life chaos: medication nonadherence (beta=1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-2.76), female sex (beta=1.22; 95% CI [0.22-2.24]), minority race (beta=1.72; 95% CI [0.78-2.66]), having less than high school education (beta=2.05; 95% CI [0.71-3.39]), low health literacy (beta=2.06; 95% CI [0.86-3.26]), and inadequate financial status (beta=1.93; 95% CI [0.87-3.00]). Being married (beta=-2.09, 95% CI [-3.03 to -1.15]) was associated with lower life chaos. As chaos quartile increased, patients exhibited more nonadherence. In logistic regression, adjusting for sex, race, marital status, employment, education, health literacy, and financial status, a 1-unit life chaos increase was associated with a 7% increase (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% CI [1.02-1.12]) in odds of reporting medication nonadherence.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that life chaos may be an important determinant of medication adherence. Life chaos screenings could identify those at risk for nonadherence.

TI  - Mobile Phone Text Messages to Support Treatment Adherence in Adults With High Blood Pressure (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]): A Single-Blind, Randomized Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the effect of automated treatment adherence support delivered via mobile phone short message system (SMS) text messages on blood pressure.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: In this pragmatic, single-blind, 3-arm, randomized trial (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]) undertaken in South Africa, patients treated for high blood pressure were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to information only, interactive SMS text messaging, or usual care. The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure at 12 months from baseline measured with a validated oscillometric device. All trial staff were masked to treatment allocation. Analyses were intention to treat. Between June 26, 2012, and November 23, 2012, 1372 participants were randomized to receive information-only SMS text messages (n=457), interactive SMS text messages (n=458), or usual care (n=457). Primary outcome data were available for 1256 participants (92%). At 12 months, the mean adjusted change in systolic blood pressure compared with usual care was -2.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -4.4 to -0.04) with information-only SMS and -1.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -3.7 to 0.6) with interactive SMS. Odds ratios for the proportion of participants with a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg were 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.95) for information-only messaging and 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.95) for interactive messaging compared with usual care.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial of an automated adherence support program delivered by SMS text message in a general outpatient population of adults with high blood pressure, we found a small reduction in systolic blood pressure control compared with usual care at 12 months. There was no evidence that an interactive intervention increased this effect.

TI  - A community-driven hypertension treatment group in rural Honduras.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We formed a self-funded hypertension treatment group in a resource-poor community in rural Honduras. After training community health workers and creating protocols for standardized treatment, we used group membership fees to maintain the group, purchase generic medications in bulk on the local market, and hire a physician to manage treatment. We then assessed whether participation in the group improved treatment, medication adherence, and hypertension control.
AB  - DESIGN: This is a program evaluation using quasi-experimental design and no control group. Using data from the 86 members of the hypertension treatment group, we analyzed baseline and follow-up surveys of members, along with 30 months of clinical records of treatment, medication adherence, and blood pressure readings.
AB  - RESULTS: Our initial hypertension needs assessment revealed that at baseline, community hypertensives relied on the local Ministry of Health clinic as their source of anti-hypertensive medications and reported that irregular supply interfered with medication adherence. At baseline, hypertension group members were mainly female, overweight or obese, physically active, non-smoking, and non-drinking. After 30 months of managing the treatment group, we found a significant increase in medication adherence, from 54.8 to 76.2% (p<0.01), and hypertension control (<140/90 mmHg), from 31.4 to 54.7% (p<0.01). We also found a mean monthly decrease of 0.39 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (p<0.01). At the end of the 30-month observation period, the local Ministry of Health system had increased provision of low-cost anti-hypertensive medications and adopted the hypertension treatment group's treatment protocols.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Formation of a self-funded, community-based hypertension treatment group in a rural, resource-poor community is feasible, and group participation may improve treatment, medication adherence, and hypertension control and can serve as a political driver for improving hypertension treatment services provided by the public system.

TI  - Medication Adherence and the Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality and Hospitalization Among Patients With Newly Prescribed Antihypertensive Medications.
AB  - The importance of adherence to antihypertensive treatments for the prevention of cardiovascular disease has not been well elucidated. This study evaluated the effect of antihypertensive medication adherence on specific cardiovascular disease mortality (ischemic heart disease [IHD], cerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral infarction). Our study used data from a 3% sample cohort that was randomly extracted from enrollees of Korean National Health Insurance. Study subjects were aged >20 years, were diagnosed with hypertension, and started newly prescribed antihypertensive medication in 2003 to 2004. Adherence to antihypertensive medication was estimated as the cumulative medication adherence. Subjects were divided into good (cumulative medication adherence, >80%), intermediate (cumulative medication adherence, 50%-80%), and poor (cumulative medication adherence, <50%) adherence groups. We used time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between medication adherence and health outcomes. Among 33728 eligible subjects, 670 (1.99%) died of coronary heart disease or stroke during follow-up. Patients with poor medication adherence had worse mortality from IHD (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.31; P for trend=0.005), cerebral hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-3.77; P for trend=0.004), and cerebral infarction (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.96; P for trend=0.003) than those with good adherence. The estimated hazard ratios of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease were consistent with the mortality end point. Poor medication adherence was associated with higher mortality and a greater risk of hospitalization for specific cardiovascular diseases, emphasizing the importance of a monitoring system and strategies to improve medication adherence in clinical practice.

TI  - Oral aspirin for treating venous leg ulcers. [Review]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) or varicose ulcers are the final stage of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), and are the most common type of leg ulcer. The development of VLUs on ankles and lower legs can occur spontaneously or after minor trauma. The ulcers are often painful and exudative, healing is often protracted and recurrence is common. This cycle of healing and recurrence has a considerable impact on the health and quality of life of individuals, and healthcare and socioeconomic costs. VLUs are a common and costly problem worldwide; prevalence is estimated to be between 1.65% to 1.74% in the western world and is more common in adults aged 65 years and older. The main treatment for a VLU is a firm compression bandage. Compression assists by reducing venous hypertension, enhancing venous return and reducing peripheral oedema. However, studies show that it only has moderate effects on healing, with up to 50% of VLUs unhealed after two years of compression. Non-adherence may be the principal cause of these poor results, but presence of inflammation in people with CVI may be another factor, so a treatment that suppresses inflammation (healing ulcers more quickly) and reduces the frequency of ulcer recurrence (thereby prolonging time between recurrent episodes) would be an invaluable intervention to complement compression treatments. Oral aspirin may have a significant impact on VLU clinical practice worldwide. Evidence for the effectiveness of aspirin on ulcer healing and recurrence in high quality RCTs is currently lacking.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of oral aspirin on the healing and recurrence of venous leg ulcers.
AB  - SEARCH METHODS: In May 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. Additional searches were made in trial registers and reference lists of relevant publications for published or ongoing trials. There were no language or publication date restrictions.
AB  - SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral aspirin with placebo or no drug intervention (in the presence or absence of compression therapy) for treating people with venous leg ulcers. Our main outcomes were time to complete ulcer healing, rate of change in the area of the ulcer, proportion of ulcers healed in the trial period, major bleeding, pain, mortality, adverse events and ulcer recurrence (time for recurrence and proportion of recurrence).
AB  - DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of each included trial and assessed overall quality of evidence for the main outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' table.
AB  - MAIN RESULTS: The electronic search located 62 studies. We included two RCTs of oral aspirin (300 mg/daily) given in addition to compression compared with compression and placebo, or compression alone. To date, the impact of aspirin on VLUs has been examined by only two randomised clinical trials, both with a small number of participants. The first RCT was conducted in the United Kingdom (n=20) and reported that daily administration of aspirin (300mg) in addition to compression bandages increased both the rate of healing, and the number of participants healed when compared to placebo in addition to compression bandaging over a four month period. Thirty-eight per cent of the participants given aspirin reported complete healing compared with 0% in the placebo group . Improvement (assessed by reduction in wound size) occurred in 52% of the participants taking aspirin compared with 26% in those taking placebo). The study identified potential benefits of taking aspirin as an adjunct to compression but the sample size was small, and neither the mechanism by which aspirin improved healing nor its effects on recurrence were investigated.In 2012 an RCT in Spain (n=51) compared daily administration of aspirin (300mg) in addition to compression bandages with compression alone over a five month period. There was little difference in complete healing rates between groups (21/28 aspirin and 17/23 compression bandages alone) but the average time to healing was shorter (12 weeks in the treated group vs 22 weeks in the compression only group) and the average time for recurrence was longer in the aspirin group (39 days: [SD 6.0] compared with 16.3 days [SD 7.5] in the compression only group). Although this trial provides some limited data about the potential use of aspirin therapy, the sample size (only 20 patients) was too small for us to draw meaningful conclusions. In addition, patients were only followed up for 4 months and no information on placebo was reported.
AB  - AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low quality evidence from two trials indicate that there is currently insufficient evidence for us to draw definitive conclusions about the benefits and harms of oral aspirin on the healing and recurrence of venous leg ulcers. We downgraded the evidence to low quality due to potential selection bias and imprecision due to the small sample size. The small number of participants may have a hidden real benefit, or an increase in harm. Due to the lack of reliable evidence, we are unable to draw conclusions about the benefits and harms of oral daily aspirin as an adjunct to compression in VLU healing or recurrence. Further high quality studies are needed in this area.

TI  - Blood pressure changes after catheter-based renal denervation are related to reductions in total peripheral resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal denervation (RDN) can reduce sympathetic activity and blood pressure (BP) in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. The exact mechanisms by which RDN results in BP reductions are yet not fully established.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: This study investigated the effects of RDN on office BP, 24-h ambulatory BP, noninvasive 10-min beat-to-beat digital pulse wave analysis, total peripheral resistance (TPR), cardiac output, and plasma renin and aldosterone serum concentrations in 30 patients with resistant hypertension. Adherence to antihypertensive drugs was assessed by liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry analysis in plasma and urine at baseline and at 6 month. RDN significantly reduced office BP, beat-to-beat BP, and 24-h ambulatory BP by 19/6 (P = 0.021/P = 0.012), 12/7 (P = 0.005/P = 0.005), and 10/5  mmHg (P = 0.001/P = 0.049) at 6 months, respectively. TPR decreased from 1696 to 1377  dyn x s/cm (-19%; P = 0.027). This reduction was not associated with significant changes in cardiac output. The changes in office, ambulatory, and beat-to-beat BP correlated with the reductions of TPR. Adherence to antihypertensive treatment remained unchanged during the study period (84.7% at baseline, 83.6% at 6 months, P = 0.782).
AB  - CONCLUSION: RDN reduced office BP, beat-to-beat BP, and 24-h ambulatory BP in patients with resistant hypertension after 6 months. The BP changes were associated with reductions in peripheral resistance, whereas cardiac output, plasma renin, and aldosterone levels remained unchanged. The observed effects were not explained by an increased intake of antihypertensive medications.

TI  - True antihypertensive efficacy of sequential nephron blockade in patients with resistant hypertension and confirmed medication adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed the influence of medication adherence on blood pressure (BP) control and target organ damage in a pre-specified analysis of a published trial comparing sequential nephron blockade (SNB) or sequential renin-angiotensin system blockade (SRASB) in patients with resistant hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Patients were randomized to SNB (n = 82) or SRASB (n = 82) and studied at baseline and after 12 weeks. BP was measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by applanation tonometry and left ventricular mass (LVM) by echocardiography. Low medication adherence was assessed through plasma irbesartan concentration below 20 ng/ml; urinary N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline/creatinine ratio below 4  nmol/mmol; last medication intake before visit greater than 24 h and pill counting below 80% of theoretical intake. Medication adherence score (sum of items, max = 4) is defined as low (medication adherence score <2) or acceptable (medication adherence score >2).
AB  - RESULTS: Among 164 patients, 134 (81.7%) had acceptable medication adherence and 30 (18.3%) low medication adherence, with similar proportions in the SNB and SRASB arms. After 12 weeks, in patients with acceptable medication adherence, BP was more frequently controlled in those treated with SNB (64%), than SRASB (18%; P < 0.001). The difference in daytime SBP was -11.5  mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) -15.4 to -7.5, P < 0.0001] in patients with acceptable medication adherence. In contrast, in patients with low medication adherence, the difference between groups was smaller and not significant (-9.4  mmHg, 95% CI -20.4 to 1.7, P = 0.09). Independently of BP changes, PWV and LVM decreased more in the SNB than in the SRASB arm when medication adherence was acceptable (-0.52 m/s, 95% CI -1.3 to -0.007, P = 0.047; and -24 g/m, 95% CI -36 to -12, P = 0.0003), whereas no significant changes were observed in low medication adherence patients.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Medication adherence contributes to BP-lowering and regression of target organ damage. The differential effects of SNB and SRASB is observed in patients with acceptable medication adherence, and not in patients with low medication adherence.

TI  - Baseline characteristics of African Americans in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.
AB  - The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) will compare treatment to a systolic blood pressure goal of <120 mm Hg to treatment to the currently recommended goal of <140 mm Hg for effects on incident cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic outcomes including cognitive decline. The objectives of this analysis are to compare baseline characteristics of African American (AA) and non-AA SPRINT participants and explore factors associated with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) by race. SPRINT enrolled 9361 hypertensive participants aged older than 50 years. This cross-sectional analysis examines sociodemographics, baseline characteristics, and study measures among AAs compared with non-AAs. AAs made up 31% of participants. AAs (compared with non-AAs) were younger and less frequently male, had less education, and were more likely uninsured or covered by Medicaid. In addition, AAs scored lower on the cognitive screening test when compared with non-AAs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found BP control rates to <140/90 mm Hg were higher for AAs who were male, had higher number of chronic diseases, were on diuretic treatment, and had better medication adherence. SPRINT is well poised to examine the effects of systolic blood pressure targets on clinical outcomes as well as predictors influencing BP control in AAs.

TI  - Blood-Pressure and Cholesterol Lowering in Persons without Cardiovascular Disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated blood pressure and elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Lowering both should reduce the risk of cardiovascular events substantially.
AB  - METHODS: In a trial with 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 12,705 participants at intermediate risk who did not have cardiovascular disease to rosuvastatin (10 mg per day) or placebo and to candesartan (16 mg per day) plus hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg per day) or placebo. In the analyses reported here, we compared the 3180 participants assigned to combined therapy (with rosuvastatin and the two antihypertensive agents) with the 3168 participants assigned to dual placebo. The first coprimary outcome was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, and the second coprimary outcome additionally included heart failure, cardiac arrest, or revascularization. The median follow-up was 5.6 years.
AB  - RESULTS: The decrease in the LDL cholesterol level was 33.7 mg per deciliter (0.87 mmol per liter) greater in the combined-therapy group than in the dual-placebo group, and the decrease in systolic blood pressure was 6.2 mm Hg greater with combined therapy than with dual placebo. The first coprimary outcome occurred in 113 participants (3.6%) in the combined-therapy group and in 157 (5.0%) in the dual-placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.90; P=0.005). The second coprimary outcome occurred in 136 participants (4.3%) and 187 participants (5.9%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.89; P=0.003). Muscle weakness and dizziness were more common in the combined-therapy group than in the dual-placebo group, but the overall rate of discontinuation of the trial regimen was similar in the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The combination of rosuvastatin (10 mg per day), candesartan (16 mg per day), and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg per day) was associated with a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular events than dual placebo among persons at intermediate risk who did not have cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Self-transcendence and medication adherence in older adults with hypertension.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between self-transcendence and medication adherence among older adults prescribed antihypertensive medication.
AB  - DESIGN: Descriptive, correlational research design.
AB  - METHOD: Forty-six older adults who were prescribed antihypertensive medications from an independent living facility participated in this study. Participants were given a survey that included a demographic questionnaire, the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, and Reed's Self-Transcendence Scale.
AB  - FINDINGS: No significant relationship was found between medication adherence and self-transcendence (r = -.20, p = .18). Ninety percent of the participants however, admitted to cutting back or stopping their medication without notifying their providers.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Continued investigation is needed to identify reasons why older adults fail to adhere to taking prescribed hypertension medications in order to improve health outcomes in this population.Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.

TI  - Effect of benzalkonium chloride-free travoprost on intraocular pressure and ocular surface symptoms in patients with glaucoma previously on latanoprost: an open-label study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostaglandin analogs reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension; however, these medications may affect the ocular surface and elicit ocular discomfort when preserved with benzalkonium chloride (BAK).
AB  - METHODS: This was an open-label, single-arm study conducted in Latin America from February 2012 to May 2013. Patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were intolerant of latanoprost 0.005 % were transitioned to receive once-daily BAK-free travoprost 0.004 % containing polyquaternium-1 (Travatan preserved with POLYQUAD [PQ], Alcon Laboratories, Inc; Fort Worth, TX) for 12 weeks. Mean change in IOP from baseline (primary efficacy endpoint) and the percentage of patients who achieved a target IOP of <18 mmHg were evaluated at all on-therapy visits. Ocular hyperemia, patient preference, and self-projected adherence were assessed at week 12. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study.
AB  - RESULTS: All enrolled patients were included in the analysis (n=191); the majority of patients (90.6 %, n=173/191) completed the study. Mean (SD) patient age was 67.5 (11.3) years, and mean baseline IOP was 14.8 mmHg. Mean IOP was reduced by 0.94 mmHg at week 6 and by 1.09 mmHg at week 12 (P<0.001 for both). A greater percentage of patients achieved a target IOP of <18 mmHg at week 6 (93.1 %; n=163/175) and week 12 (93.3 %; n=166/178) compared with baseline (89.5 %; n=171/191). There was a 10.5 % increase in the percentage of patients with "none/trace" amounts of hyperemia. Most patients preferred the study medication (81.5 %; n=141/173) and were confident that they would adhere to their preferred medication (90.8 %; n=157/173). No serious AEs were reported, and eye irritation (3.7 %; n=7/191) was the most common treatment-related AE.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Transitioning from BAK-containing latanoprost 0.005 % to BAK-free travoprost 0.004 % preserved with PQ reduced IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were intolerant of latanoprost. BAK-free travoprost 0.004 % is a viable alternative for patients who require switching their IOP-lowering medications because of tolerability issues.

TI  - Sharing Physician Notes Through an Electronic Portal is Associated With Improved Medication Adherence: Quasi-Experimental Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In surveys, interviews, and focus groups, patients taking medications and offered Web portal access to their primary care physicians' (PCPs) notes report improved adherence to their regimens. However, objective confirmation has yet to be reported.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between patient Internet portal access to primary care physician visit notes and medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: This study is a retrospective comparative analysis at one site of the OpenNotes quasi-experimental trial. The setting includes primary care practices at the Geisinger Health System (GHS) in Danville, Pennsylvania. Participants include patients 18 years of age or older with electronic portal access, GHS primary care physicians, and Geisinger health plan insurance, and taking at least one antihypertensive or antihyperlipidemic agent from March 2009 to June 2011. Starting in March 2010, intervention patients were invited and reminded to read their PCPs' notes. Control patients also had Web portal access throughout, but their PCPs' notes were not available. From prescription claims, adherence was assessed by using the proportion of days covered (PDC). Patients with a PDC >.80 were considered adherent and were compared across groups using generalized linear models.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 2147 patients (756 intervention participants, 35.21%; 1391 controls, 64.79%) were included in the analysis. Compared to those without access, patients invited to review notes were more adherent to antihypertensive medications-adherence rate 79.7% for intervention versus 75.3% for control group; adjusted risk ratio, 1.06 (95% CI 1.00-1.12). Adherence was similar among patient groups taking antihyperlipidemic agents-adherence rate 77.6% for intervention versus 77.3% for control group; adjusted risk ratio, 1.01 (95% CI 0.95-1.07).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Availability of notes following PCP visits was associated with improved adherence by patients prescribed antihypertensive, but not antihyperlipidemic, medications. As the use of fully transparent records spreads, patients invited to read their clinicians' notes may modify their behaviors in clinically valuable ways.

TI  - The Impact of a Nurse-Led Home Visitation Program on Hypertension Self-Management among Older Community-Dwelling Koreans.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of a nurse-led home visitation program for hypertension self-management among older community-dwelling Koreans.
AB  - DESIGN AND SAMPLE: As part of a larger community-based home visitation project aimed at behavioral change in this vulnerable population, a single group pre- and posttest design was used.
AB  - MEASURES: Visiting nurses affiliated to public health center assisted vulnerable elders with hypertension self-management tailored according to their health problems through home visits for a period of 2-4 months.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 13,452 hypertensive persons over the age of 65 completed the intervention. All outcomes were significantly improved and included hypertension knowledge, blood pressure monitoring, dietary management, medication adherence, and self-confidence in hypertension self-management (p < .001). Changes in hypertension knowledge, medication adherence, and self-confidence varied by gender with women showing greater knowledge improvement than men but less improvement in medication adherence and confidence in hypertension self-management. There was a marginal interaction effect for gender and age on dietary management (F = 3.55, p = .063), with men (>75 years) showing greater improvement than their female counterparts after the intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This nurse-led home visitation intervention can be helpful in self-management skill building among hypertensive Korean elders. The program may improve medication adherence and health-promoting behavioral changes.Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Medication non-adherence after myocardial infarction: an exploration of modifying factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication non-adherence is a major impediment to the management of cardiovascular disease risk factors. A better understanding of the modifying factors underlying medication non-adherence among individuals with known cardiovascular disease may inform approaches for addressing non-adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify demographic and patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, psychosocial factors, and health belief-related factors associated with medication non-adherence among patients with known cardiovascular disease.
AB  - DESIGN: We performed secondary analysis of baseline data from a randomized trial.
AB  - PATIENTS: The study included 405 patients with a diagnosis of hypertension and history of acute myocardial infarction that was diagnosed within a three-year period prior to enrollment.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Baseline demographics and patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, psychosocial factors, health belief-related factors, and patient-reported medication non-adherence were analyzed.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Of 405 patients, 173 (42.7 %) reported medication non-adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence in bivariate analysis included younger age, non-white race, having less than 12 years of education, smoking, financial insecurity, identifying as nervous or tense, higher life chaos score, greater worry about having a myocardial infarction, and greater worry about having a stroke. Using multivariable modeling, we determined that age (OR 0.97 per additional year, 95 % CI, 0.95-0.99), life chaos (OR 1.06 per additional point, 95 % CI, 1.00-1.11), and worry about stroke (OR 1.12 per additional point, 95 % CI, 1.01-1.25) remained significantly associated with self-reported medication non-adherence.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We found that worry about having a stroke, higher life chaos, and younger age were all significantly associated with self-reported medication non-adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease and a history of myocardial infarction. Further research exploring these factors as targets for intervention is needed, as is additional research examining modifiable causes of medication non-adherence among patients with cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Determinants of adherence to treatment in hypertensive patients of African descent and the role of culturally appropriate education.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Western countries, better knowledge about patient-related determinants of treatment adherence (medication and lifestyle) is needed to improve treatment adherence and outcomes among hypertensive ethnic minority patients of African descent.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify patient-related determinants of adherence to lifestyle and medication recommendations among hypertensive African Surinamese and Ghanaian patients with suboptimal treatment results (SBP>140) living in the Netherlands and how culturally appropriate hypertension education (CAHE) influenced those determinants.
AB  - METHODS: This study analysed data of 139 patients who participated in the CAHE trial. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to measure the association between patient-related determinants (medication self-efficacy, beliefs about medication and hypertension, social support, and satisfaction with care) and treatment adherence. We also tested whether CAHE influenced the determinants.
AB  - RESULTS: Medication self-efficacy and social support were associated with medication adherence at baseline. At six months, more medication self-efficacy and fewer concerns about medication use were associated with improved medication adherence. Self-efficacy was also associated with adherence to lifestyle recommendations at baseline. CAHE influenced patients' illness perceptions by creating more understanding of hypertension, its chronic character, and more concerns about the associated risks.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In this high-risk population, health care providers can support medication adherence by paying attention to patients' medication self-efficacy, the concerns they may have about medication use and patients' perceptions on hypertension. The CAHE intervention improved patients' perception on hypertension.

TI  - Blood Pressure Control Has Improved in People with and without Type 2 Diabetes but Remains Suboptimal: A Longitudinal Study Based on the German DIAB-CORE Consortium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a very common comorbidity and major risk factor for cardiovascular complications, especially in people with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Nevertheless, studies in the past have shown that blood pressure is often insufficiently controlled in medical practice. For the DIAB-CARE study, we used longitudinal data based on the German DIAB-CORE Consortium to assess whether health care regarding hypertension has improved during the last decade in our participants.
AB  - METHODS: Data of the three regional population-based studies CARLA (baseline 2002-2006 and follow-up 2007-2010), KORA (baseline 1999-2001 and follow-up 2006-2008) and SHIP (baseline 1997-2001 and follow-up 2002-2006) were pooled. Stratified by T2D status we analysed changes in frequencies, degrees of awareness, treatment and control. Linear mixed models were conducted to assess the influence of sex, age, study, and T2D status on changes of systolic blood pressure between the baseline and follow-up examinations (mean observation time 5.7 years). We included 4,683 participants aged 45 to 74 years with complete data and accounted for 1,256 participants who were lost to follow-up by inverse probability weighting.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean systolic blood pressure decreased in all groups from baseline to follow-up (e.g. - 8.5 mmHg in those with incident T2D). Pulse pressure (PP) was markedly higher in persons with T2D than in persons without T2D (64.14 mmHg in prevalent T2D compared to 52.87 mmHg in non-T2D at baseline) and did not change much between the two examinations. Awareness, treatment and control increased considerably in all subgroups however, the percentage of those with insufficiently controlled hypertension remained high (at about 50% of those with hypertension) especially in prevalent T2D. Particularly elderly people with T2D often had both, high blood pressure >140/90 mmHg and a PP of >60 mmHg. Blood pressure in men had improved more than in women at follow-up, however, men still had higher mean SBP than women at follow-up.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Blood pressure management has developed positively during past years in Germany. While hypertension prevalence, awareness and treatment were substantially higher in participants with T2D than in those without T2D at follow-up, hypertension control was achieved only in about half the number of people in each T2D group leaving much room for further improvement.

TI  - A centralized cardiovascular risk service to improve guideline adherence in private primary care offices.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many large health systems now employ clinical pharmacists in team-based care to assist patients and physicians with management of cardiovascular (CV) diseases. However, small private offices often lack the resources to hire a clinical pharmacist for their office. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a centralized, web-based CV risk service (CVRS) managed by clinical pharmacists will improve guideline adherence in primary care medical offices in rural and small communities.
AB  - METHODS: This study is a cluster randomized prospective trial in 12 primary care offices. Medical offices were randomized to either the CVRS intervention or usual care. The intervention will last for 12 months and all subjects will have research visits at baseline and 12 months. Primary outcomes will include adherence to treatment guidelines and control of key CV risk factors. Data will also be abstracted from the medical record at 30 months to determine if the intervention effect is sustained after it is discontinued.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study will enroll subjects through 2015 and results will be available in 2018. This study will provide information on whether a distant, centralized CV risk service can improve guideline adherence in medical offices that lack the resources to employ clinical pharmacists.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Understanding Perceptions and Practices for Zambian Adults in Western Province at Risk for Hypertension: An Exploratory Descriptive Study.
AB  - Hypertension is an important public health issue in Zambia. Despite the need for early detection, treatment, and ongoing monitoring, there is little documented research on hypertension in Zambia. The study aims were to: 1) better understand risk factors for hypertension in urban and rural communities in Mongu and Limulunga Districts, Western Province; 2) identify current health practices for hypertension and prevention in these communities; and 3) explore intersections between culture and hypertension perceptions and practices for study participants. A mixed methods approach was used; 203 adults completed surveys including demographics, anthropometric measures, blood pressure (BP), physicial activity, diet, and salt intake at five health check stations. Two focus groups were conducted with rural and urban community members to better understand their perspectives on hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension was 32.8% for survey participants. A further 24.6% had pre-hypertension. The mean total weight of salt added to food was nearly double the WHO recommendation with women adding significantly more salt to food than men. Significant differences in waist circumference were observed between men and women with men at low risk and women at substantialy high risk. In focus groups, participants cited westernized diets, lack of physical activity, stress, psychological factors, and urbanization as causative factors for hypertension. Participants lacked understanding of BP medications, healthy lifestyles, adherence to treatment, and ongoing monitoring. Focus group participants mentioned challenges in obtaining treatment for hypertension and desired to be active contributors in creating solutions. They recommended that government priorize hypertension initiatives that increase access to health education to reduce risk, enhance early detection, and support lifestyle changes and medication adherence. Our findings suggest that policy-makers need to engage communities more effectively to develop successful public health strategies to prevent, detect, and manage hypertension in Western Province, Zambia, particularly in rural areas.

TI  - Monotherapy versus dual therapy for the initial treatment of hypertension (PATHWAY-1): a randomised double-blind controlled trial.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have suggested that more intensive initial therapy for hypertension results in better long-term blood pressure (BP) control. We test this hypothesis comparing initial monotherapy with dual therapy in the management of essential hypertension.
AB  - METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled trial in patients with essential hypertension. Around 50% of patients studied will be newly diagnosed and the others will be known hypertensives who previously received only monotherapy. The trial is divided into three phases as follows: Phase 1 (Week 0-Week 16): Randomised, parallel-group, masked assignation to either combination or monotherapy. Phase 2 (Week 17-Week 32): Open-label combination therapy. Phase 3 (Week 33-Week 52): Open-label combination therapy plus open-label add-on (if BP is above 140/90 mm Hg). Hierarchical primary end points are: a comparison of home BP (home systolic blood pressure (HSBP)) averaged over the duration of phase 1 and 2 in the combination versus monotherapy arms. If combination is superior in this analysis, then the averaged mean HSBP between initial monotherapy and initial combination therapy at the end of phase 2 will be compared. Secondary end points include: BP control at 1 year; the role of age, baseline renin, sodium status, plasma volume, haemodynamic compensation and peripheral resistance on BP control; validation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence/British Hypertension Society joint guideline algorithm; safety and tolerability of combination therapy; and the impact of combination versus monotherapy on left ventricular mass and aortic pulse wave velocity. A sample size of 536 (268 in each group) will have 90% power to detect a difference in means of 4 mm Hg.
AB  - ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: PATHWAY 1 was approved by UK ethics (REC Reference 09/H0308/132). Trial results will be published and all participating subjects will be informed of the results.

TI  - ADHERENCE TO THERAPY AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS.
AB  - This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the association between medication adherence and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in 120 hypertensive patients. Personal Information Form, SF-36 Quality of Life Scale (SF-36 QoL) and Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (MASES) were used for data collection. Data were analyzed with SPSS program using percentage, mean value, standard deviation, significance test of difference between two means, analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and X2-test. MASES and SF-36 QoL scores of the patients were found to be low. Adherence to medication and compliance were found to be low in males, patients using two or more drugs, and those that did not control their blood pressure regularly. In addition, a statistically significant positive relationship was found between adherence to medication/compliance, self-efficacy and quality of life (p < 0.001).

TI  - Pilot Study to Test the Effectiveness of Different Financial Incentives to Improve Medication Adherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence affects health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Concepts from behavioral economics can guide the development of interventions to improve medication adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the relative effectiveness of 2 behavioral economic-based incentive structures to improve medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial compared adherence among participants taking antihypertensive or antihyperlipidemic medications randomized to usual care (UC), guaranteed pay-out (GPO) incentives, or lottery incentives. Daily adherence was measured over a 90-day period using electronic caps (Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS]). The GPO group received $30 up-front in a virtual account, with $0.50 deducted for each missed dose. Lottery group participants were eligible for a weekly $50 drawing, but only if they had taken their medication as prescribed all week. An electronic survey assessed self-reported adherence. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, paired t tests, ANOVA, and Pearson's correlations.
AB  - RESULTS: In all, 36 participants were randomized (UC, n = 11; GPO, n = 14; lottery, n = 11). Mean percentage (+/-SD) of days adherent during the incentive period was highest in the lottery group (96% +/- 5%), followed by the GPO group (94% +/- 9%) and the UC group (94% +/- 9%). There were no statistically significant differences among groups (P > 0.05). MEMS-measured adherence was not significantly correlated with a patient's self-reported adherence (P > 0.05) at baseline but was correlated at 90-day follow-up (P < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistically significant differences in adherence were demonstrated in this small sample of highly adherent participants, larger studies in a more diverse population or with other medications might show otherwise.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

TI  - Performance and persistence of a blood pressure self-management intervention: telemonitoring and self-management in hypertension (TASMINH2) trial.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate, in detail, the implementation of the self-management intervention used in the TASMINH2 trial. The intervention, comprising self-monitoring for the first week of each month and an individualised treatment self-titration schedule, was developed from a previous trial of self-management. Two hundred and sixty-three patients with poorly controlled but treated hypertension were randomised to receive this intervention and underwent training over two or three sessions. Participants were followed up for 12 months during which time process data were collected regarding the persistence and fidelity of actual behaviour compared with intervention recommendations. Two hundred and forty-one (92%) patients completed training of whom 188 (72%) self-managed their BP and completed at least 90% of expected self-monitoring measurements for the full year of the study. Overall, 268/483 (55%) of recommended medication changes were implemented. Only 25 (13%) patients had controlled BP throughout the year and so were not recommended any medication changes. Adherence to the protocol reduced over time as the number of potential changes increased. Of those self-managing throughout, 131 (70%) made at least one medication change, with 77 (41%) implementing all their recommended changes. In conclusion, self-management of hypertension was possible in practice with most participants making at least one medication change. Although adherence to the intervention reduced over time, implementation of treatment recommendations appeared better than equivalent trials using physician titration. Future self-management interventions should aim to better support patients' decision making, perhaps through enhanced use of technology.

TI  - The SPYRAL HTN Global Clinical Trial Program: Rationale and design for studies of renal denervation in the absence (SPYRAL HTN OFF-MED) and presence (SPYRAL HTN ON-MED) of antihypertensive medications. [Review]
AB  - Renal sympathetic activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, as demonstrated by high renal norepinephrine spillover into plasma of patients with essential hypertension. Renal denervation has demonstrated a significant reduction in blood pressure in unblinded studies of hypertensive patients. The SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial, the first prospective, masked, randomized study of renal denervation versus sham control, failed its primary efficacy end point and raised important questions around potentially confounding factors, such as drug changes and adherence, study population, and procedural methods. The SPYRAL HTN Global Clinical Trial Program is designed to address limitations associated with predicate studies and provide insight into the impact of pharmacotherapy on renal denervation efficacy. The 2 initial trials of the program focus on the effect of renal denervation using the Symplicity Spyral multielectrode renal denervation catheter in hypertensive patients in the absence (SPYRAL HTN OFF-MED) and presence (SPYRAL HTN ON-MED) of antihypertensive medications. The SPYRAL HTN ON-MED study requires patients to be treated with a consistent triple therapy antihypertensive regimen, whereas the SPYRAL HTN OFF-MED study includes a 3- to 4-week drug washout period followed by a 3-month efficacy and safety end point in the absence of antihypertensive medications. The studies will randomize patients with combined systolic-diastolic hypertension to renal denervation or sham procedure. Both studies allow renal denervation treatments in renal artery branches and accessories. These studies will inform the design of the second pivotal phase of the program, which will more definitively analyze the antihypertensive effect of renal denervation. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Patient Cases: 1. A Patient with Apparent Compliance.
AB  - Compliance with antihypertensive therapy decreases over time and as the number of pills increases. This case describes a 64-year-old male with hypertension who was initially prescribed antihypertensive therapy with olmesartan (OLM) once daily in the morning and amlodipine (AML) once daily in the evening. Reductions in blood pressure (BP) were observed, but BP control was not achieved. Therefore, an evening dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was added to the treatment regimen. Despite stating that he was adhering to therapy, the patient's prescription records indicated otherwise. The patient was switched to an OLM/AML/HCTZ single-pill fixed-dose combination and BP had decreased to the normal range at a follow-up visit 3 months later.

TI  - [The evaluation of hypertensive patients who are supposedly under control according to office blood pressure measurements with ambulatuar blood pressure monitoring: an observational prospective study in three big cities (AKB3IL study)]. [Turkish]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to evaluate hypertensive patients who are supposedly under control according to office blood pressure measurements with 24 hour ambulatuar blood pressure monitoring for determining their actual controlled hypertension rate. In addition, we investigate the adherence ratio of blood pressure measurements to current guidelines.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Nine hundred-forty hypertensive patients supposedly under control according to office blood pressure measurements were enrolled in the study. Twenty-four hour ambulatuar blood pressure monitoring was performed on all of them.
AB  - RESULTS: Actual controlled hypertension was determined in 617 (65.6%) patients whereas 323 (34.4%) patients had uncontrolled hypertension. The blood pressure measurements that were over threshold values were seen mostly at night and in the early morning during ambulatuar blood pressure monitoring. Nocturnal and early morning hypertension was determined in most of the patients who were supposedly under control according to office blood pressure measurements. This was especially true in patients with high cardiovascular risk such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney failure, and metabolic syndrome.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Efficacy of antihypertensive therapy during 24 hour and the early morning period is essential for optimal risk modification.

TI  - Pharmacist intervention for blood pressure control: medication intensification and adherence.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe medication adherence and medication intensification in a physician-pharmacist collaborative management (PPCM) model compared with usual care. This study was a prospective, cluster, randomized study in 32 primary care offices from 15 states. The primary outcomes were medication adherence and anti-hypertensive medication changes during the first 9 months of the intervention. The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients, 345 of which received the intervention. There was no significant difference between intervention and usual care patients in regards to medication adherence at 9 months. Intervention patients received significantly more medication changes (4.9 vs.1.1; P = .0003) and had significantly increased use of diuretics and aldosterone antagonists when compared with usual care (P = .01).The PPCM model increased medication intensification; however, no significant change in medication adherence was detected. PPCM models will need to develop non-adherence identification and intervention methods to further improve the potency of the care team. Copyright © 2015 American Society of Hypertension.

TI  - An observational study of hypertension treatment and patient outcomes in a primary care setting.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Evaluation and treatment of high blood pressure are vital to reducing hypertension-related morbidity. There are limited data on treatment of hypertension in Lesotho. The aim of this study was to investigate hypertension treatment and control in a primary care setting in Lesotho.
AB  - METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among hypertensive patients treated at Domiciliary Health Clinic in Maseru, Lesotho between April and May 2013. We reviewed medical records and evaluated hypertension treatment and blood pressure control in the past 12 months. Patients were interviewed to assess adherence to hypertension treatment. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with poor blood pressure control.
AB  - RESULTS: 70 patients were enrolled in the study; 90.0% were female, the mean age was 57.7 years, 80.0% were overweight/obese and 27.1% had diabetes mellitus. 90.0% of the patients received combination antihypertensive therapy; the most frequently prescribed drugs were hydrochlorothiazide (90.0%), captopril (67.1%) and atenolol (51.4%). The majority of the patients had chronic uncontrolled hypertension. 67.2% of the patients had continuous access to antihypertensive drugs in the past 12 months; adherence to medication, diet and exercise was 64.3%, 37.1% and 7.1% respectively. Age >65 was the strongest independent predictor of poor blood pressure control (AOR = 10.3, 95% CI: 1.21-88.98, p = 0.033).
AB  - CONCLUSION: There is a need for interventions to improve hypertension care and outcomes in this setting. Efforts should be made to improve assessment of hypertensive patients, optimise antihypertensive therapy and promote patient adherence to treatment.

TI  - A practice-based randomized controlled trial to improve medication adherence among Latinos with hypertension: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Latinos experience disproportionately higher rates of uncontrolled hypertension as compared to Blacks and Whites. While poor adherence is a major contributor to disparities in blood pressure control, data in Latino patients are scant. More importantly, translation of interventions to improve medication adherence in community-based primary care practices, where the majority of Latino patients receive their care is non-existent.
AB  - METHODS: Using a randomized controlled design, this study evaluates the effectiveness of a culturally tailored, practice-based intervention compared to usual care on medication adherence, among 148 Latino patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are non-adherent to their antihypertensive medications. Bilingual medical assistants trained as Health Coaches deliver the intervention using an electronic medical record system-embedded adherence script. Patients randomized to the intervention group receive patient-centered counseling with a Health Coach to develop individualized self-monitoring strategies to overcome barriers and improve adherence behaviors. Health Coach sessions are held biweekly for the first 3 months (6 sessions total) and then monthly for the remaining 3 months (3 sessions total). Patients randomized to the usual care group receive standard hypertension treatment recommendations as determined by their primary care providers. The primary outcome is the rate of medication adherence at 6 months. The secondary outcome is reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 6 months.
AB  - DISCUSSION: If successful, findings from this study will provide salient information on the translation of culturally tailored, evidence-based interventions targeted at medication adherence and blood pressure control into practice-based settings for this high-risk population.

TI  - Hyperresponders vs. nonresponder patients after renal denervation: do they differ?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood pressure (BP) response after renal denervation (RDN) is highly variable. Besides baseline BP, no reliable predictors of response have been consistently identified. The differences between patients showing a major BP decrease after RDN vs. nonresponders have not been studied so far.
AB  - AIM AND METHODS: We identified extreme BP responders (first quintile) and nonresponders (fifth quintile) to RDN defined according to office or 24-h ambulatory BP in the European Network COordinating research on Renal Denervation database (n = 109) and compared the baseline characteristics and BP changes 6 months after RDN in both subsets.
AB  - RESULTS: In extreme responders defined according to ambulatory BP, baseline BP and BP changes 6 months after RDN were similar for office and out-of-the office BP. In contrast, extreme responders defined according to office BP were characterized by a huge white-coat effect at baseline, with dramatic shrinkage at 6 months. Compared with nonresponders, extreme responders defined according to office BP were more frequently women, had higher baseline office--but not ambulatory--BP, and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In contrast, when considering ambulatory BP decrease to define extreme responders and nonresponders, the single relevant difference between both subsets was baseline ambulatory BP.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This study suggests a major overestimation of BP response after RDN in extreme responders defined according to office, but not ambulatory BP. The association of lower eGFR with poor response to RDN is consistent with our previous analysis. The increased proportion of women in extreme responders may reflect sex differences in drug adherence.

TI  - Preparing pharmacists to deliver a targeted service in hypertension management: evaluation of an interprofessional training program.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to medicines by patients and suboptimal prescribing by clinicians underpin poor blood pressure (BP) control in hypertension. In this study, a training program was designed to enable community pharmacists to deliver a service in hypertension management targeting therapeutic adjustments and medication adherence. A comprehensive evaluation of the training program was undertaken.
AB  - METHODS: Tailored training comprising a self-directed pre-work manual, practical workshop (using real patients), and practice scenarios, was developed and delivered by an inter-professional team (pharmacists, GPs). Supported by practical and written assessment, the training focused on the principles of BP management, BP measurement skills, and adherence strategies. Pharmacists' experience of the training (expectations, content, format, relevance) was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. Immediate feedback was obtained via a questionnaire comprising Likert scales (1 ="very well" to 7 ="poor") and open-ended questions. Further in-depth qualitative evaluation was undertaken via semi-structured interviews several months post-training (and post service implementation).
AB  - RESULTS: Seventeen pharmacists were recruited, trained and assessed as competent. All were highly satisfied with the training; other than the 'amount of information provided' (median score = 5, "just right"), all aspects of training attained the most positive score of '1'. Pharmacists most valued the integrated team-based approach, GP involvement, and inclusion of real patients, as well as the pre-reading manual, BP measurement workshop, and case studies (simulation). Post-implementation the interviews highlighted that comprehensive training increased pharmacists' confidence in providing the service, however, training of other pharmacy staff and patient recruitment strategies were highlighted as a need in future.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Structured, multi-modal training involving simulated and inter-professional learning is effective in preparing selected community pharmacists for the implementation of new services in the context of hypertension management. This training could be further enhanced to prepare pharmacists for the challenges encountered in implementing and evaluating services in practice.

TI  - Perceptions of inhibitors and facilitators for adhering to hypertension treatment among insured patients in rural Nigeria: a qualitative study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Universal health care coverage has been identified as a promising strategy for improving hypertension treatment and control rates in sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Yet, even when quality care is accessible, poor adherence can compromise treatment outcomes. To provide information for adherence support interventions, this study explored what low income patients who received hypertension care in the context of a community based health insurance program in Nigeria perceive as inhibitors and facilitators for adhering to pharmacotherapy and healthy behaviors.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a qualitative interview study with 40 insured hypertensive patients who had received hypertension care for>1 year in a rural primary care hospital in Kwara state, Nigeria. Supported by MAXQDA software, interview transcripts were inductively coded. Codes were then grouped into concepts and thematic categories, leading to matrices for inhibitors and facilitators of treatment adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Important patient-identified facilitators of medication adherence included: affordability of care (through health insurance); trust in orthodox "western" medicines; trust in Doctor; dreaded dangers of hypertension; and use of prayer to support efficacy of pills. Inhibitors of medication adherence included: inconvenient clinic operating hours; long waiting times; under-dispensing of prescriptions; side-effects of pills; faith motivated changes of medication regimen; herbal supplementation/substitution of pills; and ignorance that regular use is needed. Local practices and norms were identified as important inhibitors to the uptake of healthier behaviors (e.g. use of salt for food preservation; negative cultural images associated with decreased body size and physical activity). Important factors facilitating such behaviors were the awareness that salt substitutes and products for composing healthier meals were cheaply available at local markets and that exercise could be integrated in people's daily activities (e.g. farming, yam pounding, and household chores).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: With a better understanding of patient perceived inhibitors and facilitators of adherence to hypertension treatment, this study provides information for patient education and health system level interventions that can be designed to improve compliance.

TI  - Improving Medication Adherence in Patients with Hypertension: A Randomized Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In patients with hypertension, medication adherence is often suboptimal, thereby increasing the risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke. In a randomized trial, we investigated the effectiveness of a multifaceted pharmacist intervention in a hospital setting to improve medication adherence in hypertensive patients. Motivational interviewing was a key element of the intervention.
AB  - METHODS: Patients (n = 532) were recruited from 3 hospital outpatient clinics and randomized to usual care or a 6-month pharmacist intervention comprising collaborative care, medication review, and tailored adherence counseling including motivational interviewing and telephone follow-ups. The primary outcome was composite medication possession ratio (MPR) to antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents, at 1-year follow-up, assessed by analyzing pharmacy records. Secondary outcomes at 12 months included persistence to medications, blood pressure, hospital admission, and a combined clinical endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, or acute myocardial infarction.
AB  - RESULTS: At 12 months, 20.3% of the patients in the intervention group (n = 231) were nonadherent (MPR <0.80), compared with 30.2% in the control group (n = 285) (risk difference -9.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.3, -2.4) and median MPR (interquartile range) was 0.93 (0.82-0.99) and 0.91 (0.76-0.98), respectively, P = .02. The combined clinical endpoint was reached by 1.3% in the intervention group and 3.1% in the control group (relative risk 0.41; 95% CI, 0.11-1.50). No significant differences were found for persistence, blood pressure, or hospital admission.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted pharmacist intervention in a hospital setting led to a sustained improvement in medication adherence for patients with hypertension. The intervention had no significant impact on blood pressure and secondary clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pharmacist-provided diabetes management and education via a telemonitoring program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes (glycosylated hemoglobin [A1C], blood pressure, and lipids) and other measurements (disease state knowledge, adherence, and self-efficacy) associated with the use of approved telemonitoring devices to expand and improve chronic disease management of patients with diabetes, with or without hypertension.
AB  - SETTING: Four community health centers (CHCs) in Utah.
AB  - PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Federally qualified safety net clinics that provide medical care to underserved patients.
AB  - PRACTICE INNOVATION: Pharmacist-led diabetes management using telemonitoring was compared with a group of patients receiving usual care (without telemonitoring).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Daily blood glucose (BG) and blood pressure (BP) values were reviewed and the pharmacist provided phone follow-up to assess and manage out-of-range BG and BP values.
AB  - EVALUATION: Changes in A1C, BP, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) at approximately 6 months were compared between the telemonitoring group and the usual care group. Patient activation, diabetes/hypertension knowledge, and medication adherence were measured in the telemonitoring group.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 150 patients, 75 received pharmacist-provided diabetes management and education via telemonitoring, and 75 received usual medical care. Change in A1C was significantly greater in the telemonitoring group compared with the usual care group (2.07% decrease vs. 0.66% decrease; P <0.001). Although BP and LDL levels also declined, differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. Patient activation measure, diabetes/hypertension knowledge, and medication adherence with antihypertensives (but not diabetes medications) improved in the telemonitoring group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-provided diabetes management via telemonitoring resulted in a significant improvement in A1C in federally qualified CHCs in Utah compared with usual medical care. Telemonitoring may be considered a model for providing clinical pharmacy services to patients with diabetes.

TI  - [PRAdA intervention: effects on weight of dietary intervention among treated hypertensive Portuguese natives and African immigrants]. [Portuguese]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Blood pressure is significantly improved with weight loss. Behavioral interventions for weight loss seem to be less successful in African immigrants. Our main aims were to assess the effect of a dietary and lifestyle intervention on weight among hypertensive Portuguese natives and immigrants and to identify success factors for weight loss, and also to evaluate changes in knowledge and compliance with food recommendations.
AB  - MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hypertensive medicated patients followed in primary care setting were randomly enrolled in a two phase study, observational (15-months) and behavioral intervention (six months). Participants were divided in two groups: immigrants from African Countries of Portuguese Official Language and Portuguese natives. Participants were given dietary and life styles recommendations in individual face-to-face and telephone sessions.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 110 participants with a mean BMI of 31.6 +/- 3.7 Kg/m(2), 60 were immigrants. The number of dietary recommendations known and followed at the end was significantly greater than at baseline; however natives performed a greater number of recommendations. Weight loss during intervention was in average 1.4 +/- 2.7% in natives and 0.8 +/- 3.6% in immigrants and was greater than in the observational period. Being male and consuming more than 2 servings of low-fat dairy products/day was associated with higher weight loss, independently of age and ethnicity.
AB  - DISCUSSION: In general the proposed intervention was efficacious especially in Portuguese natives, confirming other studies.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention increased knowledge and adherence to recommendations, highlighting the relevance of nutrition education, culturally adapted in primary care.

TI  - Training in ChiRunning to reduce blood pressure: a randomized controlled pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: People with prehypertension (120-130/80-90 mmHg) are at increased risk of progressing to hypertension. Recommendations for prehypertension include engaging in regular physical activity. We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure. ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi, which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form.
AB  - METHODS: We enrolled adults with elevated systolic (130-150 mmHg) or diastolic (80-100 mmHg) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial. Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of: 1) intervention-a trainer-led ChiRunning group (n=10); 2) active control-a trainer-led running group (n=6); or 3) educational control-a self-directed running group (n=6) and followed for 4 more weeks. The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: This study was feasible, meeting recruitment, retention and adherence goals, and acceptable to participants. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups. Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group (p=0.04) but not in the control group (slope for ChiRunning -0.05 [-0.1 to -0.002] vs. control -0.01 [-0.06 to 0.04], between slope difference, p=0.22). Self-reported running-related injury (i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running) was similar between groups (ChiRunning, 4 [1.2 to 8.4] vs. control, 3 [0.7 to 7.1] injuries per 100 h of running, p=0.72) although self-reported running-related discomfort (i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running) trended higher in the ChiRunning group (ChiRunning, 10 [5.4 to 16.8] vs. control, 4 [1.5 to 9] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running, p=0.06).
AB  - CONCLUSION: ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure. We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury, but did see a positive change in BMI over time. ChiRunning warrants further investigation in a larger trial.

TI  - [Ramipril plus amlodipine and lisinopril plus amlodipine fixed dose combinations and patient's adherence]. [Hungarian]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patient's adherence has a great significance to reach target blood pressure values. The risk of cardiovascular adverse events decreases when patients are on target blood pressure.
AB  - AIM: The aim of the authors was to investigate the one-year persistence of the ramipril/amlodipine and lisinopril/amlodipine fixed dose combination in hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHOD: National Health Insurance Found prescriptions database of Hungary on pharmacy-claims between October 1, 2012 and September 30, 2013 was analyzed. The authors identified patients who filled prescriptions for fixed dose combinations of ramipril and amlodipine, and lisinopril and amlodipine prescribed for the first time, for the therapeutic indication of hypertension. Patients have not received antihypertensive therapy with similar active substances during one year before the study. To model the persistence, the apparatus of survival analysis was used, where "survival" was the time to abandon the medication. As it was available to month precision, discrete time survival analysis was applied: a generalized linear model was estimated with complementary log-log link function with the kind of drug being the only explanatory variable.
AB  - RESULTS: During the study period, fixed dose combination antihypertensive therapy with ramipril plus amlodipine and lisinopril plus amlodipine was started in 10,449 and 20,276 patients, respectively. One-year persistence rate in patients taking ramipril and amlodipine as a fixed dose combination was 54%, whereas 36% in those on the fixed lisinopril and amlodipine combination. Considering only the 360-day study period, the mean duration of persistence was 271 days in patients on the ramipril based and 211 days on lisinopril based fixed dose combination. Analyzing persistence on treatment with these combinations showed that the actual rate of discontinuation was about twice higher during treatment with the lisinopril and amlodipine fixed dose combination compared with the use of the ramipril and amlodipine fixed dose combination (hazard ratio = 1.79, p<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant difference between the one-year persistence of ramipril plus amlodipine and lisinopril plus amlodipine fixed dose combination in patients with hypertension. The result demonstrated that ramipril and amlodipine fixed dose combination has a favourable patients' adherence as compared to lisinopril and amlodipine fixed dose combination.

TI  - The Cost-Effectiveness of Low-Cost Essential Antihypertensive Medicines for Hypertension Control in China: A Modelling Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is China's leading cardiovascular disease risk factor. Improved hypertension control in China would result in result in enormous health gains in the world's largest population. A computer simulation model projected the cost-effectiveness of hypertension treatment in Chinese adults, assuming a range of essential medicines list drug costs.
AB  - METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-China, a Markov-style computer simulation model, simulated hypertension screening, essential medicines program implementation, hypertension control program administration, drug treatment and monitoring costs, disease-related costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by preventing cardiovascular disease or lost because of drug side effects in untreated hypertensive adults aged 35-84 y over 2015-2025. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in cardiovascular disease patients (secondary prevention) and for two blood pressure ranges in primary prevention (stage one, 140-159/90-99 mm Hg; stage two, >160/>100 mm Hg). Treatment of isolated systolic hypertension and combined systolic and diastolic hypertension were modeled as a reduction in systolic blood pressure; treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension was modeled as a reduction in diastolic blood pressure. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored ranges of antihypertensive drug effectiveness and costs, monitoring frequency, medication adherence, side effect severity, background hypertension prevalence, antihypertensive medication treatment, case fatality, incidence and prevalence, and cardiovascular disease treatment costs. Median antihypertensive costs from Shanghai and Yunnan province were entered into the model in order to estimate the effects of very low and high drug prices. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than the per capita gross domestic product of China (11,900 international dollars [Int$] in 2015) were considered cost-effective. Treating hypertensive adults with prior cardiovascular disease for secondary prevention was projected to be cost saving in the main simulation and 100% of probabilistic simulation results. Treating all hypertension for primary and secondary prevention would prevent about 800,000 cardiovascular disease events annually (95% uncertainty interval, 0.6 to 1.0 million) and was borderline cost-effective incremental to treating only cardiovascular disease and stage two patients (2015 Int$13,000 per QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval, Int$10,000 to Int$18,000]). Of all one-way sensitivity analyses, assuming adherence to taking medications as low as 25%, high Shanghai drug costs, or low medication efficacy led to the most unfavorable results (treating all hypertension, about Int$47,000, Int$37,000, and Int$27,000 per QALY were gained, respectively). The strengths of this study were the use of a recent Chinese national health survey, vital statistics, health care costs, and cohort study outcomes data as model inputs and reliance on clinical-trial-based estimates of coronary heart disease and stroke risk reduction due to antihypertensive medication treatment. The limitations of the study were the use of several sources of data, limited clinical trial evidence for medication effectiveness and harms in the youngest and oldest age groups, lack of information about geographic and ethnic subgroups, lack of specific information about indirect costs borne by patients, and uncertainty about the future epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases in China.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Expanded hypertension treatment has the potential to prevent about 800,000 cardiovascular disease events annually and be borderline cost-effective in China, provided low-cost essential antihypertensive medicines programs can be implemented.

TI  - Improving adherence in African American women with uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: African American women are disproportionately affected with hypertension (HTN). The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-week culturally tailored educational intervention for 60 African American women with HTN.
AB  - METHODS: Sixty African American women, 29 to 86 years old (mean +/- SD, 57.98 +/- 12.37 years), with primary HTN were recruited from 4 rural locations and randomized to intervention (n = 30) and control (n = 30) groups to determine the effectiveness of the intervention on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, social support, adherence to an HTN regimen, and blood pressure control. Culturally tailored educational classes were provided for 90 minutes once a week for 6 weeks. The control group received usual care.
AB  - RESULTS: A significant favorable overall main effect (time) was found for systolic blood pressure (F3,174 = 11.104, P = .000) and diastolic blood pressure (F3,174 = 4.781, P = .003) for both groups. Also for diastolic blood pressure, older age was a significant covariate (F1,56 = 6.798, P = .012). Older participants tended to have increased diastolic blood pressures. There were no significant differences between groups on knowledge, adherence, or attitudes.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The culturally tailored program used the African American church as a basis for recruitment and implementation of the program that retained all participants over a 6-month period. African American women living in rural Texas who participated in a 6-week intervention program demonstrated a significant decrease in blood pressure over a 6-month period regardless of whether they were in the intervention or control group. In general, they had a relatively good knowledge of HTN and reported an average level of adherence. Future studies using a culturally tailored program with a larger sample size are warranted to decrease the high level of HTN-related complications in African American women.

TI  - Improving treatment adherence for blood pressure lowering via mobile phone SMS-messages in South Africa: a qualitative evaluation of the SMS-text Adherence SuppoRt (StAR) trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective use of proven treatments for high blood pressure, a preventable health risk, is challenging for many patients. Prompts via mobile phone SMS-text messaging may improve adherence to clinic visits and treatment, though more research is needed on impact and patient perceptions of such support interventions, especially in low-resource settings.
AB  - METHOD: An individually-randomised controlled trial in a primary care clinic in Cape Town (2012-14), tested the effect of an adherence support intervention delivered via SMS-texts, on blood pressure control and adherence to medication, for hypertensive patients. (
AB  - TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019823). We report on a qualitative evaluation that explored the trial participants' experiences and responses to the SMS-text messages, and identified barriers and facilitators to delivering adherence support via patients' own mobile phones. Two focus groups and fifteen individual interviews were conducted. We used comparative and thematic analysis approaches to identify themes and triangulated our analysis amongst three researchers.
AB  - RESULTS: Most participants were comfortable with the technology of using SMS-text messages. Messages were experienced as acceptable, relevant and useful to a broad range of participants. The SMS-content, the respectful tone and the delivery (timing of reminders and frequency) and the relational aspect of trial participation (feeling cared for) were all highly valued. A subgroup who benefitted the most, were those who had been struggling with adherence due to high levels of personal stress. The intervention appeared to coincide with their readiness for change, and provided practical and emotional support for improving adherence behaviour. Change may have been facilitated through increased acknowledgement of their health status and attitudinal change towards greater self-responsibility. Complex interaction of psycho-social stressors and health service problems were reported as broader challenges to adherence behaviours.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Adherence support for treatment of raised blood pressure, delivered via SMS-text message on the patient's own phone, was found to be acceptable, relevant and helpful, even for those who already had their own reminder systems in place. Our findings begin to identify for whom and what core elements of the SMS-text message intervention appear to work best in a low-resource operational setting, issues that future research should explore in greater depth.

TI  - Patient response to insurer-led intervention for medication adherence - a pilot study based on claims data in Korea.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate patient responses to a medication counseling intervention program piloted by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), the national health insurer in Korea, to improve medication management in patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes.
AB  - METHODS AND MATERIALS: Interventions were conducted from July to September 2013 through direct mailing followed by two telephone-initiated counseling sessions for the medication discontinuation group (< 80% medication possession ratio (MPR) and > 2 months of discontinuation) and the medication over-possession group (> 150% MPR). The telephone intervention was applied through two models: model 1 (counseling by NHIS staff only) and model 2 (counseling by NHIS staff with contract-based working pharmacists in community pharmacies). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors affecting favorable responses of patients to the telephone-initiated intervention. Patient responses to the telephone-initiated intervention were evaluated by a counselor.
AB  - RESULTS: In all, 891 patients were counseledvia telephone. Patient responses to the telephone-initiated intervention were favorablein 57.6%, neutral in 17.4% and not favorable in 24.9% overall. Counseling by NHIS staff together with pharmacists (model 2) produced more favorable responses from patients than counseling by NHIS staff alone (model 1) (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.97 - 3.77).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our findings of favorable responses to interventions support a personalized approach by the NHIS to improve patient behavior for medication adherence.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of fixed-combination brinzolamide/timolol in Latin American patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension previously on brimonidine/timolol fixed combination.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fixed-combination glaucoma medications are commonly used to achieve target intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction in patients uncontrolled with monotherapy; however, ocular discomfort associated with eye drops can decrease adherence. This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of twice-daily fixed-combination brinzolamide 1%/timolol 0.5% (BRINZ/TIM-FC) in Latin American patients transitioned from fixed-combination brimonidine 0.2%/timolol 0.5% (BRIM/TIM-FC) because of insufficient IOP control or treatment intolerance.
AB  - METHODS: This 8-week, open-label, prospective study was conducted at six sites in Argentina, Chile, and Mexico. Enrolled patients were aged >18 years with open-angle glaucoma (including primary, exfoliative, or pigment-dispersion glaucoma) or ocular hypertension with IOP of 19-35 mmHg in >1 eye at baseline (on BRIM/TIM-FC). Patients self-administered BRINZ/TIM-FC to both eyes at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. daily for 8 weeks. The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were mean IOP change from baseline at week 8 and percentage of patients achieving target IOP (<18 mmHg) at week 8, respectively. Exploratory endpoints included patient and investigator preference for treatment at week 8. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed as the safety endpoint.
AB  - RESULTS: Fifty patients (mean +/- SD age, 66.7 +/- 11.5 years) received BRINZ/TIM-FC, and 49 were included in the intent-to-treat population. Mean +/- SD IOP was significantly reduced from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment with BRINZ/TIM-FC (-3.6 +/- 3.0 mmHg; P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; 17.1% reduction). Overall, 55.3% of patients achieved IOP <18 mmHg at week 8. Significantly more patients (89.4%) and investigators (95.7%) preferred BRINZ/TIM-FC to BRIM/TIM-FC (both P < 0.0001, exact binomial test). Of the 13 AEs observed, 8 were related to BRINZ/TIM-FC; the most common treatment-related AEs were eye irritation (n = 4) and abnormal sensation in the eye (n = 2).
AB  - CONCLUSION: BRINZ/TIM-FC provides an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients transitioned from BRIM/TIM-FC.

TI  - Blood pressure control and satisfaction of hypertensive patients following a switch to combined drugs of an angiotensin receptor blocker and a calcium channel blocker in clinical practice of nephrology.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination drugs containing an angiotensin receptor blocker and a calcium channel blocker have been widely commercialized in recent years, and their advantages, such as improvements in adherence, and reductions in medication costs, have been greatly emphasized. However, the actual situations and the impact of switching to combination drugs in clinical practice of nephrology are not fully understood.
AB  - METHODS: This study was conducted in outpatients of nephrology who received antihypertensive medicines, and who switched to combination drugs. Changes in the potency of the antihypertensive drugs, and blood pressure were examined retrospectively before and after changing treatments. In addition, the study also involved patients' questionnaire, which examined changes in blood pressure at home, the presence or absence of missed doses, the impact on medication-related expenses, and the level of patients' satisfaction with regard to combination drugs.
AB  - RESULTS: Survey results from 90 participants revealed that changing to combination drugs resulted in a reduction of missed doses, a decrease in blood pressure measured in an outpatient setting, and a reduction in medication-related expenses in total patients, non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, and CKD patients.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our study shows that switching to combination antihypertensive drugs resulted in an improvement in adherence and a reduction in medication-related expenses, and revealed that patient satisfaction was high. Combination drugs for hypertensive patients may be beneficial in both medical and economical viewpoints.

TI  - Health Behaviors of Korean Gastric Cancer Survivors with Hypertension: A Propensity Analysis of KNHANES III-V (2005-2012).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study provides a comparison of health behaviors between gastric cancer survivors with hypertension and non-cancer subjects in Korea.
AB  - METHODS: Data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) for the period of 2005-2012 were used in this study. A propensity score matching method was used to compare health behaviors. Before the matching of propensity scores, the number of participants was 11034 (102 gastric cancer survivors and 10932 non-cancer participants). A 1:5 propensity score matching procedure yielded a total of 480 participants (80 gastric cancer survivors and 400 non-cancer participants) for the final analysis. Drinking, smoking, physical activity, antihypertensive medication adherence, self-reported diet control, and sodium intake accordance in the two groups were compared. A complex samples logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess any differences between the two groups.
AB  - RESULTS: The group of hypertensive gastric cancer survivors had lower alcohol consumption (OR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.14-0.66; p-value = 0.003). They were more likely to be on dietary control than the control group (OR = 3.12; 95% CI: 1.60-6.10; p-value = 0.001). However, there was no significant (p > 0.05) difference in sodium intake accordance or other health behaviors (including medication adherence, smoking, and physical activity) between the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that gastric cancer survivors with hypertension were more likely to be on dietary control with lower alcohol consumption than the control group. However, there was no significant difference in sodium intake accordance or other health behaviors between the two groups. Therefore, primary care physicians should inform cancer survivors about the appropriate health behaviors to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease and improve their overall survival rate, even though they say they have been doing health behaviors.

TI  - A pragmatic randomized trial of a polypill-based strategy to improve use of indicated preventive treatments in people at high cardiovascular disease risk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most individuals at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk worldwide do not receive any or optimal preventive drugs. We aimed to determine whether fixed dose combinations of generic drugs ('polypills') would promote use of such medications.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label trial involving 623 participants from Australian general practices. Participants had established CVD or an estimated five-year CVD risk of >15%, with indications for antiplatelet, statin and >2 blood pressure lowering drugs ('combination treatment'). Participants randomized to the 'polypill-based strategy' received a polypill containing aspirin 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, lisinopril 10mg and either atenolol 50mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg. Participants randomized to 'usual care' continued with separate medications and doses as prescribed by their doctor. Primary outcomes were self-reported combination treatment use, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol.
AB  - RESULTS: After a median of 18 months, the polypill-based strategy was associated with greater use of combination treatment (70% vs. 47%; relative risk 1.49, (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30 to 1.72) p<0.0001; number needed to treat=4.4 (3.3 to 6.6)) without differences in systolic blood pressure (-1.5mmHg (95% CI -4.0 to 1.0) p=0.24) or total cholesterol (0.08mmol/l (95% CI -0.06 to 0.22) p=0.26). At study end, 17% and 67% of participants in polypill and usual care groups, respectively, were taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Provision of a polypill improved self-reported use of indicated preventive treatments. The lack of differences in blood pressure and cholesterol may reflect limited study power, although for cholesterol, improved statin use in the polypill group counter-balanced use of more potent statins with usual care.Copyright © The European Society of Cardiology 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

TI  - The FAITH Trial: Baseline Characteristics of a Church-based Trial to Improve Blood Pressure Control in Blacks.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the baseline characteristics of participants in the Faith-based Approaches in the Treatment of Hypertension (FAITH) Trial.
AB  - DESIGN: FAITH evaluates the effectiveness of a faith-based lifestyle intervention vs health education control on blood pressure (BP) reduction among hypertensive Black adults.
AB  - SETTING PARTICIPANTS AND MAIN MEASURES: Participants included 373 members of 32 Black churches in New York City. Baseline data collected included participant demographic characteristics, clinical measures (eg, blood pressure), behaviors (eg, diet, physical activity), and psychosocial factors (eg, self-efficacy, depressive symptoms).
AB  - RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 63.4 +/- 11.9 years and 76% were female. About half completed at least some college (53%), 66% had an income >$20,000, and 42.2% were retired or on disability. Participants had a mean systolic and diastolic BP of 152.1 +/- 16.8 mm Hg and 86.2 +/- 12.2 mm Hg, respectively, and a mean BMI of 32 kg/m2. Hypertension (HTN) medications were taken by 95% of participants, but most (79.1%) reported non-adherence to their regimen. Participants reported consuming 3.4 +/- 2.6 servings of fruits and vegetables and received 30.9% of their energy from fat. About one-third (35.9%) reported a low activity level.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the FAITH trial exhibited several adverse clinical and behavioral characteristics at baseline. Future analyses will evaluate the effectiveness of the faith-based lifestyle intervention on changes in BP and lifestyle behaviors among hypertensive Black adults.

TI  - Patient-reported medication adherence barriers among patients with cardiovascular risk factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients experience barriers that make it difficult to take cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related medications as prescribed. The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) was a tailored behavioral pharmacist-administered and telephone-based intervention for reducing CVD risk.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To (a) describe patient-reported barriers to taking their medication as prescribed and (b) evaluate patient-level characteristics associated with reporting medication barriers.
AB  - METHODS: We recruited patients receiving care at primary care clinics affiliated with Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Eligible patients were diagnosed with hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia that were poorly controlled (blood pressure of > 150/100 mmHg and/or low-density lipoprotein value > 130 mg/dL). At the time of enrollment, patients completed an interview with 7 questions derived from a validated medication barriers measure. Patient characteristics and individual medication treatment barriers are described. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the association between a medication barrier score and patient characteristics.
AB  - RESULTS: Most patients (n = 428) were married or living with their partners (57%) and were men (85%) who were diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia (64%). The most commonly reported barriers were having too much medication to take (31%) and forgetting whether medication was taken at a particular time (24%). In adjusted analysis, those who were not employed (1.32, 95% CI = 0.50-2.14) or did not have someone to help with tasks, if needed (1.66, 95% CI = 0.42-2.89), reported higher medication barrier scores. Compared with those diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, those with only hypertension (0.91, 95% CI = 0.04-1.79) reported higher medication barrier scores.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to medication adherence are common. Evaluating and addressing barriers may increase medication adherence.

TI  - [Lifestyle modifications]. [Japanese]
AB  - Lifestyle modifications are important in the prevention and treatment of hypertension. The Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH2014) recommend salt reduction (< 6 g/day), increased intake of vegetables/fruit and fish (fish oil), reduced intake of cholesterol and saturated fatty acids, weight loss (body mass index < 25kg/m2), exercise (> 30 min/day), reduction of alcohol intake (< 20-30 mL/day in men, < 10-20 mL/day in women as ethanol), and quitting smoking. These lifestyle modifications are capable of reducing blood pressure and ameliorating other cardiovascular risk factors. However, the reduction in blood pressure is mild to moderate and the adherence to lifestyle modifications has been still suboptimal.

TI  - Metering Self-Reported Adherence to Clinical Outcomes in Malaysian Patients With Hypertension: Applying the Stages of Change Model to Healthful Behaviors in the CORFIS Study.
AB  - The CORFIS (Community-Based Cardiovascular Risk Factors Intervention Strategies) program was piloted in community clinics in Malaysia to address the lack of health education in chronic disease management. The stages of change model was applied in a multicenter quasi-experimental design to evaluate adherence to advocated behaviors in CORFIS patients with hypertension. Based on submitted diet and exercise records (n = 209), adherence to sodium reduction, regular exercise, and increasing fruit and vegetable intake behaviors were quantified against weight, waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) changes. Patients were categorized at 6 months into nonadherent/N-A (Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Preparation), newly adherent/NA (Action) and totally adherent/TA (Maintenance) groups. Self-reported adherence records did not meet recommended targets for healthful behaviors, but clinical benefits were achieved by adherent groups as indicated by effect size (Cohen's d) comparisons. SBP reduction was associated with adherence to sodium reduction in NA (d = 0.60, p < .001) and TA (d = 0.45, p < .001) compared to N-A (d = 0.13, p > .05). Marginally increasing fruit and vegetable consumption (DELTA = 0.41 servings) resulted in sizeable reductions in weight for NA (d = 0.81, p < .001) > TA (d = 0.54, p < .001) > N-A (d = 0.21, p > .05) and in WC for NA (d = 0.68, p < .00) > TA (d = 0.53, p < .001) > N-A (d = 0.52, p > .05). Exercise behavior was least successful as pedometer counting was below 10,000 steps but sizeable weight and WC reductions were largest for NA (d = 0.71 and 0.79, respectively) > TA (d = 0.60 and 0.53, respectively) > N-A (d = 0.33 and 0.35, respectively). Patients reporting a shift to positive stages of change behaviors enjoyed clinically beneficial reductions in SBP, DBP, weight, and WC. Copyright © 2014 Society for Public Health Education.

TI  - An informed shared decision making programme on the prevention of myocardial infarction for patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care: protocol of a cluster randomised, controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: International and national societies claim a patient centred approach including shared decision making (SDM) in diabetes care. In a previous project, a SDM programme on the prevention of myocardial infarction has been developed. It is aimed at supporting patients with type 2 diabetes to make informed choices on preventive options, to share the decision making process with the health care team, and to improve adherence to the chosen treatment. In this study, the programme will be implemented and evaluated in primary care practices.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster randomised, controlled trial will be conducted to compare the SDM programme with standard care enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes (N = 306) from primary care practices (N = 24). The intervention programme comprises a six hours provider training, a patient decision aid including evidence-based information, a 90 minutes structured teaching session provided by medical assistants, a sheet to document the patients' individual treatment goals, and a structured consultation with the general practitioner for sharing information, setting treatment goals, and for adapting treatment regimens if necessary. Patients in the control group receive a brief extract of recommendations of the German National Disease Management Guideline on the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Primary outcome measure is adherence to blood pressure treatment and statin treatment at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures comprise informed choice and the achievement of patients' treatment goals. Analyses will be carried out on intention-to-treat basis. Concurrent qualitative methods will be used to explore the implementation processes.
AB  - DISCUSSION: At the end of this study, information on the efficacy of the SDM programme in the primary care context will be available. In addition, processes that might interfere with or that might promote a successful implementation will be identified.

TI  - Effectiveness of pharmaceutical care at discharge in the emergency department: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient education on pharmacological therapy may increase medication adherence and decrease hospitalizations. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmaceutical care at emergency department discharge in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be recruited from a public emergency department at Restinga district in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. A total of 380 patients will be randomly assigned into 2 groups at the moment of emergency department discharge after receiving medical orientations: an intervention group, consisting of a structured individual counseling session by a pharmacist in addition to written orientations, or a control group, consisting only of written information about the disease. Outcomes will be assessed in an ambulatory visit 2 months after the randomization. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with high medication adherence assessed using the Morisky-Green Test and the Brief Medication Questionnaire. The secondary outcomes are reduction of blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, quality of life and number of visits to the emergency department.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Pharmaceutical care interventions have shown to be feasible and effective in increasing medication adherence in both hospital outpatient and community pharmacy settings. However, there have been no previous assessments of the effectiveness of pharmacy care interventions initiated in patients discharged from emergency departments. Our hypothesis is that pharmaceutical counseling is also effective in this population.

TI  - Clinical impacts of additive use of olmesartan in hypertensive patients with chronic heart failure: the supplemental benefit of an angiotensin receptor blocker in hypertensive patients with stable heart failure using olmesartan (SUPPORT) trial.
AB  - We examined whether an additive treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker, olmesartan, reduces the mortality and morbidity in hypertensive patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, or both. In this prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint study, a total of 1147 hypertensive patients with symptomatic CHF (mean age 66 years, 75% male) were randomized to the addition of olmesartan (n = 578) to baseline therapy vs. control (n = 569). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization for worsening heart failure. During a median follow-up of 4.4 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 192 patients (33.2%) in the olmesartan group and in 166 patients (29.2%) in the control group [hazard ratio (HR) 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.46, P = 0.112], while renal dysfunction developed more frequently in the olmesartan group (16.8 vs. 10.7%, HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.19-2.26, P = 0.003). Subgroup analysis revealed that addition of olmesartan to combination of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers was associated with increased incidence of the primary endpoint (38.1 vs. 28.2%, HR 1.47; 95% CI 1.11-1.95, P = 0.006), all-cause death (19.4 vs. 13.5%, HR 1.50; 95% CI 1.01-2.23, P = 0.046), and renal dysfunction (21.1 vs. 12.5%, HR 1.85; 95% CI 1.24-2.76, P = 0.003). Additive use of olmesartan did not improve clinical outcomes but worsened renal function in hypertensive CHF patients treated with evidence-based medications. Particularly, the triple combination therapy with olmesartan, ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers was associated with increased adverse cardiac events.

TI  - A pharmacist based intervention to improve the care of patients with CKD: a pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary care providers do not routinely follow guidelines for the care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Multidisciplinary efforts may improve care for patients with chronic disease. Pharmacist based interventions have effectively improved management of hypertension. We performed a pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a pharmacist based quality improvement program on 1) outcomes for patients with CKD and 2) adherence to CKD guidelines in the primary care setting.
AB  - METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe CKD receiving primary care services at one of thirteen community-based Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics were randomized to a multifactorial intervention that included a phone-based pharmacist intervention, pharmacist-physician collaboration, patient education, and a CKD registry (n=1070) or usual care (n=1129). The primary process outcome was measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) during the one year study period. The primary clinical outcome was blood pressure (BP) control in subjects with poorly controlled hypertension at baseline.
AB  - RESULTS: Among those with poorly controlled baseline BP, there was no difference in the last recorded BP or the percent at goal BP during the study period (42.0% vs. 41.2% in the control arm). Subjects in the intervention arm were more likely to have a PTH measured during the study period (46.9% vs. 16.1% in the control arm, P <0.001) and were on more classes of antihypertensive medications at the end of the study (P=0.02).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A one-time pharmacist based intervention proved feasible in patients with CKD. While the intervention did not improve BP control, it did improve guideline adherence and increased the number of antihypertensive medications prescribed to subjects with poorly controlled BP. These findings can inform the design of quality improvement programs and future studies which are needed to improve care of patients with CKD.

TI  - Sudarshan Kriya yoga improves quality of life in healthy people living with HIV (PLHIV): results from an open label randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Improving quality of life (QOL) of healthy people living with HIV (PLHIV) is critical needing home-based, long-term strategy. Sudarshan Kriya yoga (SKY) intervention is acknowledged for its positive impact on health. It is hypothesised that SKY would improve PLHIV's QOL, justifying an evaluation.
AB  - METHODS: In this open label randomized controlled pilot trial, 61 adult PLHIV with CD4 count more than 400 cells/micro l and Karnofsky scale score above 70 were enrolled. Those with cardiac disease, jaundice, tuberculosis, or on antiretroviral therapy/yoga intervention were excluded. All were given standard care, randomized to SKY intervention (31: I-SKY) and only standard of care in control (30: O-SOC) arms. The I-SKY participants were trained for six days to prepare for daily practice of SKY at home for 30 min. A validated 31-item WHOQOL-HIVBREF questionnaire was used to document effect in both arms from baseline to three visits at 4 wk interval.
AB  - RESULTS: Baseline QOL scores, hypertension and CD4 count were similar in both arms. An overall 6 per cent improvement of QOL scores was observed in I-SKY group as compared to O-SOC group, after controlling for baseline variables like age, gender, education and occupation ( p =0.016); 12 per cent for physical ( p =0.004), 11 per cent psychological (p =0.023) and 9 per cent level of independence (p =0.001) domains. Improvement in I-SKY observed at post-training and in the SKY adherence group showed increase in these two domains.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A significant improvement in QOL scores was observed for the three health related QOL domains in SKY intervention arm. This low cost strategy improved physical and psychological state of PLHIV calling for upscaling with effective monitoring for sustainability of quality of life.

TI  - [The Antihypertensive Effect of the Fixed Combination of Lisinopril and Amlodipine in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting]. [Russian]
AB  - Literature data and results of our own register have indicate that hypertension is one of the most common risk factor in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). But despite proven benefits of control of hypertension after CABG adherence of patients to corresponding recommendations remains low. Fixed combinations of antihypertensive drugs are associated with better compliance. In 30 IHD patients after CABG we studied effects of fixed lisinoprillamlodipine combination. This combination was safe and had high antihypertensive activity. Practically all patients responded to therapy and achieved target level of arterial pressure.

TI  - Perindopril arginine + amlodipine for the treatment of hypertension in the USA.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Controlling blood pressure is a global health priority; single-pill combinations of antihypertensive agents are often prescribed to improve adherence, persistence, and outcomes.
AB  - AREAS COVERED: A novel preparation of perindopril arginine and amlodipine besylate was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on 21 Jan 2015, based primarily on a 837-subject, 6-week, randomized, multicenter, prospective, clinical trial. The maximal marketed dose of the combination (14/10 mg daily) lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly more than either monotherapy, with a reduction in adverse effects (especially ankle edema), compared to amlodipine alone.
AB  - EXPERT OPINION: Substantial clinical trial experience with amlodipine or perindopril suggests that these two agents effectively lower blood pressure, and may reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. In the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, hypertensive subjects randomized to receive these two drugs (in sequence) had a significantly lower incidence of several types of clinical events, compared to those who received atenolol +/- bendroflumethiazide. The new formulation of perindopril arginine protects its ethyl ester, without requiring physical separation from amlodipine in a single pill, and is less hydroscopic than perindopril erbumine. These and other attributes may make this combination an attractive addition to the antihypertensive armamentarium.

TI  - Multidomain Lifestyle Interventions for the Prevention of Cognitive Decline After Ischemic Stroke: Randomized Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive impairment occurs in <30% of all stroke survivors. However, effective therapies aimed at preventing poststroke cognitive decline are lacking. We assessed the efficacy of a multidomain intervention on preventing cognitive decline after stroke.
AB  - METHODS: In this randomized, observer-blind trial patients were recruited within 3 months after an acute stroke in 5 Austrian neurological centers. Patients were assigned to a 24-month lifestyle-based multidomain intervention or standard stroke care. Primary outcomes were the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and occurrence of cognitive decline in the composite scores of at least 2 of 5 cognitive domains at 24 months.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were randomized into multi-intervention and 101 into standard care during June 2010 and November 2012. Of them, 76 patients in the intervention group and 83 in the control group were included in the final intention-to-treat analysis. At 24 months, 8 of 76 (10.5%) patients in the intervention group and 10 of 83 (12.0%) patients in the control group showed cognitive decline corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 0.874 (95% confidence interval, 0.364-2.098). The change in ADAS-cog from baseline to 24 months was not different either (median 0 [IQR, -1 to 2] in both groups; P=0.808).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This trial found no benefit of 24-month multidomain intervention with focus on improvement in lifestyle and vascular risk factors on the incidence of poststroke cognitive decline in comparison with standard stroke care. Studies with a larger sample size are needed.

TI  - DASH diet, insulin resistance, and serum hs-CRP in polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  - UNLABELLED: This study was designed to assess the effects of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan on insulin resistance and serum hs-CRP in overweight and obese women with PCOS. This randomized controlled clinical trial was done on 48 women diagnosed with PCOS. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume either the control (n=24) or the DASH eating pattern (n=24) for 8 weeks. The DASH diet consisted of 52% carbohydrates, 18% proteins, and 30% total fats. It was designed to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and low in saturated fats, cholesterol, refined grains, and sweets. Sodium content of the DASH diet was designed to be less than 2400mg/day. The control diet was also designed to contain 52% carbohydrates, 18% protein, and 30% total fat. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 8 weeks intervention to measure -insulin resistance and serum hs-CRP levels. -Adherence to the DASH eating pattern, compared to the -control diet, resulted in a significant reduction of serum insulin levels (-1.88 vs. 2.89muIU/ml, p=0.03), HOMA-IR score (-0.45 vs. 0.80; p=0.01), and serum hs-CRP levels (-763.29 vs. 665.95ng/ml, p=0.009). Additionally, a significant reduction in waist (-5.2 vs. -2.1cm; p=0.003) and hip circumference (-5.9 vs. -1cm; p<0.0001) was also seen in the DASH group compared with the control group. In conclusion, consumption of the DASH eating pattern for 8 weeks in overweight and obese women with PCOS resulted in the improvement of insulin resistance, serum hs-CRP levels, and abdominal fat accumulation.

TI  - Adherence with antihypertensive drug therapy and the risk of heart failure in clinical practice.
AB  - Randomized clinical trials have shown that antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of heart failure (HF). Limited evidence exists, however, on whether and to what extent this benefit is translated into real-life practice. A nested case-control study was carried out by including the cohort of 76 017 patients from Lombardy (Italy), aged 40 to 80 years, who were newly treated with antihypertensive drugs during 2005. Cases were the 622 patients who experienced hospitalization for HF from initial prescription until 2012. Up to 5 controls were randomly selected for each case. Logistic regression was used to model the HF risk associated with adherence to antihypertensive drugs, which was measured by the proportion of days covered by treatment (PDC). Data were adjusted for several covariates. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for possible sources of systematic uncertainty. Compared with patients with very low adherence (PDC, <25%), low, intermediate, and high adherences were associated with progressively lower risk of HF, reduction in the high-adherence group (>75%) being 34% (95% confidence interval, 17%-48%). Similar effects were observed in younger (40-70 years) and older (71-80 years) patients and between patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. There was no evidence that adherence with calcium-channel blockers reduced the HF risk. Antihypertensive treatment lowers the HF risk in real-life practice, but adherence to treatment is necessary for a substantial benefit to take place. This is the case with a variety of antihypertensive drugs. Copyright © 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.

TI  - Is the failure of SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial to meet its efficacy endpoint the "end of the road" for renal denervation?. [Review]
AB  - Resistant hypertension is a common medical problem that is increasing with the advent of an increasingly older and heavier population. The etiology of resistant hypertension is almost always multifactorial, but the results of numerous studies indicate that renal sympathetic activation is a particularly common cause of resistance to antihypertensive treatment. Consistent with the belief in a pivotal role of renal sympathetic stimulation, there has been a growing interest in renal denervation (RDN) treatment strategies. The long-awaited results of SYMPLICITY HTN-3 study disclosed that the reduction in blood pressure by the SYMPLICITY device did not differ from that in the sham-procedure arm of the study. In the present article, we identify several factors that explain why the study failed to demonstrate any benefit from the intervention. The reasons are multifactorial and include inadequate screening at entry and frequent medication changes during the study. Additional problems include the lack of experience of many operators with the SYMPLICITY device and procedure variability, as attested to by a diminished number of ablation "quadrants." Also a factor was the inability of the first generation Medtronic device to allow four ablations to be performed simultaneously. We recommend that future RDN studies adhere to more rigorous screening procedures, and utilize newer multi-site denervation systems that facilitate four ablations simultaneously. Drug optimization should be achieved by monitoring adherence throughout the study. Nevertheless, we are optimistic about a future role of RDN. To optimize chances of success, increased efforts are necessary to identify the appropriate patients for RDN and investigators must use second and third generation denervation devices and techniques.

TI  - [Antihypertensive drug therapy : Where do we stand?]. [German]
AB  - Antihypertensive drug therapy is one of the most successful medical measures ever, at all levels. The treatment situation in Germany has clearly improved in recent years. Nowadays, a wide range of very effective and well-tolerated hypertensive substances is available. Combination therapy has a long and successful tradition in hypertensive treatment, especially with suitable fixed combinations. Furthermore, the administration of fixed combinations is very beneficial to therapy adherence because it is essentially dependent on the number of drugs to be taken. The value of beta blockers and the double blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are under discussion and the interpretation of corresponding studies must be conducted very carefully. The hypertensive effect of a substance cannot be comprehensively assessed without taking the time of day, the time point of measurement and the time point of intake into consideration. This is particularly important with respect to the effect over 24 h. Optimal antihypertensive therapy must also take into consideration the individual blood pressure rhythm with respect to the dose and dosing intervals. The importance of the central (aortic) blood pressure as target blood pressure will increase.

TI  - Effectiveness of involving pharmacists in the process of ambulatory health care to improve drug treatment adherence and disease control.
AB  - RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating the pharmacist into the ambulatory health care team to increase the proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or hypertension who adhere to their drug regimen and to improve disease control.
AB  - METHODS: A non-randomized clinical trial was carried out in patients with T2DM and/or hypertension from two primary care clinics. Patients from one of the clinics comprised the intervention group (IG) who received 'counselling' from the pharmacist. The control group (CG) was comprised of patients who attended another clinic and received the usual care. Adherence was measured by counting pills; hypertension control was evaluated by blood pressure and diabetes control by blood glucose. Statistical analysis was carried out by intention to treat using generalized linear models.
AB  - RESULTS: There were 440 patients included. There was no difference in the proportion of IG and CG patients who adhered to treatment according to baseline measurements. An increase in the proportion of adherence at baseline and final determination was observed in both groups (IG 71-80%, P=0.006 and CG 72-87%, P=0.000). Generalized linear models showed a 55% or higher probability of IG patients achieving control of hypertension in comparison with the CG. Patients from the IG with T2DM have 13% more possibility of achieving glycaemic control than those of the CG.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Counselling offered by the pharmacist proved to be effective for improving drug adherence of diabetic and hypertensive patients in ambulatory health care.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The association of family social support, depression, anxiety and self-efficacy with specific hypertension self-care behaviours in Chinese local community.
AB  - This study aimed to test the role of family social support, depression, anxiety and self-efficacy on specific self-care behaviours. In a local community health center, 318 patients with hypertension completed a questionnaire assessing self-care, family social support, depression, anxiety and self-efficacy in 2012. Each self-care behaviour was separately analyzed with logistic regression models. The mean score of perceived family social support for hypertension treatment was 20.91 (maximum=60). Adult children were identified as the primary support source. Approximately 22.3% and 15.4% of participants reported symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Participants had moderately positive levels of confidence performing self-care (42.1+/-13.3 out of 60). After adjusting for demographic and health variables, a 10-unit increase in family social support increased the odds ratio (OR) of taking medication by 1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.87) and increased the OR for measuring blood pressure (BP) regularly by 1.33 (95% CI 1.02-1.74). Depression and anxiety were not associated with any self-care behaviours. A10-unit increase in self-efficacy increased the adjusted OR for performing physical exercise to 1.25 (95% CI 1.04-1.49). In conclusion, family social support was positively associated with medication adherence and regular BP measurement. Strategies to improve family social support should be developed for hypertension control, yet further prospective studies are needed to understand the effects of family social support, depression, anxiety and self-efficacy on self-care behaviours.

TI  - Application of global positioning system methods for the study of obesity and hypertension risk among low-income housing residents in New York City: a spatial feasibility study.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using global positioning system (GPS) methods to understand the spatial context of obesity and hypertension risk among a sample of low-income housing residents in New York City (n = 120). GPS feasibility among participants was measured with a pre- and post-survey as well as adherence to a protocol which included returning the GPS device as well as objective data analysed from the GPS devices. We also conducted qualitative interviews with 21 of the participants. Most of the sample was overweight (26.7%) or obese (40.0%). Almost one-third (30.8%) was pre-hypertensive and 39.2% was hypertensive. Participants reported high ratings of GPS acceptability, ease of use and low levels of wear-related concerns in addition to few concerns related to safety, loss or appearance, which were maintained after the baseline GPS feasibility data collection. Results show that GPS feasibility increased over time. The overall GPS return rate was 95.6%. Out of the total of 114 participants with GPS, 112 (98.2%) delivered at least one hour of GPS data for one day and 84 (73.7%) delivered at least one hour on 7 or more days. The qualitative interviews indicated that overall, participants enjoyed wearing the GPS devices, that they were easy to use and charge and that they generally forgot about the GPS device when wearing it daily. Findings demonstrate that GPS devices may be used in spatial epidemiology research in low-income and potentially other key vulnerable populations to understand geospatial determinants of obesity, hypertension and other diseases that these populations disproportionately experience.

TI  - Patient and professional user experiences of simple telehealth for hypertension, medication reminders and smoking cessation: a service evaluation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To establish patient and professional user satisfaction with the Advice & Interactive Messaging (AIM) for Health programme delivered using a mobile phone-based, simple telehealth intervention, 'Florence'.
AB  - DESIGN: A service evaluation using data extracted from Florence and from a professional user electronic survey.
AB  - SETTING: 425 primary care practices across 31 Clinical Commissioning Groups in England.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 3381 patients registered on 1 of 10 AIM protocols between March 2013 and January 2014 and 77 professional users.
AB  - INTERVENTION: The AIM programme offered 10 clinical protocols, in three broad groups: (1) hypertension diagnosis/monitoring, (2) medication reminders and (3) smoking cessation. Florence sent patients prompts to submit clinical information, educational messages and user satisfaction questions. Patient responses were reviewed by their primary healthcare providers.
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients and professional user experiences of using AIM, and within this, Florence.
AB  - RESULTS: Patient activity using Florence was generally good at month 1 for the hypertension protocols (71-80%), but reduced over 2-3 months (31-60%). For the other protocols, patient activity was 0-39% at 3 months. Minimum target days of texting were met for half the hypertension protocols. 1707/2304 (74%) patients sent evaluative texts responded at least once. Among responders, agreement with the adapted friends and family statement generally exceeded preproject aspirations. Professional responders were generally positive or equivocal about the programme.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with AIM appeared optimal when patients were carefully selected for the protocol; professional users were familiar with the system, the programme addressed a problem with the previous service delivery that was identified by users and users took an active approach to achieve clinical goals. However, there was a significant decrease in patients' use of Florence over time. Future applications may be optimised by identifying and addressing reasons for the waning use of the service and enhancing support during implementation of the service.Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

TI  - Effects of a behavioral intervention that emphasizes spices and herbs on adherence to recommended sodium intake: results of the SPICE randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For decades, dietary sodium intake in the United States has remained high, and few studies have examined strategies for maintaining recommended intakes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of a behavioral intervention, which emphasized spices and herbs, on the maintenance of sodium intake at the recommended intake of 1500 mg/d in individuals to whom the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans apply.
AB  - DESIGN: We conducted a 2-phase study that included adults >18 y of age for whom Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends 1500 mg Na/d. The study was conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, from 2012 to 2014. In phase 1, 55 individuals consumed a low-sodium diet for 4 wk. Participants were provided all foods, snacks, and calorie-containing drinks. In phase 2, 40 participants from phase 1 were randomly assigned to either a behavioral intervention to reduce sodium intake (n = 20) or a self-directed control group (n = 20) for 20 wk. The primary study outcome was the change in mean 24-h urinary sodium excretion during phase 2. Linear regression analyses were used to determine intervention effects on urinary sodium excretion.
AB  - RESULTS: Participant characteristics were as follows: women: 65%; African American: 88%; hypertension: 63%; diabetes: 18%; mean age: 61 y; and mean body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 30. At the end of phase 2, mean 24-h sodium excretion was lower in the behavioral intervention than in the self-directed group (mean difference: -956.8 mg/d; 95% CI: -1538.7, -374.9 mg/d) after sodium intake at screening was controlled for (P = 0.002). These findings persisted in sensitivity analyses that excluded potentially incomplete urine collections [Mage's equation mean difference: -1090 mg/d (P = 0.001); Joosens' equation mean difference: -796 mg/d (P = 0.04)].
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifactorial behavioral intervention emphasizing spices and herbs significantly reduced sodium intake. Because of the ubiquity of sodium in the US food supply, multilevel strategies addressing individual behaviors and the food supply are needed to improve adherence to recommendations.

TI  - A Multicomponent Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Stroke Risk Factor Behaviors: The Stroke Health and Risk Education Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Stroke Health and Risk Education Project was a cluster-randomized, faith-based, culturally sensitive, theory-based multicomponent behavioral intervention trial to reduce key stroke risk factor behaviors in Hispanics/Latinos and European Americans.
AB  - METHODS: Ten Catholic churches were randomized to intervention or control group. The intervention group received a 1-year multicomponent intervention (with poor adherence) that included self-help materials, tailored newsletters, and motivational interviewing counseling calls. Multilevel modeling, accounting for clustering within subject pairs and parishes, was used to test treatment differences in the average change since baseline (ascertained at 6 and 12 months) in dietary sodium, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity, measured using standardized questionnaires. A priori, the trial was considered successful if any one of the 3 outcomes was significant at the 0.05/3 level.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 801 subjects who consented, 760 completed baseline data assessments, and of these, 86% completed at least one outcome assessment. The median age was 53 years; 84% subjects were Hispanic/Latino; and 64% subjects were women. The intervention group had a greater increase in fruit and vegetable intake than the control group (0.25 cups per day [95% confidence interval: 0.08, 0.42], P=0.002), a greater decrease in sodium intake (-123.17 mg/d [-194.76, -51.59], P=0.04), but no difference in change in moderate- or greater-intensity physical activity (-27 metabolic equivalent-minutes per week [-526, 471], P=0.56).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This multicomponent behavioral intervention targeting stroke risk factors in predominantly Hispanics/Latinos was effective in increasing fruit and vegetable intake, reaching its primary end point. The intervention also seemed to lower sodium intake. Church-based health promotions can be successful in primary stroke prevention efforts.

TI  - Can hand-held computers improve adherence to guidelines? A (Palm) Pilot study of family doctors in British Columbia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether Palm Prevention, a free software tool for Palm OS personal digital assistants (PDAs) that provides quick access to preventive guidelines in a patient-specific manner at the point of care, improved adherence to five preventive measures in primary care.
AB  - DESIGN: Prospective intervention pilot study.
AB  - SETTING: Vancouver, BC, and surrounding area.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Eight general practitioners.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Each physician used Palm Prevention for five preventive measures during routine preventive health visits with 10 patients (n = 80). Charts of consenting patients were reviewed for documentation of recommended maneuvers.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of adherence to five evidence-based guidelines selected from the Canadian and American task forces on preventive care and incorporated into Palm Prevention.
AB  - RESULTS: Intervention and control physicians were similar in their familiarity with and use of PDAs, and they recruited similar patients for the study. Intervention and control groups had similar rates of screening for hypertension. Intervention improved adherence to the remaining four guidelines: cervical cancer screening increased 22% (only absolute increases are reported); hyperlipidemia screening increased 30%; colorectal cancer screening increased 27%; and prophylaxis with acetylsalicylic acid in high-risk patients increased 38%. Participants were surveyed after the study; all reported that they found the software helpful and would continue using Palm Prevention. Usage statistics showed that study participants used the tool outside the trial: users entered between 28 and 68 unique patients into the program during the 2-month intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests PDAs are useful in improving preventive care and facilitating translation of knowledge into practice. This was particularly apparent with newer guidelines.

TI  - Clinical program for screening and treatment of hypertension in veterans.
AB  - Hypertension clinics, in which primary care is provided by specially trained nonphysician therapists under physician supervision, can provide very effective and relatively inexpensive control of hypertension for large numbers of patients. Since 1972, 32 VA Hypertension Screening and Treatment Clinics have screened about 500,000 veterans, 29 percent of whom have had diastolic pressures of 90 mmHg or more and 13 percent of whom have had diastolic pressures of 105 mmHg or more. Of subjects who returned for a second visit, 77 percent continued to have diastolic pressures of 90 mmHg or more. Blacks had a higher percentage of severe hypertension than whites.Since treatment became available in these clinics in 1974, 25,000 veterans have been treated. Computerized data are available for 10,777 of them who began treatment during 1974, 1975, or 1976. Of those with at least five treatment visits during that period, half had diastolic pressures below 90 mmHg at their most recent visit, and 80 percent had diastolic pressures below 100 mmHg. Moreover visit adherence was high, with two thirds of those who began treatment in these clinics during their first six months of operation continuing that treatment for two and a half years.

TI  - Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Lutein/Zeaxanthin, or Other Nutrient Supplementation on Cognitive Function: The AREDS2 Randomized Clinical Trial.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Observational data have suggested that high dietary intake of saturated fat and low intake of vegetables may be associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of oral supplementation with nutrients on cognitive function.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a double-masked randomized clinical trial (the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 [AREDS2]), retinal specialists in 82 US academic and community medical centers enrolled and observed participants who were at risk for developing late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) from October 2006 to December 2012. In addition to annual eye examinations, several validated cognitive function tests were administered via telephone by trained personnel at baseline and every 2 years during the 5-year study.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) (1 g) and/or lutein (10 mg)/zeaxanthin (2 mg) vs placebo were tested in a factorial design. All participants were also given varying combinations of vitamins C, E, beta carotene, and zinc.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the yearly change in composite scores determined from a battery of cognitive function tests from baseline. The analyses, which were adjusted for baseline age, sex, race, history of hypertension, education, cognitive score, and depression score, evaluated the differences in the composite score between the treated vs untreated groups. The composite score provided an overall score for the battery, ranging from -22 to 17, with higher scores representing better function.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 89% (3741/4203) of AREDS2 participants consented to the ancillary cognitive function study and 93.6% (3501/3741) underwent cognitive function testing. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 72.7 (7.7) years and 57.5% were women. There were no statistically significant differences in change of scores for participants randomized to receive supplements vs those who were not. The yearly change in the composite cognitive function score was -0.19 (99% CI, -0.25 to -0.13) for participants randomized to receive LCPUFAs vs -0.18 (99% CI, -0.24 to -0.12) for those randomized to no LCPUFAs (difference in yearly change, -0.03 [99% CI, -0.20 to 0.13]; P=.63). Similarly, the yearly change in the composite cognitive function score was -0.18 (99% CI, -0.24 to -0.11) for participants randomized to receive lutein/zeaxanthin vs -0.19 (99% CI, -0.25 to -0.13) for those randomized to not receive lutein/zeaxanthin (difference in yearly change, 0.03 [99% CI, -0.14 to 0.19]; P=.66). Analyses were also conducted to assess for potential interactions between LCPUFAs and lutein/zeaxanthin and none were found to be significant.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older persons with AMD, oral supplementation with LCPUFAs or lutein/zeaxanthin had no statistically significant effect on cognitive function.

TI  - Barnidipine real-life tolerability in arterial hypertension: results from the BASIC-HT study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Blood pressure (BP) is generally poorly controlled in hypertensive patients. One cause is poor adherence to drugs, which can be improved by treatments combining good efficacy and tolerability. Barnidipine is a strong lipophilic calcium channel blocker (CCB) with efficacy similar to other dihydropyridines.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: BASIC HT is an observational study in a large population of patients with essential hypertension to evaluate the tolerability of barnidipine in a real-life setting.
AB  - METHODS: 20479 patients were enrolled in the study. Tolerability and efficacy was assessed at 2 visits during a 3-month period. 20275 patients were included in the analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Adverse events were reported by 10.6% of the patients, leading to treatment discontinuation in 3%. Events were those expected with CCBs. The drop-out rate was 8%. Mean systolic and diastolic pressure decreased from 159.6 to 138.2 and from 92.5 to 81.7 mmHg.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The decrease in BP, is probably due to stimulation of good adherence by barnidipine.

TI  - Long-Term Change in Diet Quality Is Associated with Body Weight Change in Men and Women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little evidence exists on change in diet quality and weight change.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between change of diet quality indexes and concurrent weight change over 20 y.
AB  - METHODS: In this analysis we followed 50,603 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), 22,973 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) between 1986 and 2006, and 72,495 younger women from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) between 1989 and 2007. Diet was measured every 4 y. We computed the Alternate Mediterranean Diet, the Alternate Health Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension adherence scores for each participant. All scores emphasize fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and nuts, but they differ in score range and components such as dairy, sodium, and sweetened beverages. Regression models were used to examine 4-y changes in these scores and weight change within the same period, adjusting for lifestyle factors.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean age at baseline was 49.4 y for NHS, 48.0 y for HPFS, and 36.3 y for NHS II. Baseline BMI (in kg/m(2)) was similar (23.7 for NHS, 24.7 for HPFS, and 23.0 for NHS II). We observed significantly less weight gain over 4-y periods with each SD increase of each diet quality score in both men and women. Results were significantly stronger in the younger cohort (NHS II) than in the older cohorts (e.g., -0.67 kg less weight gain in NHS II vs. -0.39 kg in NHS for each SD increase in AHEI-2010; P-heterogeneity: <0.001). Improvement of any of the diet scores benefited overweight (-0.27 to -1.08 kg less weight gain for each SD increase in score) more than normal-weight individuals (-0.10 to -0.40 kg; P-interaction: <0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Improvement of diet quality is associated with less weight gain, especially in younger women or overweight individuals.Copyright © 2015 American Society for Nutrition.

AU  - Renal Denervation for Hypertension (DENERHTN) investigators
TI  - Optimum and stepped care standardised antihypertensive treatment with or without renal denervation for resistant hypertension (DENERHTN): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conflicting blood pressure-lowering effects of catheter-based renal artery denervation have been reported in patients with resistant hypertension. We compared the ambulatory blood pressure-lowering efficacy and safety of radiofrequency-based renal denervation added to a standardised stepped-care antihypertensive treatment (SSAHT) with the same SSAHT alone in patients with resistant hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: The Renal Denervation for Hypertension (DENERHTN) trial was a prospective, open-label randomised controlled trial with blinded endpoint evaluation in patients with resistant hypertension, done in 15 French tertiary care centres specialised in hypertension management. Eligible patients aged 18-75 years received indapamide 1.5 mg, ramipril 10 mg (or irbesartan 300 mg), and amlodipine 10 mg daily for 4 weeks to confirm treatment resistance by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring before randomisation. Patients were then randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either renal denervation plus an SSAHT regimen (renal denervation group) or the same SSAHT alone (control group). The randomisation sequence was generated by computer, and stratified by centres. For SSAHT, after randomisation, spironolactone 25 mg per day, bisoprolol 10 mg per day, prazosin 5 mg per day, and rilmenidine 1 mg per day were sequentially added from months two to five in both groups if home blood pressure was more than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg. The primary endpoint was the mean change in daytime systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months as assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The primary endpoint was analysed blindly. The safety outcomes were the incidence of acute adverse events of the renal denervation procedure and the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to 6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01570777.
AB  - FINDINGS: Between May 22, 2012, and Oct 14, 2013, 1416 patients were screened for eligibility, 106 of those were randomly assigned to treatment (53 patients in each group, intention-to-treat population) and 101 analysed because of patients with missing endpoints (48 in the renal denervation group, 53 in the control group, modified intention-to-treat population). The mean change in daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure at 6 months was -15.8 mm Hg (95% CI -19.7 to -11.9) in the renal denervation group and -9.9 mm Hg (-13.6 to -6.2) in the group receiving SSAHT alone, a baseline-adjusted difference of -5.9 mm Hg (-11.3 to -0.5; p=0.0329). The number of antihypertensive drugs and drug-adherence at 6 months were similar between the two groups. Three minor renal denervation-related adverse events were noted (lumbar pain in two patients and mild groin haematoma in one patient). A mild and similar decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to 6 months was observed in both groups.
AB  - INTERPRETATION: In patients with well defined resistant hypertension, renal denervation plus an SSAHT decreases ambulatory blood pressure more than the same SSAHT alone at 6 months. This additional blood pressure lowering effect may contribute to a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity if maintained in the long term after renal denervation.

TI  - Recidivism to uncontrolled blood pressure in patients with previously controlled hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Control of hypertension has improved nationally with focus on identifying and treating elevated blood pressures (BPs) to guideline recommended levels. However, once BP control is achieved, the frequency in which BP falls out of control and the factors associated with BP recidivism is unknown. In this retrospective cohort study conducted at 2 large, integrated health care systems we sought to examine rates and predictors of BP recidivism in adults with controlled hypertension. No change for methods, results and conclusion.
AB  - METHODS: Patients with a prior diagnosis of hypertension based on a combination of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes, receipt of antihypertensive medications, and/or elevated BP readings were eligible to be included. We defined controlled hypertension as normotensive BP readings (<140/90 mmHg or <130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes) at 2 consecutive primary care visits. We then followed up patients for BP recidivism defined by the date of the second of 2 consecutive BP readings >140/90 mmHg (>130/80 mmHg for diabetes or chronic kidney disease) during a median follow-up period of 16.6 months. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between patient characteristics, comorbidities, medication adherence, and provider medication management with time to BP recidivism.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 23,321 patients with controlled hypertension were included in this study. The proportion of patients with hypertension recidivism was 24.1% over the 16.6-month study period. For those with BP recidivism, the median time to relapse was 7.3 months. In multivariate analysis, those with diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 3.99, CI 3.67-4.33), high normal baseline BP (for systolic BP HR 1.03, CI 1.03-1.04), or low antihypertensive medication adherence (HR 1.20, CI 1.11-1.29) had significantly higher rates of hypertension recidivism. Limitations of this work include demographics of our patient sample, which may not reflect other communities in addition to the intrinsic limitations of office-based BP measurements.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive recidivism occurs in a significant portion of patients with previously well-controlled BP and accounts for a substantial fraction of patients with poorly controlled hypertension. Systematic identification of those most at risk for recidivism and implementation of strategies to minimize hypertension recidivism may improve overall levels of BP control and hypertension-related quality measures.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Unreliability of home blood pressure measurement and the effect of a patient-oriented intervention.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Home blood pressure (BP) measurement (HBPM) is recommended for the diagnosis and follow-up of high BP. It is unclear how this aspect of BP monitoring has evolved over the years and whether interventions could influence patient adherence to HBPM guidelines.
AB  - METHODS: After a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study performed in 2010, a passive, multimodal intervention, focused on improving adherence to HBPM guidelines, was implemented. A second study was conducted in 2014 to measure its effect.
AB  - RESULTS: In 2010 and 2014, 1010 and 1005 patients, respectively, completed the questionnaire. In 2010 and 2014, 82% and 84% of patients, respectively, self-measured their BP. Reporting of HBPM and adherence to recommended procedures was suboptimal. Only 34.0% of patients in 2010 and 31.7% in 2014 brought > 80% of their measurements to their doctor. Only 49.6% in 2010 and 52.9% in 2014 prepared > 80% of the time for HBPM. Only 48.1% in 2010 and 52.1% in 2014 rested for 5 minutes > 80% of the time before HBPM. Only 15% of patients in 2010 and 18% in 2014 were defined as sufficiently compliant with all HBPM procedures. Paired analysis of a subset of 535 patients who participated in the 2010 and 2014 studies showed no clinically significant differences in reliability between the 2 surveys.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to HBPM guidelines was suboptimal in 2010 and still is in 2014 despite a passive, multimodal intervention. Active training in HBPM procedures should be studied. Greater automation could improve HBPM reliability.Copyright © 2015 Canadian Cardiovascular Society. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Study CAMBIMED: Effects of changes in medication appearance on safety of antihypertensive and hypolipidemic treatments in chronic patients older than 65 years in primary health care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different studies have investigated the effects that changes in drug appearance have on the control of chronic diseases and drug safety. The main objective of the proposed study is to evaluate if changes in the appearance of the packaging and presentation of drugs having the same active ingredient are related to a decrease in adherence and an increase in usage errors for chronic treatment using antihypertensive (enalapril and amlodipine) and hypolipidemic agents (simvastatin) in patients >65 years old, over a one-year follow-up period.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: We propose a multicentric observational longitudinal cohort study with a one-year follow-up period in 8 primary health care centers (PHCC) in the Community of Madrid. 259 patients who are >65 years old, hypertensive and/or dyslipidemic, undergoing treatment with enalapril and/or amlodipine and/or simvastatin, and under formal follow-up of chronic patients in primary health care will be selected by simple random sampling. The main outcome variable will be a final combined variable (adherence and medication usage errors). Other included variables will be: sociodemographic and clinical variables of the patient, degree of disease control, drug taken, number of changes in the appearance of each drug by the pharmacy, and the type and frequency of both avoidable and non-avoidable adverse effects during the follow-up period. A descriptive and a multivariate analysis of the variables will be carried out by means of a logistic regression model, using the final combined variable as the dependent variable (error and/or inadequate usage of the drug), and variables shown to be related to it during the bivariate analysis as the independent variables.
AB  - DISCUSSION: For drugs of the same active ingredient, the effect that different package appearances and presentation may have on the safety of patients undergoing chronic treatments is unknown under the new legislative framework. There are various initiatives that promote the iso-appearance of drugs: "If they are the same, make them look the same". It is to be expected that older, multi-medicated patients with chronic pathologies will be the ones under a greater risk of suffering from this problem.

TI  - Benefits of a fixed-dose combination of bisoprolol and amlodipine in the treatment of hypertension in daily practice: results of more than 4000 patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study objective was assessing patient adherence to a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of bisoprolol and amlodipine in daily practice in patients who had been switched from the free to the fixed-dose combination prior to recruitment.
AB  - MATERIAL AND METHODS: The non-investigational study was carried out in Poland. Patients over 18 years of age with essential hypertension were recruited if they had already been switched from a free combination to the FDC at least 4 weeks prior to recruitment. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, lactation, any contraindication to the FDC, and other antihypertensive treatment. Adherence was measured by tablet count (tablets taken divided by tablets prescribed, times 100) and defined as follows: excellent >90%, good 76-90%, moderate 51-75%, bad <50%. Other patient data, clinical findings and laboratory values were recorded upon availability at study start, after 3 months (voluntary) and after 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Data of 4288 patients (mean age: 59 years; gender: 50% each) were documented. The average daily doses of the FDC were 5.8mg bisoprolol and 6.4mg amlodipine. These doses differ only slightly from those of the free combination. After 3 months' treatment with the FDC, a dose increase was carried out in 113 patients for bisoprolol and in 126 for amlodipine. After 6 months of FDC treatment, 82% of the participants of the study showed excellent adherence and for a further 15% the adherence could be considered good. This strong adherence may have led to the observed reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 11% (Cohen's D efficient size 1.23). In addition, pulse pressure decreased from 58.8mm to 52.2mm. Also in diabetic patients (21% of the cohort), further reduction of systolic blood pressure values could be achieved (mean before 150mm, after 133), wherein the initial differences compared to patients without diabetes had disappeared. The pulse rate also changed from 75b/min to 68b/min under the FDC.
AB  - CONCLUSION: These study results clearly show that the FDC leads to excellent patient adherence and therefore may result in better blood pressure control. Blood pressure control is crucial in the risk reduction of cardiovascular events. The key limitation of this study is that the study design does not allow a direct comparison of patient adherence under the free and the fixed-dose combination.

TI  - Community-based interventions in hypertensive patients: a comparison of three health education strategies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-based health education programs may be helpful in improving health outcomes in patients with chronic illnesses. This study aimed to evaluate community-based health education strategies in the management of hypertensive patients with low socioeconomic status in Dongguan City, China.
AB  - METHODS: This was a randomized, non-blinded trial involving 360 hypertensive patients enrolled in the community health service centre of Liaobu Town, Dongguan City, China. Participants were randomized to receive one of the three community-based health education programs over 2 years: self-learning reading (Group 1), monthly regular didactic lecture (Group 2), monthly interactive education workshop (Group 3). Outcomes included the changes in the proportion of subjects with normalized blood pressure (BP), hypertension-related knowledge score, adherence to antihypertensive treatment, lifestyle, body mass index and serum lipids.
AB  - RESULTS: After the 2-y intervention, the proportion of subjects with normalized BP increased significantly in Group 2 (from 41.2% to 63.2%, p<0.001), and increased more substantially in Group 3 (from 40.2% to 86.3%, p<0.001), but did not change significantly in Group 1. Improvements in hypertension-related knowledge score, adherence to regular use of medications, appropriate salt intake and regular physical activity were progressively greater from group 1 to group 2 to group 3. Group 3 had the largest reductions in body mass index and serum LDL cholesterol levels.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Interactive education workshops may be the most effective strategy in community-based health promotion education programs for hypertensive patients in improving patients' knowledge on hypertension and alleviating clinical risk factors for preventing hypertension-related complications.

TI  - [Hypertensive patients' adherence, motivation, and awareness during fixed-dose perindopril A and amlodipine combination treatment (results of the CONSTANTA trial)]. [Russian]
AB  - AIM: To estimate changes in treatment adherence and motivation and quality of life in Prestance-treated population of the observational CONSTANTA program.
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The effect of Prestance on treatment adherence and motivation and quality of life was evaluated in 2435 participants of the CONSTANTA program. It included patients with uncontrolled hypertension who generally received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists alone or in conjunction with free or fixed-dose combinations of 2-3 antihypertensive agents and who were additionally given Prestance to correct antihypertensive therapy, as decided by their doctors. The goal blood pressure (BP) was less than <140/90 mm Hg for all the patients. A modified Morisky- Green questionnaire was used to measure adherence, motivation, and awareness in the patients. Their treatment lasted three months.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 1992 (81.8%) patients in the analyzed group achieved the goal BP. When included in the study, 1076 (44.2%) patients were defined as adherent to therapy; the mean adherence index was equal to 3.12 +/- 0.86 scores; at 3 months of therapy, the number of adherents increased up to 1997 (82%) and the mean adherence index rose up to 3.6 +/- 0.74 scores. With high baseline motivation, its mean score was 1.25 +/- 0.79 in 40.1% of the patients; at 3 months the number of the motivated rose up to 70.9% (p < 0.05) and the mean score was as high as 1.75 +/- 0.60 (p < 0/05). At baseline, 44.2% of the patients showed a high awareness; its mean score was 1.42 +/- 1.12; at 3 months of therapy, both indicators significantly increased up to 82% (p < 0.05) and 2.38 +/- 0.80, respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The well tolerable BP lowering during Prestance therapy is attended by a substantial rise in treatment adherence and motivations in the patients even in the absence of special purposeful measures.

TI  - 12-month blood pressure results of catheter-based renal artery denervation for resistant hypertension: the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results of the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 (Renal Denervation in Patients With Uncontrolled Hypertension) trial confirmed the safety but not the efficacy of renal denervation for treatment-resistant hypertension at 6 months post procedure.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to analyze the 12-month SYMPLICITY HTN-3 results for the original denervation group, the sham subjects who underwent denervation after the 6-month endpoint (crossover group), and the sham subjects who did not undergo denervation after 6 months (non-crossover group).
AB  - METHODS: Eligible subjects were randomized 2:1 to denervation or sham procedure. Subjects were unblinded to their treatment group after the 6-month primary endpoint was ascertained; subjects in the sham group meeting eligibility requirements could undergo denervation. Change in blood pressure (BP) at 12 months post randomization (6 months for crossover subjects) was analyzed.
AB  - RESULTS: The 12-month follow-up was available for 319 of 361 denervation subjects and 48 of 101 non-crossover subjects; 6-month denervation follow-up was available for 93 of 101 crossover subjects. In denervation subjects, the 12-month office systolic BP (SBP) change was greater than that observed at 6 months (-15.5 +/- 24.1 mm Hg vs. -18.9 +/- 25.4 mm Hg, respectively; p = 0.025), but the 24-h SBP change was not significantly different at 12 months (p = 0.229). The non-crossover group office SBP decreased by -32.9 +/- 28.1 mm Hg at 6 months, but this response regressed to -21.4 +/- 19.9 mm Hg (p = 0.01) at 12 months, increasing to 11.5 +/- 29.8 mm Hg.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: These data support no further reduction in office or ambulatory BP after 1-year follow-up. Loss of BP reduction in the non-crossover group may reflect decreased medication adherence or other related factors.

TI  - One-year safety of ibuprofen/famotidine fixed combination versus ibuprofen alone: pooled analyses of two 24-week randomized, double-blind trials and a follow-on extension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of the fixed combination of ibuprofen and famotidine compared with ibuprofen alone from two 24-week, multicenter, double-blind trials designed to evaluate the comparative incidence of endoscopically documented upper gastrointestinal ulcers and a 28-week double-blind extension study.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Safety was analyzed by pooling data from the two double-blind trials and the follow-on study. Safety was assessed by monitoring the incidence, causality, and severity of adverse events (AEs).
AB  - RESULTS: In the pivotal efficacy and safety trials, discontinuation rates due to any cause and dyspepsia were significantly lower for the ibuprofen/famotidine combination versus ibuprofen alone. Other than dyspepsia, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular AEs of special interest were similar. Events judged to be treatment related were significantly lower with the ibuprofen/famotidine combination (20.6% vs. 25%). In the safety extension population, there were no differences in the discontinuation rates and the reporting of AEs or serious AEs (SAEs) between the two groups. Gastrointestinal-related events were similar between the groups. Incidence of cardiovascular-related AEs of special interest were 11% (ibuprofen/famotidine) and 2% (ibuprofen) (p=0.06), possibly due to a higher number of rheumatoid arthritis patients in the combination group. Of these, 80% were reports of hypertension (8% ibuprofen/famotidine vs. 2% ibuprofen). Three cases of hypertension in the ibuprofen/famotidine group were considered treatment related. The probability of a cardiovascular event decreased during days 112-167 of treatment and remained low with continued treatment.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: One-year safety data from two pivotal trials and a long-term extension study indicate that the ibuprofen/famotidine combination demonstrates a favorable gastrointestinal safety profile and more patients continued on therapy compared to ibuprofen alone. No new safety signals have been identified. These data offer additional evidence supporting a new therapeutic option to improve gastrointestinal safety and adherence for patients who require long-term ibuprofen.

TI  - Evaluating the safety and efficacy of sodium-restricted/Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet after acute decompensated heart failure hospitalization: design and rationale for the Geriatric OUt of hospital Randomized MEal Trial in Heart Failure (GOURMET-HF).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem affecting predominantly older adults. Nonadherence to diet remains a significant contributor to acute decompensated HF (ADHF). The sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD) eating plan reduces cardiovascular dysfunction that can lead to ADHF and is consistent with current HF guidelines. We propose that an intervention that promotes adherence to the DASH/SRD by home-delivering meals will be safe and improve health-related quality of life (QOL) in older adults after hospitalization for ADHF.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 3-center, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial of 12-week duration designed to determine the safety and efficacy of home-delivered DASH/SRD-compliant meals in older adults after discharge from ADHF hospitalization. Sixty-six subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 stratified fashion by gender and left ventricular ejection fraction (<50% vs >50%). Study subjects will receive either preprepared, home-delivered DASH/SRD-compliant meals or usual dietary advice for 4weeks after hospital discharge. Investigators will be blinded to group assignment, food diaries, and urinary electrolyte measurements until study completion. The primary efficacy end point is the change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary scores for health-related QOL from study enrollment to 4weeks postdischarge. Safety evaluation will focus on hypotension, renal insufficiency, and hyperkalemia. Exploratory end points include echocardiography, noninvasive vascular testing, markers of oxidative stress, and salt taste sensitivity.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of 4weeks of DASH/SRD after ADHF hospitalization. By testing a novel dietary intervention supported by multiple levels of evidence including preliminary data in outpatients with stable HF, we will address a critical evidence gap in the care of older patients with ADHF. If effective and safe, this intervention could be scaled to assess effects on readmission and healthcare costs in older adults after ADHF.Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Physical activity and better medication compliance improve mini-mental state examination scores in the elderly.
AB  - In addition to hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and diabetes, a sedentary lifestyle plays a pivotal role in cerebro- and cardiovascular disease and progressive cognitive decline, including vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The present study investigated whether controlling the key risks and participating in physical activity have a beneficial impact on these disorders. Elderly volunteers were enrolled in a 3-month program that consisted of structured exercise three times per week. The daily routine, medical treatment, and vital parameters were evaluated and correlated with the subjects' neuropsychiatric status. High blood pressure was found in 40% of the participants, with no significant differences between the sexes. A higher proportion of females (55%) than males (18%) forgot to take their medication during the observation period. Significant negative correlations were found between Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and age, lack of a caregiver, and increased pulse rate before or after exercise. These results suggest that the presence of home assistance and subsequent improvement in medication compliance, vital parameter optimization, and regular physical activity may yield better MMSE results and a lower risk for cerebro- and cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2014 S.

TI  - A randomized telephone intervention trial to reduce primary medication nonadherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary medication nonadherence (PMN), defined as patients not picking up an initial prescription, can limit the effectiveness of therapy for chronic conditions. Effective interventions to reduce PMN have not been widely studied or implemented.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of an additional nurse-directed telephone intervention to reduce PMN in a cohort of patients with persistent nonadherence after repeated pharmacy-based outreach.
AB  - METHODS: Patients in the Geisinger Health System receiving new (i.e., initially prescribed) prescriptions sent to CVS pharmacies for medications treating asthma, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia were identified. As part of existing programs, all patients received 2 automated and 1 live call from CVS pharmacies encouraging them to pick up their prescriptions; those who had canceled their prescriptions or had not picked them up after the 3 pharmacy interventions were eligible for this study. Patients were then randomized, and the intervention group received telephone outreach from a nursing call center to assess reasons for PMN and encourage pickup of prescriptions, with up to 3 attempts to reach each patient. Medication pickup rates were compared across the intervention and control groups.
AB  - RESULTS: Initial PMN rates in the overall population were 6%, lower than previously observed in other studies. A total of 290 patients had not picked up their prescriptions after 3 calls from the pharmacy and were enrolled in the study: 142 in the intervention group and 148 controls. The intervention did not change the rate at which patients picked up their prescriptions: 25% of intervention patients did so compared with 24% of control patients. Multivariate models adjusting for patient characteristics and medication classes did not change the results.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In a population of patients who had not picked up new prescriptions after 3 calls from the pharmacy, additional nurse-directed outreach did not improve primary medication adherence. Re-engagement with the prescribing clinician may be needed to improve adherence in this patient population. The low rate of PMN in the overall population differed from prior studies in this setting and others and should be assessed in future research.

TI  - Long-term adherence to the New Nordic Diet and the effects on body weight, anthropometry and blood pressure: a 12-month follow-up study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The New Nordic Diet (NND) has induced weight loss in a 26-week controlled intervention. We aim to investigate whether high compliance and satisfaction can be maintained after the active intervention is discontinued thereby maintaining the health effects.
AB  - METHODS: After 26 weeks of intervention with NND or Average Danish Diet (ADD), 147 participants (mean age 43 years and mean BMI 29.1 kg/m2) were followed for further 52 weeks. All participants were encouraged to follow NND but without further guidance. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, study id NCT01195610.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred and ten participants (75%) completed the follow-up. Among participants previously randomised to NND (NND group), dietary compliance and satisfaction decreased from 4.3 to 3.0 and from 4.8 to 4.0, respectively (both p < 0.0001) (1-5 point scale). Among those originally randomised to ADD (ADD group), satisfaction with NND was significantly higher than with ADD during follow-up (3.3 vs. 2.5, p = 0.026). Weight losses during intervention of -6.2 kg and -3.0 kg were followed by regains of 4.6 kg (SE 0.5) and 1.1 kg (SE 0.7) for the NND group and ADD group, respectively [adjusted difference; mean (95 % CI): 1.8 kg (0.1-3.4), p = 0.041]. Across diet groups, every 1 score higher in compliance with NND was associated with 0.90 kg less body weight regain (p = 0.026) and those who increased physical activity regained 3.4 kg less compared to those who did not (p < 0.0001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: NND provides higher satisfaction, and body weight regain is reduced with higher compliance with NND and increased physical activity.

TI  - Impact of a community health workers-led structured program on blood glucose control among latinos with type 2 diabetes: the DIALBEST trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Latinos with type 2 diabetes (T2D) face major healthcare access and disease management disparities. We examined the impact of the Diabetes Among Latinos Best Practices Trial (DIALBEST), a community health worker (CHW)-led structured intervention for improving glycemic control among Latinos with T2D.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 211 adult Latinos with poorly controlled T2D were randomly assigned to a standard of healthcare (n = 106) or CHW (n = 105) group. The CHW intervention comprised 17 individual sessions delivered at home by CHWs over a 12-month period. Sessions addressed T2D complications, healthy lifestyles, nutrition, healthy food choices and diet for diabetes, blood glucose self-monitoring, and medication adherence. Demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, anthropometric, and biomarker (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profile) data were collected at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months (6 months postintervention). Groups were equivalent at baseline.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants had high HbA1c at baseline (mean 9.58% [81.2 mmol/mol]). Relative to participants in the control group, CHWs had a positive impact on net HbA1c improvements at 3 months (-0.42% [-4.62 mmol/mol]), 6 months (-0.47% [-5.10 mmol/mol]), 12 months (-0.57% [-6.18 mmol/mol]), and 18 months (-0.55% [-6.01 mmol/mol]). The overall repeated-measures group effect was statistically significant (mean difference -0.51% [-5.57 mmol/mol], 95% CI -0.83, -0.19% [-9.11, -2.03 mmol/mol], P = 0.002). CHWs had an overall significant effect on fasting glucose concentration that was more pronounced at the 12- and 18-month visits. There was no significant effect on blood lipid levels, hypertension, and weight.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: DIALBEST is an effective intervention for improving blood glucose control among Latinos with T2D.Copyright © 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

TI  - Randomized pilot trial of intensive management of blood pressure or volume expansion in subarachnoid hemorrhage (IMPROVES).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Volume expansion and hypertension are widely used for the hemodynamic management of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility, adherence, and retention in a trial of volume expansion and blood pressure manipulation to prevent delayed cerebral ischemia.
AB  - METHODS: A randomized pilot trial using a 2-way factorial design allocating patients within 72 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage to either normovolemia (NV) or volume expansion (HV) and simultaneously to conventional (CBP) or augmented blood pressure (ABP) for 10 days. The study endpoints were protocol adherence and retention to follow-up. The quality of endpoints for a larger trial were 6-month modified Rankin Scale score, comprehensive neurobehavioral assessment, delayed cerebral ischemia, new stroke, and discharge disposition.
AB  - RESULTS: Twenty patients were randomized and completed follow-up. The overall difference in daily mean intravenous fluid intake was 2099 mL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 867, 3333), HV vs NV group. The overall mean systolic blood pressure difference was 5 mm Hg (95% CI: -4.65, 14.75), ABP vs CBP group. Adverse events included death (n=1), delayed cerebral ischemia (n=1), and pulmonary complications (n=3). There were no differences in modified Rankin Scale score between HV and NV (difference 0.1; 95% CI: -1.26, 1.46, P=.87) or between ABP and CBP groups (-0.5, 95% CI: -1.78, 0.78, P=.43). Neuropsychological scores were similar between HV vs NV, but tended to be worse in ABP (57+/-27) vs CBP group (85+/-21, P=.04).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This pilot study showed adequate feasibility and excellent retention to follow-up. Given the suggestion of possible worse neurobehavioral outcome with ABP, a larger trial to determine the optimal blood pressure management in this patient population is warranted.

TI  - Reinforcing adherence to antihypertensive medications.
AB  - This pilot study evaluated a reinforcement intervention to improve adherence to antihypertensive therapy. Twenty-nine participants were randomized to standard care or standard care plus financial reinforcement for 12 weeks. Participants in the reinforcement group received a cell phone to self-record videos of adherence, for which they earned rewards. These participants sent videos demonstrating on-time adherence 97.8% of the time. Pill count adherence differed significantly between the groups during treatment, with 98.8%+/-1.5% of pills taken during treatment in the reinforcement condition vs 92.6%+/-9.2% in standard care (P<.002). Benefits persisted throughout a 3-month follow-up, with 93.8%+/-9.3% vs 78.0%+/-18.5% of pills taken (P<.001). Pill counts correlated significantly (P<.001) with self-reports of adherence, which also differed between groups over time (P<.01). Systolic blood pressure decreased modestly over time in participants overall (P<.01) but without significant time-by-group effects. These results suggest that reinforcing medication adherence via cellular phone technology and financial reinforcement holds potential to improve adherence.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Participant adherence indicators predict changes in blood pressure, anthropometric measures, and self-reported physical activity in a lifestyle intervention: HUB city steps.
AB  - The objective of this secondary analysis was to evaluate the utility of several participant adherence indicators for predicting changes in clinical, anthropometric, dietary, fitness, and physical activity (PA) outcomes in a lifestyle intervention, HUB City Steps, conducted in a southern, African American cohort in 2010. HUB City Steps was a 6-month, community-engaged, multicomponent, noncontrolled intervention targeting hypertension risk factors. Descriptive indicators were constructed using two participant adherence measures, education session attendance (ESA) and weekly steps/day pedometer diary submission (PDS), separately and in combination. Analyses, based on data from 269 primarily African American adult participants, included bivariate tests of association and multivariable linear regression to determine significant relationships between seven adherence indicators and health outcome changes, including clinical, anthropometric, dietary, fitness, and PA measures. ESA indicators were significantly correlated with four health outcomes: body mass index (BMI), fat mass, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and PA (-.29 < r < .23, p < .05). PDS indicators were significantly correlated with PA (r = .27, p < .001). Combination ESA/PDS indicators were significantly correlated with five health outcomes: BMI, percentage body fat (%BF), fat mass, LDL, and PA (r = -.26 to .29, p < .05). Results from the multivariate models indicated that the combination ESA/PDS indicators were the most significant predictors of changes for five outcomes--%BF, fat mass, LDL diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PA--while ESA performed best for BMI only. For DBP, a one-unit increase in the continuous-categorical ESA/PDS indicator resulted in 0.3 mm Hg decrease. Implications for assessing participant adherence in community-based, multicomponent lifestyle intervention research are discussed.Copyright © 2014 Society for Public Health Education.

TI  - Safety and effectiveness of a fixed-dose combination of olmesartan, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide in clinical practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials indicate that the use of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) is associated with a higher level of treatment adherence and prolonged blood pressure (BP) control. The aim of this study was to document the safety and effectiveness of the FDC olmesartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide in patients with essential hypertension in clinical practice.
AB  - METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, 24-week, noninterventional study enrolled 5,831 patients from primary care offices in Germany and Austria. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of essential hypertension and newly initiated treatment with the FDC.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 63.5 years, almost 50% of patients had a time since diagnosis of essential hypertension of over 5 years, and approximately 70% of patients had at least one cardiovascular risk factor, including 29.4% of patients with diabetes mellitus. Following approximately 24 weeks of treatment, the mean reduction in systolic/diastolic BP was 29.0/14.0 mmHg, a BP response was observed by 94.2% of patients, and a target BP of <140/90 mmHg was attained in 67.5% of patients. At least one adverse drug reaction (ADR) was experienced by 1.2% of patients, with the most common being peripheral edema. Subanalyses demonstrated that the following factors did not have a significant influence on the ADR rate: age (<65 years versus >65 years), diabetes mellitus (no/yes), cardiovascular risk (low/high), and concomitant medication (no/yes).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that in clinical practice, treatment with the three-drug combination as an FDC tablet resulted in a very high proportion of patients with a BP response and control, accompanied by a very low rate of ADRs.

TI  - The impact of health coaching on medication adherence in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of concordance between medications listed in the medical record and taken by the patient contributes to poor outcomes. We sought to determine whether patients who received health coaching by medical assistants improved their medication concordance and adherence.
AB  - METHODS: This was a nonblinded, randomized, controlled, pragmatic intervention trial. English- or Spanish-speaking patients, age 18 to 75 years, with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia were enrolled from 2 urban safety net clinics and randomized to receive 12 months of health coaching versus usual care.
AB  - RESULTS: Outcomes included concordance between medications documented in the medical record and those reported by the patient and adherence based on the patient-reported number of days (of the last 7) on which patient took all prescribed medications. The proportion of medications completely concordant increased in the coached group versus the usual care group (difference in change, 10%; P = .05). The proportion of medications listed in the chart but not taken significantly decreased in the coached group compared with the usual care group (difference in change, 17%; P = .013). The mean number of adherent days increased in the coached but not in the usual care group (difference in change, 1.08; P < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Health coaching by medical assistants significantly increases medication concordance and adherence.© Copyright 2015 by the American Board of Family Medicine.

TI  - Randomized comparison of renal denervation versus intensified pharmacotherapy including spironolactone in true-resistant hypertension: six-month results from the Prague-15 study.
AB  - This prospective, randomized, open-label multicenter trial evaluated the efficacy of catheter-based renal denervation (Symplicity, Medtronic) versus intensified pharmacological treatment including spironolactone (if tolerated) in patients with true-resistant hypertension. This was confirmed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after excluding secondary hypertension and confirmation of adherence to therapy by measurement of plasma antihypertensive drug levels before enrollment. One-hundred six patients were randomized to renal denervation (n=52), or intensified pharmacological treatment (n=54) with baseline systolic blood pressure of 159+/-17 and 155+/-17 mm Hg and average number of drugs 5.1 and 5.4, respectively. A significant reduction in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure after 6 months (-8.6 [95% cofidence interval: -11.8, -5.3] mm Hg; P<0.001 in renal denervation versus -8.1 [95% cofidence interval: -12.7, -3.4] mm Hg; P=0.001 in pharmacological group) was observed, which was comparable in both groups. Similarly, a significant reduction in systolic office blood pressure (-12.4 [95% cofidence interval: -17.0, -7.8] mm Hg; P<0.001 in renal denervation versus -14.3 [95% cofidence interval: -19.7, -8.9] mm Hg; P<0.001 in pharmacological group) was present. Between-group differences in change were not significant. The average number of antihypertensive drugs used after 6 months was significantly higher in the pharmacological group (+0.3 drugs; P<0.001). A significant increase in serum creatinine and a parallel decrease of creatinine clearance were observed in the pharmacological group; between-group difference were borderline significant. The 6-month results of this study confirmed the safety of renal denervation. In conclusion, renal denervation achieved reduction of blood pressure comparable with intensified pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Effectiveness of a tailored behavioral intervention to improve hypertension control: primary outcomes of a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - UNLABELLED: Blood pressure (BP) control rates are suboptimal. We evaluated the effectiveness of 2 behavioral interventions to improve BP control via a 3-arm, randomized controlled trial of 533 adults with repeated uncontrolled BP, despite antihypertensive drug treatment for >6 months. The interventions were a tailored stage-matched intervention (SMI) or a nontailored health education intervention (HEI) of 6 monthly calls targeting diet, exercise, and medication. Control was usual care (UC). There were no baseline group differences. Baseline BP control was 42.6%, 40.6%, and 44.6% in SMI, HEI, and UC (P=0.74), respectively; systolic BP (with SEs) was 136 (0.89), 137 (1.33), and 137 (0.96) mm Hg. Six-month control was 64.6% (SMI), 54.3% (HEI), and 45.8% (UC) (P values for pairwise comparisons versus UC, 0.001 [SMI] and 0.108 [HEI]). At 6 months, systolic BP (SE) was 131.2 (1.05), 131.8 (0.99), and 134.7 (1.02) for SMI, HEI, and UC, respectively (P values for pairwise comparisons versus UC, 0.009 for SMI and 0.047 for HEI). SMI led to lower systolic BP and better BP control than UC. SMI constitutes a new, potent approach to assist patients with uncontrolled hypertension to reach BP goals.

TI  - Understanding disparities in lipid management among patients with type 2 diabetes: gender differences in medication nonadherence after treatment intensification.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gender differences in dyslipidemia are widely documented, but the contributors to these differences are not well understood. This study examines whether differences in quality of care, intensity of lipid-lowering medication regimen, and medication adherence can explain this disparity.
AB  - METHODS: Secondary analysis of medical records data and questionnaires collected from adult patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 1,369) from seven outpatient clinics affiliated with an academic medical center as part of the Reducing Racial Disparities in Diabetes: Coached Care (R2D2C2) study. Primary outcome was low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
AB  - FINDINGS: Women had higher LDL cholesterol levels than men (mean [SD], 101.2 [35.2] vs. 92.3 [33.0] mg/dL; p < .001), but were no less likely to receive recommended processes of diabetes care, to attain targets for glycemic control and blood pressure, or to be on intensive medication regimens. More women than men reported medication nonadherence related to cost (32.7% vs. 24.2%; p = .040) and related to side effects (47.2% vs. 36.8%; p = .024). For all patients, regimen intensity (p < .05) and nonadherence related to side effects (p < .01) were each associated with higher LDL cholesterol levels. The addition of a new lipid-lowering agent was associated with subsequent nonadherence related to side effects for women (p < .001), but not for men (p = .45; test for interaction p = .048).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Despite comparable quality of diabetes care and regimen intensity for lipid management, women with diabetes experienced poorer lipid control than men. Medication nonadherence seemed to be a major contributor to dyslipidemia, particularly for women because of side effects associated with intensifying the lipid-lowering regimen.Copyright © 2015 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.

TI  - Evaluating the guideline enhancement tool (GET): an innovative clinical training tool to enhance the use of hypertension guidelines in general practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative educational intervention in enhancing clinical decision making related to the management of hypertension in general practice. The relatively low level of uptake of clinical practice guidelines by clinicians is widely recognised as a problem that impacts on clinical outcomes. This project addresses this problem with a focus on hypertension guidelines. Hypertension is the most frequently managed problem in general practice but evidence suggests that management of Hypertension in general practice is sub-optimal.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This study will explore the effectiveness of an educational intervention named the 'Guideline Enhancement Tool (GET)'. The intervention is designed to guide clinicians through a systematic process of considering key decision points related to the management of hypertension and provides a mechanism for clinicians to engage with the hypertension clinical guidelines. The intervention will be administered within the Australian General Practice Training program, via one of the regional training providers. Two cohorts of trainees will participate as the intervention and delayed intervention groups. This process is expected to improve clinicians' engagement with the hypertension guidelines in particular, and enhance their clinical reasoning abilities in general. The effectiveness of the intervention in improving clinical reasoning will be evaluated using the 'Script Concordance Test'.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The study design presented in this protocol aims to achieve two major outcomes. Firstly, the trial and evaluation of the educational intervention can lead to the development of a validated clinical education strategy that can be used in GP training to enhance the decision-making processes related to the management of hypertension. This has the potential to be adapted to other clinical conditions and training programs and can benefit clinicians in their clinical decision-making. Secondly, the study explores features that influence the effective use of clinical practice guidelines. The study thus addresses a significant problem in clinical education.

AB  - SUMMARY The paper represents the changes in the daily monitoring of blood pressure with combined drug alotendyn (bisoprolol and amlodipine). We had examined 28 patients with arterial hypertension stage II, II degree with poorly controlled blood pressure. Alotendynadministered at the dose of 5/5 (1 tablet twice daily) for 10-14 days. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of a fixed-dose combination of bisoprolol and amlodipine in patients with hypertension represented by the decrease of average SBP, DBP, heart rate, increase in the number of patients with a normal daily profile ("dipper"), decrease in the time index. The lack of adverse effects, high efficiency, good tolerance increases patients compliance to the treatment.

TI  - [Changes of twenty-four-hour profile blood pressure and its correction of patients with arterial hypertension on the background of combined antihypertensive therapy application]. [Ukrainian]
AB  - The aim of this research was the study of efficiency and endurance antihypertensive therapy on the basis of fixed combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and enalapril and HCTZ in combination with amlodipine according to the twenty-four-hour (? day-and-night) monitoring of blood pressure (? 24H BPM) of patients with arterial hypertension (AH) 2-3 severity. The study included 33 patients with 2-3 grade of hypertension (average age--54,40 +/- 3.45 years). All patients performed ? 24H BPM before treatment and after 12 weeks of therapy. The combination of enalapril and HCTZ allowed to achieve target levels of blood pressure in 79% of patients, amlodipine additional purpose--in 86% of patients. We found that this therapy has a corrective effect on daily blood pressure profile, significantly reducing the load pressure and blood pressure variability. During treatment with the combination of enalapril and HCTZ combination of enalapril, HCTZ with amlodipine optimal daily profile of blood pressure after 12 weeks of reaching respectively 63.1% and 71.4% of patients. The treatment with combination of enalapril and HCTZ and adding of amlodipine is characterized by good endurance and high adherence to treatment.

TI  - [Fixed dose combination perindopril-indapamide-amlodipine (Triplixam) for the treatment of arterial hypertension]. [French]
AB  - Triplixam is a fixed dose combination of three well known antihypertensive agents, with complementary activities, to control blood pressure in patients with arterial hypertension: perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, indapamide, a diuretic whith thiazide-like effects but also specific properties, and amlodipine, a long-acting calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine family. The potential synergic action allows better control of blood pressure with once daily administration, while limiting the incidence of adverse events. Various presentations with different dosages are available to facilitate individualized therapy. Warnings and precautions for use of every molecule should of course be respected. Such a fixed dose combination should contribute to limit clinical inertia and to improve therapeutic compliance.

TI  - [Influence of psychosocial factors on adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy: results from a Cardiovascular Health Program cohort followed in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, Chile]. [Spanish]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate blood pressure control in hypertensive patients remains a persistent health problem in Chile and worldwide. Poor adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy is one of the frequently cited factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the influence of psychosocial factors in the adherence to drug therapy in hypertensive patients followed through a Cardiovascular Health Program (CHP) that provides free access to primary care centers located in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, Chile.
AB  - METHODS: Cross sectional study. A randomized sample of 513 hypertensive patients (30 to 68 years) was obtained from a universe of 1.484 patients. Adherence to treatment was determined by the Morisky-Green-Levine test. Demographic, socioeconomic and average values of blood pressure were recorded. Validated questionnaires were utilized to assess the patient-physician relationship, awareness of being hypertensive, patient perception of social support, family cohesion, patient self-health assessment and symptoms of emotional stress and depression.
AB  - RESULTS: The drug therapy adherence was 36.6%, higher in women (38.4% vs 28.9%; p < 0.001). After multivariate analysis, absence of adherence was associated with male gender (OR: 1.76 [95% CI 1.21-2.56]), low education (OR: 1.72 [95% CI 1.18 to 2.53]), inadequate patient-physician relationship (OR: 1.56 [95% CI 1.13 to 2.27]), and high level of emotional stress and depression (OR: 1.93 [95% CI 1.27 to 2.94]).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the influence of inadequate patient-physician relation, high level of emotional stress and depression, low education level and income and male gender in the lack of adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy in hypertensive patients followed throughout the CHP.

TI  - From resistance to rescue--patients' shifting attitudes to antihypertensives: a qualitative study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of experiences of antihypertensive drug treatment.
AB  - DESIGN: Interview study.
AB  - SETTING: A primary health care centre in western Sweden.
AB  - METHOD: Qualitative interviews and analyses through systematic text condensation described by Malterud.
AB  - SUBJECTS: Ten informants in pharmacological treatment for high blood pressure (six men and four women).
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Experiences of hypertension drug treatment.
AB  - RESULTS: The findings revealed a process starting with resistance to drug treatment related to lack of control, side effects, and unwanted awareness of impaired health. These negative feelings then changed into a positive desire for lifestyle changes caused by a fear of cardiovascular disease which in turn changed the attitude towards drugs into seeing them as a rescue remedy and something normal and this then evoked health care trust.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite initial resistance to treatment, the experience of antihypertensive drug treatment became more positive with time. Confidence in the health care system is important for adherence to treatment. General practitioners have a key role in this regard.

TI  - Effects of intensive low-salt diet education on albuminuria among nondiabetic patients with hypertension treated with olmesartan: a single-blinded randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The antiproteinuric effect of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade can be magnified by dietary salt restriction. This study sought to determine the effect of intensive low-salt diet education on BP and urine albumin excretion in nondiabetic patients with hypertension and albuminuria.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This study was conducted between March of 2012 and March of 2013 as an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. After a run-in period of 8 weeks, all patients received the angiotensin II receptor blocker olmesartan (40 mg daily). Patients were then divided into two groups. One group was treated for another 8 weeks with angiotensin II receptor blocker plus conventional low-salt diet education, and the other group was treated for 8 weeks with angiotensin II receptor blocker plus intensive low-salt diet education. The final analyses was performed with 245 completed patients.
AB  - RESULTS: The amount of daily albuminuria was significantly decreased from 0 (566.0 [25.0-5398.6] mg/d) to 8 weeks (282.5 [16.1-4898.5] mg/d; P<0.001). From 8 to 16 weeks, the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was decreased by 36.0+/-5.9 mmol/d in the intensive education group and 8.8+/-4.9 mmol/d in the conventional education group (interaction P<0.001). Patients who completed intensive low-salt diet education exhibited greater decreases in urinary albumin excretion than the control group (change in albuminuria from 8 to 16 weeks, -154.0 versus 0.4 mg/d; P=0.01). Urinary albumin excretion tended to decrease as the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion amount decreased (R=0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.43; P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The 24-hour urinary albumin excretion was decreased more in patients in the intensive low-salt diet education group than patients in the conventional education group. Weekly intensive education on a low-salt diet would be a suitable method for clinical practice.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society of Nephrology.

TI  - Evaluation of an integrated adherence program aimed to increase Medicare Part D star rating measures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) Plan Quality and Performance Program, or Star Ratings Program, allows Medicare beneficiaries to compare quality of care among available Medicare Advantage prescription drug (MA-PD) plans and stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDPs). Health plans have increased intervention efforts and applied existing care management infrastructure as an approach to improving member medication adherence and subsequent Part D star rating performance. Independent Care Health Plan (iCare), an MA-PD plan; MedImpact Healthcare Systems, Inc. (MedImpact), a pharmacy benefits manager; and US MED, a mail order pharmacy, partnered to engage and enroll iCare's dual-eligible special needs population in an intervention designed to improve patient medication adherence and health plan performance for 3 Part D patient safety outcome measures: Medication Adherence for Oral Diabetes Medications (ODM), Medication Adherence for Hypertension (HTN), and Medication Adherence for Cholesterol (CHOL).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To (a) assess the effectiveness of a coordinated member-directed medication adherence intervention and (b) determine the overall impact of the intervention on adherence rates and CMS Part D star rating adherence measures.
AB  - METHODS: Administrative pharmacy claims and health plan eligibility data from MedImpact's databases were used to identify members using 3 target medication classes. Adherence was estimated by the proportion of days covered (PDC) for all members. Those members considered at high risk for nonadherence were prioritized for care management services. Risk factors were based on members' use of more than 1 target medication class, newly started therapy, and suboptimal adherence (PDC less than 80%) in the most recent 6-month period. Data files listing member adherence rates and contact information were formatted and loaded monthly into iCare's care management system, which triggered an alert for care coordinators to counsel members on the importance of adherence and offer the members an option for monthly 30-day supply medication delivery via US MED. Member adherence rates were calculated 9 months pre- and postimplementation for all members and adjusted by length of member enrollment based on CMS technical specifications. Regression analysis assessed pre-post changes in rates comparing 2 intervention groups: (1) members receiving iCare counseling only (iCare-only) and (2) members receiving counseling and medication delivery (iCare+US MED). To evaluate the overall impact of the intervention, iCare's adherence rates and iCare's measure-specific star ratings for the 2011 and 2012 calendar years (CMS measurement years) were compared with the national MA-PD plan contract average and with a health plan similar in member characteristics but without adherence intervention exposure.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 2,700 members were initially targeted for referral to iCare care management and US MED customer service specialist teams. Between April 2012 (implementation date) and January 2013, 1,302 (48.2%) members enrolled in the US MED component of the intervention. Seventy-six percent of identified members were nonadherent (PDC less than 80%) to 1 of the 3 target medication classes, and 32% of members were nonadherent to more than 1 target medication class. Pre-post absolute average adherence rates increased for the iCare-only group (ODM=15.1, HTN=10.1, CHOL=13.6) and the iCare-US MED group (ODM=30.9, HTN=25.5, CHOL=29.4).  From 2011 to 2012, iCare adherence rates increased by absolute differences of 15.2, 9.2, and 10.1 percentage points for ODM, HTN, and CHOL measures, respectively, compared with the average MA-PD plan contract differences (1.1, 2.1, and 2.5) and the comparator health plan differences (-2.7, -1.4, and -4.1). Increases in iCare's adherence rates were associated with significant increases in iCare's 2014 adherence measure star ratings (1 star to 3 stars for ODM and CHOL, 1 star to 2 stars for HTN), which contributed to increases in the Drug Plan Quality Improvement measure (2 stars to 4 stars) and iCare's overall Part D star rating (3 to 3.5 stars).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Members in this MA-PD plan dual-eligible population benefited from multiple points of contact to achieve increased adherence. Health plans can use network pharmacies, care management staff, and their pharmacy benefits managers to collaborate and implement interventions aimed to improve members' adherence to targeted maintenance medications and overall health plan quality performance and star ratings.

TI  - Rationale and design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating community health worker-based interventions for the secondary prevention of acute coronary syndromes in India (SPREAD).
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need to evaluate and implement cost-effective strategies to improve adherence to treatments in coronary heart disease. There are no studies from low- to middle income countries (LMICs) evaluating trained community health worker (CHW)-based interventions for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.
AB  - METHODS: We designed a hospital-based, open randomized trial of CHW-based interventions versus standard care. Patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were randomized to an intervention group (a CHW-based intervention package, comprising education tools to enhance self-care and adherence, and regular follow-up by the CHW) or to standard care for 12 months during which study outcomes were recorded. The CHWs were trained over a period of 6 months. The primary outcome measure was medication adherence. The secondary outcomes were differences in adherence to lifestyle modification, physiological parameters (blood pressure [BP], body weight, body mass index [BMI], heart rate, lipids), and major adverse cardiovascular events.
AB  - RESULTS: We recruited 806 patients stabilized after an ACS from 14 hospitals in 13 Indian cities. The mean age was 56.4 (+/- 11.32) years, and 17.2% were females. A high prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension (43.4%), diabetes (31.9%), tobacco consumption (35.4%), and inadequate physical activity (70.5%) was documented. A little over half had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (53.7%), and 46.3% had non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The CHW interventions and training for SPREAD have been developed and adapted for local use. The results and experience of this study will be important to counter the burden of cardiovascular diseases in low- to middle income countries.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Statin treatment patterns and clinical profile of patients with risk factors for coronary heart disease defined by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical characteristics, statin treatment patterns and adherence among patients at different risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) as defined by National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines.
AB  - METHODS: Patients > 18 years old with > 1 claim for dyslipidemia, > 1 statin claim, or > 1 LDL-C value > 100 mg/dL were identified from 1 January 2007 to 31 July 2012. Patients were classified as low risk (LR) (0-1 risk factor: hypertension, age > 45 years [men] or > 55 years [women], or low HDL-C), moderate/moderately high risk (MR) (> 2 risk factors), high risk (HR) (CHD or CHD risk equivalent), or very high risk (VHR) (acute coronary syndrome, or established cardiovascular disease plus diabetes or metabolic syndrome). Medication use and lipid levels during the 12 months before and statin use during the 6 months after index were compared across risk groups.
AB  - RESULTS: There were 1,524,351 LR, 242,357 MR, 188,222 HR, and 57,469 VHR patients identified. Statin use was observed in 15% of all patients, but was higher in the VHR group (45%) versus LR (12%), MR (18%), and HR (29%) groups. Simvastatin accounted for 50%-52% of all statin use, and average statin dose was higher among VHR patients compared with all other groups. Adherence was low overall (mean proportion of days covered [PDC]: 0.57), but higher among VHR (0.69) versus others (mean PDC: 0.55, 0.59, and 0.59 in LR, MR, and HR groups, respectively).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Statin treatment was low across all risk groups, and VHR patients had higher doses and better adherence compared with other risk groups. However, adherence was not optimal, indicating a potential limited benefit from statin treatment.

TI  - A medication adherence and persistence comparison of hypertensive patients treated with single-, double- and triple-pill combination therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fixed-dose combination therapy reduces pill burden and may, therefore, improve medication adherence and health outcomes. This study compared adherence to and persistence with single-, double-, and triple-pill treatment regimens among hypertensive patients in a US clinical practice setting.
AB  - METHODS: Adults with hypertension treated with three anti-hypertensive medications were identified. Index date was the first occurrence of a single-, double-, or triple-pill regimen with olmesartan or valsartan plus amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide from July 2010 to September 2011. Patients were followed for 12 months to assess adherence (proportion of days covered [PDC] > 80%) and time to discontinuation (medication gap > 60 days) of the index regimen. Multivariate regression models were used to compare adjusted outcomes.
AB  - RESULTS: The number of prescribed pills in the index regimen was monotonically related to adherence with 55.3%, 40.4% and 32.6% of patients having PDC > 80% in the single-, double- and triple-pill cohorts, respectively. In adjusted analysis, patients in the double- (odds ratio [OR]: 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-0.48) and triple-pill (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.22-0.30) cohorts were less likely to be adherent to their index regimens than those in the single-pill cohort. Double-pill (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.74-2.06) and triple-pill patients (HR: 2.49; 95% CI: 2.14-2.88) were more likely to discontinue treatment than single-pill patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Greater pill burden was directly and significantly associated with decreased adherence and persistence with antihypertensive therapies in real-practice settings. Use of fixed-dose combinations that reduce pill burden could help patients to continue treatment and may result in improved clinical outcomes. Typical of observational studies, the potential for residual confounding of adherence estimates remains due to lack of randomization of treatment groups.

TI  - Audit of healthy lifestyle behaviors among patients with diabetes and hypertension attending ambulatory health care services in the United Arab Emirates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge is limited on healthy lifestyle behaviors and their associations with glycemic and blood pressure control among patients with diabetes and hypertension in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine healthy lifestyle behaviors and their associations with glycemic and blood pressure control among patients with hypertension and diabetes, and improvement after the implementation of an intervention in a Chronic Disease Program.
AB  - SUBJECTS: All patients with diabetes or hypertension attending seven primary health care centers in Al Ain, UAE during a designated three-week period in July and August 2009.
AB  - METHOD: Nurses conducted an audit of patients' adherence to health lifestyle behaviors related to meal planning, smoking, exercise, blood glucose and blood pressure monitoring at home, and foot and eye exams in the Chronic Disease Program clinics after a self-management intervention. A perceived knowledge score and discussion scores (based on the frequency the patients discuss diabetes and hypertension management issues with their providers) were calculated. Data were analyzed using linear regression and odds ratios.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients reported acceptable rates of adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors, including a low smoking rate (6% in males), following a meal plan and exercising (88.6% and 78.7%, respectively). Among patients with diabetes, 59% tested their blood glucose levels at least once a week compared to only 15.3% of those with hypertension monitoring their blood pressure levels at home. Only 33% of the participants were following the current physical activity recommendations. Healthy lifestyle behaviors fell into the following clusters: meal planning with exercise (odds ratio (OR): 8.9 [3.3-23.7]), meal planning with foot exams (OR: 10.6 [3.4-32.9]) and exercising and foot exams (OR: 5.2 [1.9-14.2]).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This practice-based audit provides an essential assessment for future interventions to improve adherence to healthy life style behaviors among patients with diabetes and hypertension attending primary health clinics in the UAE.Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.

TI  - [Medication adherence with the fixed combination of ramipril and amlodipine]. [Hungarian]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adequate patient adherence has outstanding importance during the management of chronic disorders including hypertension. In particular, target blood pressure and reduction of cardiovascular risk can be reached only by prolonged, effective pharmacotherapy. Hypertension is known as one of the most significant cardiovascular risk factors. According to international data, antihypertensive therapy with a fixed combination improves patient adherence by about 20 per cent in comparison with free combinations.
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the persistence on one-year treatment with the free or fixed combination of ramipril and amlodipine, administered for the indication of hypertension.
AB  - METHOD: Information from the National Health Insurance Found prescriptions database, on pharmacy-claims between October 1, 2012 and September 30, 2013 was analyzed. The authors identified patients who filled prescriptions for fixed or free combinations of ramipril and amlodipine, prescribed for the first time, for the therapeutic indication of hypertension. The subjects have not received antihypertensive therapy with similar active substances during the year preceding the study. Using the Kaplan-Meier technique, the authors constructed persistence curves with a 95% confidence interval for point estimates calculated on a log scale. Patients who were still persistent at the closing date of the study were considered censored. For modeling of the curves, the authors used semi-parametric Cox's regression where antihypertensive therapy was the only (categorical) explanatory variable, and the patients taking the fixed combination were regarded as the reference group.
AB  - RESULTS: During the study period, combination antihypertensive therapy with ramipril and amlodipine was started with a free or a fixed combination of these agents in 20,096 and 10,449 patients, respectively. One-year persistence rate in patients taking ramipril and amlodipine as a free combination was 34%, whereas 54% in those on the fixed combination. This 20 percent difference means that the rate of persistence was higher by 58.8/2%. Considering only the 360-day study period, the mean duration of persistence was 272 days in patients on the fixed, and 206 days in those taking the free combination. Analyzing persistence on treatment with these combinations showed that the actual rate of discontinuation was about twice higher during treatment with the free, compared with the use of the fixed combination (hazard ratio = 1.94, p<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study, which is unique even by international standards, demonstrated the clear benefit of initiating antihypertensive therapy with the fixed combination of ramipril and amlodipine over starting treatment with the free combination. In particular, the chance of discontinuation during a one-year treatment with the former was approximately half of that seen with the latter. Inadequately controlled hypertension is a significant cardiovascular risk factor. The markedly higher persistence of patients on therapy with the fixed combination of ramipril and amlodipine can lead to a reduction in cardiovascular risk, which might prove - on the longer term - a positive outcome of public health significance.

TI  - Characteristics, management modalities and outcome in chronic systolic heart failure patients treated in tertiary care centers: results from the EVIdence based TreAtment in Heart Failure (EVITA-HF) registry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited data exist regarding baseline characteristics and management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF) in tertiary care facilities.
AB  - METHODS: EVITA-HF comprises web-based case report data on demography, comorbidities, diagnostic and therapy measures, quality of life, adverse events and 1-year follow-up of patients hospitalized for chronic heart failure and an ejection fraction of less than 40%.
AB  - RESULTS: Between February 2009 and June 2011, a total of 1,853 consecutive, hospitalized patients (pts) were included in 16 centers in Germany. Mean age was 70 years, 76% were male. Median EF was 30%, and 63% were in NYHA III/IV. Ischemic cardiomyopathy was present in 56%, history of hypertension in 76%, diabetes in 39%, impaired renal function in 33%, thyroid dysfunction in 12%, and malignoma in 7%. Sixty-eight percent of pts had a non-elective admission. Rhythm was sinus/atrial fibrillation or flutter/pacemaker in 64, 28 and 11%, respectively. Median heart rate amounted to 80 bpm, median blood pressure to 122/74 mmHg. LBBB was present in 26% of non-pacemaker pts. Eighteen percent had an ICD or CRT-D. Medication (admission vs. discharge) consisted of ACEI or ARB in 73 vs. 88%, beta-blocker in 71 vs. 89%, mineral corticosteroid receptor antagonist (MRA) in 32 vs. 57%, diuretics in 68 vs. 83% (p < 0.001 for each). Forty-two percent of pts received a specific treatment procedure beyond pharmacotherapy, of these 48% revascularization, 39% device therapy, 14% electrical cardioversion, 5% ablation procedures, 9 % valvular procedures, 6% iv inotropes, 1.8% IABP or LVAD implantation. At discharge, 33% of survivors had ICD- or CRT-D implants. One-year mortality amounted to 16.8%, and death or rehospitalization to 56%. NYHA class III/IV was found in 30% (p < 0.001 vs. index admission), general health status was improved in 45% and unchanged in 36% of patients. Eighty-five percent of pts took ACEI or ARB, 86% beta-blockers, 47% MRA, and 78% diuretics (p < 0.001 vs. index discharge for all).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic heart failure and low ejection fraction represent an elderly and multimorbid population. While hospitalized, they experience a significant optimization of prognosis-relevant medication, revascularization and device therapy. After 1 year, mortality is moderate; drug adherence is high and NYHA status favourable. The EVITA-HF registry is able to reflect coherently the real-world management, efforts and follow-up in heart failure pts managed in tertiary care facilities.

TI  - Safety and adherence of Umezu polyphenols in the Japanese plum (Prunus mume) in a 12-week double-blind randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial to evaluate antihypertensive effects.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Medications or lifestyle changes to prevent or improve hypertension often press considerable efforts on patients suffering from mild hypertension. Capsules including Umezu polyphenols (UP), polyphenols in Japanese plums, may help them to control their blood pressure (BP). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of UP on BP and its safety.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 15 healthy workers without antihypertensive medication who had some concerns about their BP, preferably normal-high BP or hypertension level 1, were randomized in a double-blind manner into UP ingesting and placebo groups. Each subject was instructed to take four capsules daily for 12 weeks (daily UP dose, 800 mg for the UP ingesting group; and 0 mg for the placebo group). These subjects were followed for 12 weeks, and their BP both at home and at the examination site, as well as self-perceived quality-of-life outcomes and possible side effects, was monitored during that period. Group x time interactions on BP changes were examined.
AB  - RESULTS: All of the 15 subjects completed the 12-week intervention trial. The BP changes did not significantly differ between the UP ingesting and placebo groups, neither at the examination site nor at home. But during the study period, no adverse effects were observed.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: No remarkable effect of UP on BP was observed. However, a higher dose of UP was confirmed safe and high in adherence in this 12-week randomized controlled trial. Its effect on BP and other outcomes shall be confirmed in a larger sample.

TI  - Hypertension management in primary care: how effective is a telephone recall for patients with low appointment adherence in a practice setting?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies showed a positive association between appointment adherence and blood pressure control. In randomized-controlled trials blood pressure therapy was improved by recall systems. We analyze the effectiveness of an active telephone recall on blood pressure control for patients with low appointment adherence in regular primary care.
AB  - METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyses all hypertensive patients without any hypertension-related disease (primary prevention) of an academic teaching primary care practice using a structured hypertension management. Blood pressure levels at the beginning of the hypertension management and after 1 year were analyzed. Blood pressure control rates (< 140/90 mmHg) and average blood pressure of patients with good appointment adherence and those requiring a phone recall were compared.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 410 hypertensive patients were identified. A telephone recall was required in 22 % (n = 92), which was successful in 87 % of patients (n = 80). At the beginning, 66 % of appointment adherent patients had controlled hypertension which increased to 81 % after 1 year. In patients not adhering to appointments the initial blood pressure control rate was 59 % and improved to 74 % after 1 year. Average blood pressure office readings decreased from 141/90 to 136/86 mmHg (p < 0.05) in those adhering to appointments, while it improved from 146/92 to 138/88 mmHg (p < 0.05) in those requiring recall.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Active telephone recall improved blood pressure control of hypertensive patients with low appointment adherence in regular primary care. An active recall can be recommended for other primary care scenarios.

TI  - Target versus actual oxygenation index at initiation of inhaled nitric oxide in neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure: survey results from 128 patient cases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a well-established treatment for neonatal hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF). However, iNO therapy initiation criteria have not been standardized. This report describes a follow-up survey administered to neonatologists who had completed an Awareness, Trial, and Usage Survey. The objectives were to compare stated target oxygenation index (OI) versus actual OI at which iNO is initiated in respondents' patients and identify factors associated with iNO initiation at other levels.
AB  - METHODS: Neonatologists provided iNO-treated HRF patient data. Target and actual OI at initiation were determined. Patient groups were stratified by actual OI deviation from target [<4; at (+/-3); above: 4-10, 11-20, >20; not measured]. Reasons for above-target OI were determined.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 83 invited neonatologists, 26 (31%) participated, providing data for 128 patients; 85/128 patients (66%) had OI measured at initiation with neonatologist-stated mean target OI 18.8+/-5.8. Actual mean OI was 26.2+/-10.3. iNO was initiated < target in 30/85 patients (35%); most [55/85 (65%)] had iNO initiated when OI was above target. Patients aged <1 day and those receiving a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 1.0 for more than 1 h had highest OIs at initiation.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Among surveyed neonatologists who treat infants with HRF with pulmonary hypertension (PH), there is a disparity between stated target versus actual OI for iNO initiation, particularly among infants <1 day old and those receiving FiO2 of 1.0 for more than 1 h. In term/near-term neonates with HRF with PH, neonatologists should consider implementing treatment protocols to ensure iNO initiation at stated target OI levels.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of a multipronged intervention to improve blood pressure control among stroke survivors in Nigeria.
AB  - RATIONALE: Stroke is the second-leading cause of death in low- and middle-income countries, but use of evidence-based therapies for stroke prevention in such countries, especially those in Africa, is extremely poor. This study is designed to enhance the implementation and sustainability of secondary stroke-preventive services following hospital discharge.
AB  - AIM/HYPOTHESIS: The primary study aim is to test whether a Chronic Care Model-based initiative entitled the Tailored Hospital-based Risk reduction to Impede Vascular Events after Stroke (THRIVES) significantly improves blood pressure control after stroke.
AB  - DESIGN: This prospective triple-blind randomized controlled trial will include a cohort of 400 patients with a recent stroke discharged from four medical care facilities in Nigeria. The culturally sensitive, system-appropriate intervention comprises patient report cards, phone text messaging, an educational video, and coordination of posthospitalization care.
AB  - STUDY OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is improvement of blood pressure control. Secondary endpoints include control of other stroke risk factors, medication adherence, functional status, and quality of life. We will also perform a cost analysis of THRIVES from the viewpoint of government policy-makers.
AB  - DISCUSSION: We anticipate that a successful intervention will serve as a scalable model of effective postdischarge chronic blood pressure management for stroke in sub-Saharan Africa and possibly for other symptomatic cardiovascular disease entities in the region.Copyright © 2014 World Stroke Organization.

TI  - Home BP monitoring using a telemonitoring system is effective for controlling BP in a remote island in Japan.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess whether a home blood pressure (HBP) telemonitoring system could improve BP control and overcome the problems of HBP monitoring in a remote location. The authors enrolled 60 subjects and randomized them to either a Telemonitoring group or a Control group. The outcomes were changes in HBP level, adherence to HBP monitoring, and visual analog scale (VAS; score 0-100) as a measure of the motivation to perform HBP measurements. The reductions in morning systolic BP (-5.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg vs 0.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg, P < .001) and evening systolic BP (-4.6 +/- 1.0 mm Hg vs 1.0 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, P < .001) and the change in VAS (12.8 +/- 3.3 vs -1.6 +/- 2.2, P = .001) were significantly greater in the Telemonitoring group than in the Control group. The measure of the adherence to HBP monitoring tended to be better (P = .064) in the Telemonitoring group than in the Control group. These results indicate that an HBP telemonitoring system would be a beneficial healthcare measure in remote geographical locations.Copyright ©2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Hyperinflation on chest radiograph as a marker of low adherence to positive airway pressure therapy in the overlap syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Positive airway pressure (PAP) in subjects with both obstructive sleep apnea and COPD reduces the risk of pulmonary hypertension, death, and hospitalizations from COPD exacerbations, but adherence to the intervention is low, similar to the experience with noninvasive ventilation in stable COPD. We sought to assess whether hyperinflation on chest radiographs contributes to low adherence to PAP therapy in the overlap syndrome.
AB  - METHODS: Records of patients with a listed diagnosis of COPD at the time of polysomnography were reviewed. Overlap syndrome was diagnosed when COPD was clinically confirmed with spirometry showing a fixed airway obstruction and when the apnea-hypopnea index was > 5. Hyperinflation was evaluated by a review of the right diaphragm height on a lateral chest radiograph. Adherence was assessed clinically or through device download at a 3-month follow-up, and later adherence was assessed by telephone interviews. A receiver operating curve was used to determine whether diaphragm height was associated with adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Twenty-one of 41 subjects (51%) were considered adherent to PAP therapy at the 3-month visit. Adherent subjects were more overweight compared with non-adherent subjects (body mass index of 36.0 +/- 5.7 vs 32.0 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2), P = .03), sleepier at the onset (Epworth sleepiness scale score of 13.0 +/- 5.8 vs 9.4 +/- 5.4, P < .05), and less likely to have hyperinflation as defined by a right diaphragm height < 2.45 cm (33% vs 65%, P = .04). The body mass index and initial sleepiness no longer predicted adherence beyond 3 months, but 35% of subjects with a right diaphragm height < 2.45 cm were adherent beyond 3 months compared with 75% of those with a right diaphragm height > 2.45 cm (P = .04 by Fisher exact test).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Hyperinflation is associated with decreased adherence to PAP therapy in the overlap syndrome.

TI  - CPAP treatment supported by telemedicine does not improve blood pressure in high cardiovascular risk OSA patients: a randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with hypertension, which is one of the intermediary mechanisms leading to increased cardiovascular morbidity. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of a combination of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and telemedicine support on blood pressure (BP) reduction in high cardiovascular risk OSA patients.
AB  - DESIGN: A multi-center randomized controlled trial that compared standard CPAP care and CPAP care and a telemedicine intervention.
AB  - SETTING: Sleep clinics in France.
AB  - PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: 107 adult (18-65 years old) OSA patients (AHI > 15 events/h) with a high cardiovascular risk (cardiovascular SCORE > 5% or secondary prevention).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to either standard care CPAP (n = 53) or CPAP and telemedicine (n = 54). Patients assigned to telemedicine were equipped with a smartphone for uploading BP measurements, CPAP adherence, sleepiness, and quality of life data; in return, they received pictograms containing health-related messages.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome was home self-measured BP and secondary outcomes were cardiovascular risk evolution, objective physical activity, CPAP adherence, sleepiness and quality of life.
AB  - RESULTS: Self-measured BP did not improve in either group (telemedicine or standard care). Patients in primary prevention showed greater BP reduction with CPAP treatment than those in secondary prevention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: CPAP treatment supported by telemedicine alone did not improve blood pressure and cardiovascular risk in high cardiovascular risk OSA patients. This study emphasizes the need for diet and physical activity training programs in addition to CPAP when aiming at decreasing cardiometabolic risk factors in these patients.

TI  - The thrill of success: central arterial-venous anastomosis for hypertension.
AB  - Excess blood pressure remains the most important risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease. Poly pharmacy has been proved safe and effective under clinical trial circumstances; however, the majority of patients fail to sustain pharmaceutical persistence and adherence. The opportunity to offer patients a treatment or device in addition or perhaps instead of drug therapy alone may significantly broaden the options for patients and allow greater success in hypertensive therapy. In this review, we examine the potential of a fixed-volume central arterial-venous anastomosis to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients, review possible mechanisms by which the anastomosis may reduce blood pressure, and consider the unique clinical trial opportunities posed by this therapy.

TI  - Multicentre randomised controlled study comparing carvedilol with variceal band ligation in the prevention of variceal rebleeding.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Rebleeding after an initial oesophageal variceal haemorrhage remains a significant problem despite therapy with band ligation, non-selective beta-blockers or a combination of these. Carvedilol is a vasodilating non-selective beta-blocker with alpha-1 receptor and calcium channel antagonism. A recent study has suggested it is effective in the prevention of a first variceal bleed. Our aim was to compare oral carvedilol with variceal band ligation (VBL) in the prevention of rebleeding following a first variceal bleed.
AB  - METHODS: Patients who were stable 5 days after presentation with a first oesophageal variceal haemorrhage and had not been taking beta-blockers were randomised to oral carvedilol or VBL. Patients were followed-up after one week, monthly, then every 3 months. The primary end point was variceal rebleeding on intention-to-treat analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: 64 patients were randomised, 33 to carvedilol and 31 to VBL. 58 (90.6%) patients had alcohol related liver disease. Age and Child-Pugh score were similar in both groups at baseline. Median follow-up was 26.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 10.2-46.6)months. Compliance was 68% and 65% for carvedilol and VBL respectively (p=0.993) and serious adverse events between the two groups were similar (p=0.968). Variceal rebleeding occurred during follow-up in 12 (36.4%) and 11 (35.5%) patients in the carvedilol and VBL groups, respectively (p=0.857), with 9 (27.3%) and 16 (51.6%) deaths in each group, respectively (p=0.110).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Carvedilol is not superior to VBL in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. The trend to a survival benefit for patients taking this drug compared with those undergoing banding requires further exploration.Copyright © 2014 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

TI  - [Correction of endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during combined antihypertensive therapy]. [Russian]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the impact of 6-month antihypertensive therapy with the combined drug amlodipine + lisinopril (ekvator) on endothelial dysfunction (ED) and carbohydrate metabolic parameters in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation enrolled 30 patients aged 40-65 years with Stages II-III hypertension concurrent with type 2 DM. All the patients received combined antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine + lisinopril for 24 weeks. Endothelial function (EF) was studied from the serum and urine concentrations of the metabolites nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) and from occlusion test results. Carbohydrate metabolic parameters were estimated. Insulin resistance (IR) was judged from basal insulin concentrations, followed by the calculations of the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index.
AB  - RESULTS: Following 24 weeks of therapy with amlodipine + lisinopril and close adherence to dietary recommendations, all the patients achieved the target levels of blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). There was a significant improvement in EF in hypertensive patients with type 2 DM: NO production was increased in both the serum and urine (by 122.8 and 65.8%, respectively). ET-1 secretion was naturally decreased in both the serum and urine (by 26.1 and 76.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). Analysis of the vascular component of EF during treatment with the combined drug amlodipine + lisinopril revealed a statistically significant patient redistribution by the types of microcirculation and the results of an occlusion test, by calculating the responsiveness of large arteries: the number of patients with normal microcirculation increased from 13.3 to 86.7% and that of patients with hyperemic microcirculation declined from 66.7 to 0. The number of patients with a paradoxical occlusion test significantly reduced from 46.7% at baseline to 20% after 24 weeks of treatment with the combined medication amlodipine + lisinopril. Fasting blood glucose levels and HOMA index were decreased by 22.1 and 22.4%, respectively (p < 0.05). There were statistically significant correlations between the HOMA index and the concentrations of NO in the urine (r = -0.45) and blood (r = -0.54) and those of ET-1 in the blood (r = -0.54).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Twenty-four-week combined antihypertensive therapy with the drug amlodipine + lisinopril is safe and highly effective in EF recovery and favorably affects carbohydrate metabolic parameters in the hypertensive patients with type 2 DM.

TI  - A prospective clinical trial of specialist renal nursing in the primary care setting to prevent progression of chronic kidney: a quality improvement report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection and effective management of risk factors can potentially delay progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage kidney disease, and decrease mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular (CV) disease. We evaluated a specialist nurse-led intervention in the primary care setting to address accepted risk factors in a study sample of adults at 'high risk of CKD progression', defined as uncontrolled type II diabetes and/or hypertension and a history of poor clinic attendance.
AB  - METHODS: The study was a non-controlled quality improvement study with pre- and post- intervention comparisons to test feasibility and potential effectiveness. Patients within two primary care practices were screened and recruited to the study. Fifty-two patients were enrolled, with 36 completing 12-months follow-up. The intervention involved a series of sessions led by the nephrology Nurse Practitioner with assistance from practice nurses. These sessions included assessment, education and planned medication and lifestyle changes. The primary outcome measured was proteinuria (ACR), and the secondary outcomes estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 5-year absolute CV risk. Several 'intermediary' secondary outcomes were also measured including: blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), prevalence of active smoking, a variety of self-management domains, and medication prescription. Analysis of data was performed using linear and logistic regression as appropriate.
AB  - RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in ACR (average decrease of -6.75 mg/mmol per month) over the course of the study. There was a small but significant decrease in eGFR and a reduction in 5 year absolute CV risk. Blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, and HbA1c all decreased significantly. Adherence to lifestyle advice improved with a significant reduction in prevalence of active smoking, although there was no significant change in BMI. Self-management significantly improved across all relevant domains.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a collaborative model of care between specialist renal nurses and primary care clinicians may improve the management of risk factors for progression of CKD and CV death. Further larger, controlled studies are warranted to definitively determine the effectiveness and costs of this intervention.

TI  - Self-monitoring of blood pressure for improving adherence to antihypertensive medicines and blood pressure control: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring is reported to have limited efficacy for hypertension management in high-income countries. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of self-monitoring on blood pressure (BP) control in an Iranian population.
AB  - METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 196 mild to moderate hypertensive patients in an outpatient cardiovascular clinic. Patients in the intervention group received a wrist self-monitoring device and were educated to measure and document their BP daily during the study period (24 weeks). Patients in the control group received usual care. Three follow-up visits with the physician were scheduled for all patients (weeks 4, 12, and 24), and the investigator assessed adherence to medications after each visit (pill counting). The primary outcome (BP) was compared between groups using repeated-measure analysis of variance.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred ninety patients completed the study. Systolic BP (144.4+/-7.4 vs 145.9+/-6.4mm Hg) and diastolic BP (85.5+/-6.9 vs. 85.1+/-7.7mm Hg) were similar between groups at baseline. The trend of BP was not significantly different between groups during the study period. Systolic and diastolic BP decreased significantly in both groups at the first follow-up visit (systolic BP: 132.6 vs. 133.4mm Hg; diastolic BP: 77.4 vs. 77.2mm Hg). In the intervention group, we observed a small continued decrease in diastolic BP up to week 24 BP (P = 0.01). Both groups showed adherence rates >95% during the study period.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our study could not confirm that self-monitoring can improve BP control in patients with frequent medical visits.Copyright © American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2014. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.

TI  - Effects of DASH diet on lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted with 48 women diagnosed with PCOS. The women were randomly assigned to consume either the control (n = 24) or DASH diet (n = 24) for 8 wk. Both diets were designed to be calorie-restricted. Both diets consisted of 52% carbohydrates, 18% proteins, and 30% total fats. The DASH diet was designed to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and to be low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and refined grains. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 8-wk intervention to measure lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total glutathione (GSH).
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence to the DASH diet, compared with the control diet, resulted in a significant decrease in weight (-4.4 versus -1.5 kg; P < 0.001) and body mass index (-1.7 versus -0.6 kg/m(2); P < 0.001), decreased serum triglycerides (-10.0 versus +19.2 mg/dL; P interaction = 0.005) and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (-2.0 versus +3.9 mg/dL; P interaction = 0.005). Increased concentrations of TAC (+98.6 versus -174.8 mmol/L; P interaction <0.001) and GSH (+66.4 versus -155.6 mumol/L; P interaction = 0.005) also were found in the DASH group compared with the control group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Consumption of DASH diet for 8 wk led to a significant reduction in serum insulin, triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a significant increase in TAC and GSH levels.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Utah Remote Monitoring Project: improving health care one patient at a time.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The expanding role of technology to augment diabetes care and management highlights the need for clinicians to learn about these new tools. As these tools continue to evolve and enhance improved outcomes, it is imperative that clinicians consider the role of telemonitoring, or remote monitoring, in patient care. This article describes a successful telemonitoring project in Utah.
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a nonrandomized prospective observational preintervention-postintervention study, using a convenience sample. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes and/or hypertension from four rural and two urban primary care clinics and one urban stroke center participated in a telemonitoring program. The primary clinical outcome measures were changes in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and blood pressure. Other outcomes included fasting lipids, weight, patient engagement, diabetes knowledge, hypertension knowledge, medication adherence, and patient perceptions of the usefulness of the telemonitoring program.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean A1C decreased from 9.73% at baseline to 7.81% at the end of the program (P<0.0001). Systolic blood pressure also declined significantly, from 130.7 mm Hg at baseline to 122.9 mm Hg at the end (P=0.0001). Low-density lipoprotein content decreased significantly, from 103.9 mg/dL at baseline to 93.7 mg/dL at the end (P=0.0263). Other clinical parameters improved nonsignificantly. Knowledge of diabetes and hypertension increased significantly (P<0.001 for both). Patient engagement and medication adherence also improved, but not significantly. Per questionnaires at study end, patients felt the telemonitoring program was useful.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring improved clinical outcomes and may be a useful tool to help enhance disease management and care of patients with diabetes and/or hypertension.

TI  - Real-world clinical experience of amlodipine/valsartan and amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in hypertension: the EXCITE study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The EXCITE (clinical EXperienCe of amlodIpine and valsarTan in hypErtension) study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability and adherence of amlodipine/valsartan (Aml/Val) and amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Aml/Val/HCT) single-pill combination therapies in patients with hypertension from the Middle East and Asia studied in routine clinical practice.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective, multinational, non-interventional real-world study in which adult patients with hypertension receiving treatment with Aml/Val or Aml/Val/HCT as part of routine clinical practice were observed for a period of 26+/-8 weeks. Dosages in milligrams (prescribed in accordance with local prescribing information) were Aml/Val: 5/80, 5/160, 10/160, 5/320 or 10/320; Aml/Val/HCT: 5/160/12.5, 10/160/12.5, 5/160/25, 10/160/25 or 10/320/25.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment effectiveness was assessed by change from baseline in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (BP)/diastolic BP (msSBP/msDBP), and the proportion of patients achieving therapeutic goal and BP response. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 9794 patients analyzed (mean age 53.2 years), 8603 received Aml/Val and 1191 Aml/Val/HCT. At study end (26+/-8 weeks), overall msSBP (95% confidence interval [CI]) reductions from baseline were -31.0 (-31.42, -30.67) mmHg for Aml/Val and -36.6 (-37.61, -35.50) mmHg for Aml/Val/HCT; msDBP reductions from baseline were -16.6 (-16.79, -16.34) mmHg for Aml/Val and -17.8 (-18.41, -17.22) mmHg for Aml/Val/HCT. Meaningful reductions in BP from baseline were also consistently observed across all Aml/Val dosages and severities of hypertension. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 11.2% and 6.1% of patients in the Aml/Val and Aml/Val/HCT groups, respectively. Most frequently reported AEs in the Aml/Val and Aml/Val/HCT groups were edema and peripheral edema. While the observational design of the study has inherent limitations, it enables collection of real-world data from a more naturalistic clinical setting, and the large size of the study increases the robustness of the study, as indicated by the narrow confidence intervals for the main study outcomes.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The EXCITE study provides evidence that Aml/Val and Aml/Val/HCT provide clinically meaningful BP reductions and are well tolerated in a large multi-ethnic hypertensive population studied in routine clinical practice.

TI  - Impact of socio-economic factors on the long-term effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment with an angiotensin II receptor blocker: an observational study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of socio-economic factors on the therapeutic effectiveness of and therapeutic adherence to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) olmesartan (OM) alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of arterial hypertension.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multi-center, open-label, prospective and long-term observational study, data from hypertensive patients treated with OM were analyzed at baseline, month 3 and month 12 within the context of patients' socio-economic status (SES), determined using pre-defined criteria by physicians in outpatient practices and including multivariate analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Overall, 7724 patients were assigned to three subgroups representing low, medium and high socio-economic status. Baseline conditions differed significantly between the subgroups. Patients of low SES had worse nutritional habits, less physical activity and more concomitant medication compared to patients of high SES. Cardiovascular risk factors were more common in the low SES group as were concomitant diseases such as heart failure, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis and renal failure. OM therapy led to a significant decrease in blood pressure (23.0/11.6mmHg) in all patients. The blood pressure target of <140/90mmHg was achieved in about 70% of the documented population. Effectiveness was comparable between patients with low, medium or high SES. Treatment adherence was high in the overall population with only minor differences between the subgroups. In total the incidence of adverse events (AEs) was 1.6% documented in 98 patents (1.3%) during the course of the study. Of this total number only 1.0% was related to the drug, matching the percentage expressed in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The ARB OM is effective and well tolerated in all patients, irrespective of their socio-economic status. The risk status and the established cardiovascular disease of hypertensive patients are strongly influenced by the SES. To validate these interesting data a randomized controlled trial is needed.

TI  - Rationale, design, and implementation of a cluster randomized trial using certified diabetes educators to intensify treatment for glycemia, blood pressure and lipid control: REMEDIES 4D.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence supports that adequate treatment of hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension can reduce morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes, however achieving treatment goals remains elusive. The majority of diabetes care occurs in the primary care setting; however there are often missed opportunities for timely intervention during office visits. This paper describes a systematic redesign of current diabetes treatment in primary care by implementing evidence-based protocols.
AB  - MATERIALS/METHODS: This is a cluster randomized controlled trial using certified diabetes educators (CDEs) to intensify therapeutic management. Fifteen primary care practices from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center were recruited. Practices were randomized to intervention (implementation of diabetes management protocols) or usual care. Eligibility criteria included diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at least one year prior to baseline and an A1C > 7%, LDLc > 100 mg/dl or blood pressure > 130/80 mmHg which were the goal levels established by the American Diabetes Association at study inception. Treatment was intensified according to preapproved protocols. Participants also received diabetes education during their visits. Research assessments were done at baseline, three, six and twelve months. Clinical visits were scheduled between research visits, as needed, to adjust medications. Primary outcomes were achievement of glycemic, blood pressure, or lipid control goals. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, medication and diabetes care satisfaction, medication adherence, and cost-effectiveness.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study will provide the evidence to support expanded roles for CDEs in primary care. Using this model to deliver diabetes care may offer a more cost-effective approach for diabetes management.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Study protocol of EMPOWER participatory action research (EMPOWER-PAR): a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial of multifaceted chronic disease management strategies to improve diabetes and hypertension outcomes in primary care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic disease management presents enormous challenges to the primary care workforce because of the rising epidemic of cardiovascular risk factors. The chronic care model was proven effective in improving chronic disease outcomes in developed countries, but there is little evidence of its effectiveness in developing countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the EMPOWER-PAR intervention (multifaceted chronic disease management strategies based on the chronic care model) in improving outcomes for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension using readily available resources in the Malaysian public primary care setting. This paper presents the study protocol.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial using participatory action research is underway in 10 public primary care clinics in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Five clinics were randomly selected to provide the EMPOWER-PAR intervention for 1 year and another five clinics continued with usual care. Each clinic consecutively recruits type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria over a 2-week period. The EMPOWER-PAR intervention consists of creating/strengthening a multidisciplinary chronic disease management team, training the team to use the Global Cardiovascular Risks Self-Management Booklet to support patient care and reinforcing the use of relevant clinical practice guidelines for management and prescribing. For type 2 diabetes mellitus, the primary outcome is the change in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c<6.5%. For hypertension without type 2 diabetes mellitus, the primary outcome is the change in the proportion of patients achieving blood pressure <140/90 mmHg. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients achieving targets for serum lipid profile, body mass index and waist circumference. Other outcome measures include medication adherence levels, process of care and prescribing patterns. Patients' assessment of their chronic disease care and providers' perceptions, attitudes and perceived barriers in care delivery and cost-effectiveness of the intervention are also evaluated.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Results from this study will provide objective evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention based on the chronic care model in resource-constrained public primary care settings. The evidence should instigate crucial primary care system change in Malaysia.

TI  - Developing an interactive mobile phone self-report system for self-management of hypertension. Part 1: patient and professional perspectives.
AB  - Low adherence remains a struggle in hypertension management, despite improvement efforts. Presuming that increased patient participation is a possible approach, we collaborated with patients and healthcare professionals to design a self-report system to support self-management. The study aimed to explore and describe relevant aspects of hypertension and hypertension treatment, for use in the development of an interactive mobile phone self-report system. It further aimed to suggest which clinical measures, lifestyle measures, symptoms and side-effects of treatment would be meaningful to include in such a system. Five focus group interviews were performed with 15 patients and 12 healthcare professionals, and data was analysed using thematic analysis. Patients suggested trust, a good relationship with caregivers, and well-being as important aspects of hypertension self-management. Furthermore, they regarded blood pressure, dizziness, stress, headache and tiredness as important outcomes to include. Patients sought to understand interconnections between symptoms and variations in blood pressure, whilst healthcare professionals doubted patients' ability to do so. Healthcare professionals emphasized accessibility, clear and consistent counselling, complication prevention and educational efforts. The study presents aspects of importance for follow-up to understand the interplay between blood pressure and daily life experiences for patients with hypertension.

TI  - Impact of a pill box clinic to improve systolic blood pressure in veterans with uncontrolled hypertension taking 3 or more antihypertensive medications.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two-thirds of Americans who are prescribed antihypertensive medications are not at a blood pressure (BP) goal of <140/90 mmHg, and low adherence is identified as a primary cause of inadequate control. Improved adherence to antihypertensive medications has been shown to enhance BP control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications. This study investigated the effectiveness of a pill box clinic to improve BP in veterans with uncontrolled hypertension taking 3 or more antihypertensive medications.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To (a) investigate the reduction of systolic BP by 10 mmHg from pre-intervention to post-intervention (primary outcome) and (b) investigate the percentage of patients meeting goal blood pressure--as defined by The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7)--and percentage of patient adherence to antihypertensive medications (secondary outcomes).
AB  - METHODS: Patients with uncontrolled hypertension currently taking at least 3 antihypertensive medications were enrolled in this prospective pre/post study. Under the supervision of a pharmacist, each patient was provided two 7-day pill boxes to organize all antihypertensive medications. In addition, baseline BP and previous history of nonadherence were documented. Following the initial encounter, patients attended 2 follow-up appointments, at 2 and 4 weeks, for refill of pill boxes, BP measurement, and adherence assessment. A chi-square test was used for categorical outcomes and logistic regression for nominal outcomes as well as descriptive statistics, as appropriate.
AB  - RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled, with 50 completing appointments 1 and 2, and 45 completing all 3 appointments. Of those, 24% and 31% achieved at least a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic BP from baseline to appointments 2 and 3, respectively (P=0.438). Systolic BP readings for appointments 1, 2, and 3 were not statistically significant (mean [SD]: 134.1 [11.8], 131.9 [9.4], and 130.6 [11.4], respectively). Goal BP per JNC7 was achieved by 44% and 51% of patients at appointments 2 and 3, respectively, compared with baseline (P=0.201). All patients had >80% adherence to antihypertensive medications, assessed via pill counts at the second and third appointments.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Although results were not statistically significant, the pill box clinic resulted in clinically significant reductions in systolic BP by 10 mmHg, as well as an increased number of patients meeting prescribed BP goals.

TI  - A multifaceted pharmacist intervention to improve antihypertensive adherence: a cluster-randomized, controlled trial (HAPPy trial).
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVES: About half of all patients taking antihypertensives discontinue treatment by 12 months. There is potential for substantial health gains at both individual and population levels through improved treatment adherence. The objective was to evaluate a community pharmacist intervention to improve adherence with antihypertensive medicines with a view to improving blood pressure (BP) control.
AB  - METHODS:
AB  - DESIGN: prospective, non-blinded, cluster-randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: adults with primary hypertension who obtained antihypertensives in the previous 6 months. Patients with poor refill adherence were preferentially identified with the help of a purpose-built software application.
AB  - INTERVENTION: package comprising BP monitor; training on BP self-monitoring; motivational interviewing; medication use review; prescription refill reminders.
AB  - FOLLOW-UP: six months.
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOME: change in proportion self-reporting medication adherence. Secondary outcome: BP changes.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants (n = 395; intervention - 207; control - 188) had a mean age of 66.7 years; 51.1% were males. The proportion of adherent participants increased in both groups but was not significantly different between groups [57.2% to 63.6% (control) vs. 60.0% to 73.5% (intervention), P = 0.23]. The mean reduction in systolic BP was significantly greater in the intervention group (10.0 mmHg vs. 4.6 mmHg; P = 0.05). The proportion of patients who were non-adherent at baseline and adherent at 6 months was 22.6% (95%CI 5.1-40.0%) higher in the intervention group (61.8% vs. 39.2%, P = 0.007). Among participants with baseline BP above target, reduction of systolic BP was significantly greater in the intervention group [by 7.2 mmHg (95%CI 1.6-12.8 mmHg); (P = 0.01)]. Among participants non-adherent at baseline and above target BP, the proportion reporting adherence at 6 months was significantly greater in the intervention group [56.8% vs. 35.9%, P = 0.039).
AB  - WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This community pharmacist intervention resulted in improved adherence to antihypertensive medication and reduced systolic BP.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Relationships among stressful life events and physiological markers, treatment adherence, and psychosocial functioning among youth with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships between stressful life events and physiological measures, adherence to prescribed oral medication regimens, depressive symptoms, and impaired quality of life (QoL) in adolescents with recent-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D).
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected from 497 ethnically diverse participants (66% female) in the final year of the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth multicenter clinical trial. Exposure to 32 possible events over the previous year and rating of subsequent distress were collected by self-report and summarized as a major stressors score. This score was analyzed for relationship to glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c and treatment failure), body mass index, diagnosis of hypertension or triglyceride dyslipidemia, adherence to a prescribed oral medication regimen, presence of depressive symptoms, and impaired QoL.
AB  - RESULTS: The total number of major stressful life events in the adolescents with T2D was calculated, with 33% reporting none, 67% reporting > 1, 47% reporting > 2, 33% reporting > 3, and 20% reporting > 4. There were no associations between the major stressors score and physiological measures or diagnosis of comorbidities. The odds of medication nonadherence increased significantly from those reporting > 1 major stressor (OR, 1.58; P = .0265) to those reporting > 4 major stressors (OR, 2.70; P = .0009). Significant odds of elevated depressive symptoms and impaired QoL were also found with increased reporting of major stressors.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Exposure to major stressful life events is associated with lower adherence to prescribed oral medication regimens and impaired psychosocial functioning in adolescents with T2D.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Simulating the impact of improved cardiovascular risk interventions on clinical and economic outcomes in Russia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Russia faces a high burden of cardiovascular disease. Prevalence of all cardiovascular risk factors, especially hypertension, is high. Elevated blood pressure is generally poorly controlled and medication usage is suboptimal. With a disease-model simulation, we forecast how various treatment programs aimed at increasing blood pressure control would affect cardiovascular outcomes. In addition, we investigated what additional benefit adding lipid control and smoking cessation to blood pressure control would generate in terms of reduced cardiovascular events. Finally, we estimated the direct health care costs saved by treating fewer cardiovascular events.
AB  - METHODS: The Archimedes Model, a detailed computer model of human physiology, disease progression, and health care delivery was adapted to the Russian setting. Intervention scenarios of achieving systolic blood pressure control rates (defined as systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg) of 40% and 60% were simulated by modifying adherence rates of an antihypertensive medication combination and compared with current care (23.9% blood pressure control rate). Outcomes of major adverse cardiovascular events; cerebrovascular event (stroke), myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death over a 10-year time horizon were reported. Direct health care costs of strokes and myocardial infarctions were derived from official Russian statistics and tariff lists.
AB  - RESULTS: To achieve systolic blood pressure control rates of 40% and 60%, adherence rates to the antihypertensive treatment program were 29.4% and 65.9%. Cardiovascular death relative risk reductions were 13.2%, and 29.6%, respectively. For the current estimated 43,855,000-person Russian hypertensive population, each control-rate scenario resulted in an absolute reduction of 1.0 million and 2.4 million cardiovascular deaths, and a reduction of 1.2 million and 2.7 million stroke/myocardial infarction diagnoses, respectively. Averted direct costs from current care levels ($7.6 billion [in United States dollars]) were $1.1 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.

TI  - The effect of a community-based self-help multimodal behavioral intervention in Korean American seniors with high blood pressure.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Great strides have been made in improving heart health in the United States during the last 2 decades, yet these strides have not encompassed many ethnic minority populations. There are significant health disparity gaps stemming from both a paucity of valid research and a lack of culturally sensitive interventions. In particular, many Korean Americans with chronic illnesses encounter difficulty navigating the healthcare system because of limited health literacy.
AB  - METHODS: The effect of a multimodal Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of High Blood Pressure (HBP) was tested in a community-based clinical trial for Korean American seniors. Of 440 seniors enrolled, 369 completed the study (184 in the intervention group and 185 in the control group; mean age = 70.9+/-5.3 years). The intervention group received 6 weekly educational sessions on HBP management skill building, including health literacy training, followed by telephone counseling and home blood pressure (BP) monitoring for 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Findings support that the Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of HBP was effective in controlling BP in this ethnic/linguistic minority population. The BP control rates for the intervention and control groups were 49.5% vs. 43.2% at baseline, 58.5% vs. 42.4% at 6 months, 67.9% vs. 52.5% at 12 months, and 54.3% vs. 53.0% at 18 months. Significant changes were observed over time in some psychobehavioral outcomes, including self-efficacy for BP control, medication adherence behavior, HBP knowledge, and depression.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that the multimodal Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of HBP is effective at promoting optimal HBP control for this ethnic/linguistic minority population.

TI  - Effect of a low-fat or low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet on markers of cardiovascular risk among premenopausal women: a randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-fat and low-carbohydrate weight-loss diets can have a beneficial effect on longitudinal measures of blood pressure and blood lipids. We aimed to assess longitudinal changes in blood pressure and blood lipids in a population of premenopausal women. We hypothesized that results may differ by level of adherence to the respective diet protocol and baseline presence of hypertension or hyperlipidemia.
AB  - METHODS: Overweight or obese premenopausal women were randomized to a low-fat (n=41) or low-carbohydrate (n=38) diet. As part of the 52-week Lifestyle Eating and Fitness (LEAF) intervention trial, we fit linear mixed models to determine whether a change in outcome differed by treatment arm.
AB  - RESULTS: Within-group trends in blood pressure and blood lipids did not differ (p>0.30). Across study arms, there was a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP, 3mm Hg, p=0.01) over time, but diastolic blood pressure (DBP) did not change significantly over the course of the study. Blood lipids (total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoproteins [LDL], and high-density lipoproteins [HDL]) all exhibited nonlinear trends over time (p<0.01); each decreased initially but returned to levels comparable to baseline by study conclusion (p>0.20). We observed a decline in SBP among women who were hypertensive at baseline (p<0.01), but hypercholesterolemia at baseline did not affect trends in blood lipids (p>0.40).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that dietary interventions may be efficacious for lowering blood pressure and blood lipids among overweight or obese premenopausal women. However, a decrease in SBP was the only favorable change that was sustained in this study population. These changes can be maintained over the course of a 1-year intervention, yet changes in blood lipids may be less sustainable.

TI  - Lowering blood pressure to prevent stroke recurrence: a systematic review of long-term randomized trials. [Review]
AB  - Albeit hypertension is a leading risk factor for an initial stroke, the role of blood pressure (BP) lowering to prevent a subsequent stroke is controversial. The present systematic review searched randomized trials published from January 1990 to January 2014 with the aim to assess antihypertensive treatment effects on recurrent stroke prevention. Seven randomized placebo-controlled trials enrolling 49,518 patients, two randomized trials not placebo controlled comparing antihypertensive drugs, and one randomized trial that compared the effects of intensive systolic BP lowering with a more conservative systolic BP management, were identified. The placebo-controlled trials had substantial methodological differences, explaining the difficulties to compare their results. An important obstacle arises from the large dispersion in the window's time between the qualifying stroke and randomization. Another barrier is the variation among studies in the recruited patient's stroke subtypes. Differences between trials could not be attributed to disparity in lowering BP or to different degrees of no adherence. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association stated that although an absolute target of BP level has not been clearly defined, a reduction in recurrent stroke has been associated with an average lowering of 10/5 mm Hg. It should be taken into account that it is not advisable to reduce BP levels to <120/80 mm Hg. It should carry out an individualized selection, based on demographic characteristics and comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic disease) among diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or calcium channel blockers.

TI  - Comprehensive approach for hypertension control in low-income populations: rationale and study design for the hypertension control program in Argentina. [Review]
AB  - Although the efficacy and effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive pharmaceutical treatment for the prevention and control of hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular disease have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, this scientific knowledge has not been fully applied in the general population, especially in low-income communities. This article summarizes interventions to improve hypertension management and describes the rationale and study design for a cluster randomized trial testing whether a comprehensive intervention program within a national public primary care system will improve hypertension control among uninsured hypertensive men and women and their families. We will recruit 1,890 adults from 18 clinics within a public primary care network in Argentina. Clinic patients with uncontrolled hypertension, their spouses and hypertensive family members will be enrolled. The comprehensive intervention program targets the primary care system through health care provider education, a home-based intervention among patients and their families (home delivery of antihypertensive medication, self-monitoring of blood pressure [BP], health education for medication adherence and lifestyle modification) conducted by community health workers and a mobile health intervention. The primary outcome is net change in systolic BP from baseline to month 18 between intervention and control groups among hypertensive study participants. The secondary outcomes are net change in diastolic BP, BP control and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. This study will generate urgently needed data on effective, practical and sustainable intervention programs aimed at controlling hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular disease in underserved populations in low- and middle-income countries.

TI  - Blood pressure control in hypertensive patients in the "Hiperdia Program": a territory-based study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic hypertension is highly prevalent and an important risk factor for cardiovascular events. Blood pressure control in hypertensive patients enrolled in the Hiperdia Program, a program of the Single Health System for the follow-up and monitoring of hypertensive patients, is still far below the desired level.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological profile and to assess blood pressure control of patients enrolled in Hiperdia, in the city of Novo Hamburgo (State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil).
AB  - METHODS: Cross-sectional study with a stratified cluster random sample, including 383 adults enrolled in the Hiperdia Program of the 15 Basic Health Units of the city of Porto Alegre, conducted between 2010 and 2011. Controlled blood pressure was defined as < 140 mmHg x 90 mmHg. The hypertensive patients were interviewed and their blood pressure was measured using a calibrated aneroid device. Prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence interval, Wald's chi(2) test, and simple and multiple Poisson regression were used in the statistical analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean age was 63 +/- 10 years, and most of the patients were females belonging to social class C, with a low level of education, a sedentary lifestyle, and family history positive for systemic hypertension. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was observed in 31%; adherence to the antihypertensive treatment in 54.3%; and 33.7% had their blood pressure controlled. DM was strongly associated with inadequate BP control, with only 15.7% of the diabetics showing BP considered as controlled.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Even for hypertensive patients enrolled in the Hiperdia Program, BP control is not satisfactorily reached or sustained. Diabetic hypertensive patients show the most inappropriate BP control.

TI  - Characterizing workers participating in a worksite wellness health screening program using blood pressure control, self-monitoring, medication adherence, depression, and exercise.
AB  - Blood pressure control remains a serious public health issue because hypertension is the most common risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Effective management of hypertension often requires lifestyle modification and medication adherence. The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of blood pressure control, medication adherence, self-monitoring of blood pressure, depression, and exercise among workers with access to health resources. Faculty and staff (N = 484) from a university and health care institution in the southeastern United States participated in biometric and questionnaire screening. The researchers used initial screening data from this worksite wellness program to describe baseline blood pressure control (< 140/90 mm Hg), self-monitoring of blood pressure, medication adherence, depression, and exercise. Overall, 63% of the workers' blood pressure was controlled; however, 23% of the sample had been prescribed antihypertensive medication to control their blood pressure. Thirty percent of the sample reported practicing blood pressure self-monitoring, 72.2% reported that they exercised, and 22% reported feeling down and depressed. More than half (64.9%) who used prescribed antihypertensive medication reported adherence to these medications.Copyright 2014, SLACK Incorporated.

TI  - Aliskiren alone or with other antihypertensives in the elderly with borderline and stage 1 hypertension: the APOLLO trial.
AB  - AIMS: We studied the unclear question whether blood pressure (BP) lowering reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD) in elderly individuals with systolic BP <160 mm Hg.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We initiated a randomized placebo-controlled stratified 2 x 2 factorial clinical trial evaluating the effects of BP lowering in 11 000 elderly individuals with systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 130 and 159 mm Hg, for 5 years. Following 5-week active run-in, participants were randomized to aliskiren (300 mg) or placebo, and to an additional antihypertensive [hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) or amlodipine (5 mg)], or their respective placeboes. Study was terminated by sponsor after 1759 subjects (age 72.1 +/- 5.2 years, 88% receiving at least one antihypertensive) were randomized and followed for 0.6 year. Study drugs were well tolerated with few serious adverse events during run-in and after randomization, with no significant differences between treatment groups. By design, three levels of BP reductions were achieved, adjusted mean BP reductions of 3.5/1.7 mm Hg (P < 0.001) by aliskiren, 6.8/3.3 mm Hg (P < 0.001) by hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine, and 10.3/5.0 mm Hg (P < 0.001) by double therapy compared with placebo. Twenty-five major CVD events occurred. Non-significant trends towards fewer CVD events with greater BP reductions are evident: hazard ratios (HR) 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37-1.81] for 3.5 mm Hg SBP reduction; HR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.19-1.04) for 6.8 mm Hg; and HR 0.25 (0.05-1.18) for 10.3 mm Hg reduction for primary composite of CV death, MI, stroke, or significant heart failure.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Sizeable reductions in BP, with potential for substantial CVD reduction, can be safely achieved using combinations of BP drugs in the elderly with normal high and Stage 1 hypertension.

TI  - Effects on office and home blood pressure of the lercanidipine-enalapril combination in patients with Stage 2 hypertension: a European randomized, controlled clinical trial.[Erratum appears in J Hypertens. 2014 Oct;32(10):2106]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combinations of lercanidipine (L) and enalapril (E) at different doses on office and home blood pressure (BP) in patients with Stage 2 hypertension.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, factorial study conducted in 100 centres from seven countries. Patients with office DBP 100-109 mmHg and home DBP at least 85 mmHg at the end of a 2-week placebo run-in period were randomized to a 10-week treatment with placebo, L (10 or 20 mg), E (10 or 20 mg) or the four L-E combinations. The efficacy parameters were office DBP at trough (primary), SBP at trough and home SBP and DBP. Office BP was measured at each visit in both the sitting and the standing position, while home BP was measured twice in the morning and twice in the evening for at least 3 days before treatment and at study end. Safety parameters included adverse events, laboratory tests and 12-lead ECG.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 1039 patients were randomized (48% men, mean age 54 years, mean BMI 30 kg/m, 40% obese patients). Baseline BP was similar in all groups and lower for home than for office values (149/95 and 159/103 mmHg, respectively). A marked placebo effect was observed on office but not on home BP. Combination therapy was superior to placebo at all doses for both office and home BP. The greatest effect was observed in the L20/E20 group, in which the SBP/DBP fall amounted to -19.2/-15.2 and -13.2/-7.5 mmHg for sitting office and home BP, respectively. Similar reductions were observed on standing office BP. The L20/E20 combination was associated with less cough, palpitations and leg oedema than monotherapies, with no increased rate of dizziness or hypotension.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In Stage 2 hypertension, a fixed-dose combination of L and E ensures a control of both office and out-of-office BP, with a favourable tolerability profile.

TI  - The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet affects inflammation in childhood metabolic syndrome: a randomized cross-over clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet on inflammation in childhood metabolic syndrome (MetS) have still to be identified.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of the DASH diet on markers of systemic inflammation in adolescents with MetS.
AB  - METHODS: In this randomized, cross-over clinical trial, 60 postpubescent girls with MetS were randomly assigned to receive either the DASH diet menu cycles or usual dietary advice (UDA) for 6 weeks. After a 4-week washout period, participants were crossed over to the alternate arm. The DASH diet was designed to maintain the current body weight. This diet contained high amounts of fruit, vegetables and low-fat dairy products and was low in saturated fats and cholesterol. UDA consisted of general oral advice and written information about healthy food choices based on the Healthy Eating Plate. Compliance to the DASH diet was assessed through quantification of plasma vitamin C levels. Fasting venous blood samples were taken 4 times from each participant: at baseline and at the end of each study arm. Circulating levels of biomarkers of systemic inflammation were quantified according to standard protocols.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean (SD) age and weight of participants was 14.2 years (1.7) and 69 kg (14.5), respectively. Serum vitamin C levels tended to increase during the DASH phase compared with the UDA phase (16.8 +/- 12.9 vs. -13.8 +/- 9.7 ng/dl, respectively, p = 0.06) indicating a relatively good compliance to the DASH diet. Adherence to the DASH diet, compared to the UDA, had a significant effect on serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (p = 0.002). This effect remained significant even after adjustment for weight changes and after further controlling for changes in lipid profiles. We did not observe any significant effect of intervention on levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6 and adiponectin, in either the crude or adjusted models. There were no significant group*time interactions for any dependent variable, except for IL-6; this was close to the significant level.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In summary, consumption of the DASH eating pattern for 6 weeks may reduce circulating levels of hs-CRP among adolescents with MetS. Other inflammatory markers were not affected by the DASH diet.

TI  - A cluster-randomized trial of task shifting and blood pressure control in Ghana: study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are experiencing an epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD) propelled by rapidly increasing rates of hypertension. Barriers to hypertension control in SSA include poor access to care and high out-of-pocket costs. Although SSA bears 24% of the global disease burden, it has only 3% of the global health workforce. Given such limited resources, cost-effective strategies, such as task shifting, are needed to mitigate the rising CVD epidemic in SSA. Ghana, a country in SSA with an established community health worker program integrated within a national health insurance scheme provides an ideal platform to evaluate implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) task-shifting strategy. This study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the implementation of the WHO Package targeted at CV risk assessment versus provision of health insurance coverage, on blood pressure (BP) reduction.
AB  - METHODS: Using a cluster randomized design, 32 community health centers (CHCs) and district hospitals in Ghana will be randomized to either the intervention group (16 CHCs) or the control group (16 CHCs). A total of 640 patients with uncomplicated hypertension (BP 140-179/90-99 mm Hg and absence of target organ damage) will be enrolled in this study (20 patients per CHC). The intervention consists of WHO Package of CV risk assessment, patient education, initiation and titration of antihypertensive medications, behavioral counseling on lifestyle behaviors, and medication adherence every three months for 12 months. The primary outcome is the mean change in systolic BP from baseline to 12 months. The secondary outcomes are rates of BP control at 12 months; levels of physical activity, percent change in weight, and dietary intake of fruits and vegetables at 12 months; and sustainability of intervention effects at 24 months. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, six months and 12 months. Trained community health nurses will deliver the intervention as part of Ghana's community-based health planning and services (CHPS) program.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will provide policy makers and other stakeholders needed information to recommend scalable and cost-effective policy with respect to comprehensive CV risk reduction and hypertension control in resource-poor settings.

TI  - Executive summary: Football for health - prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases across the lifespan through football.
AB  - This supplement contains 16 original articles describing how football conducted as small sided games affects fitness and health of untrained individuals across the lifespan. The intermittent nature of football and high exercise intensity result in a broad range of effects. The heart changes its structure and improves its function. Blood pressure is markedly reduced with the mean arterial blood pressure being lowered by ~10 mmHg for hypertensive men and women training 2-3 times/week for 12-26 weeks. Triglycerides and cholesterol are lowered and body fat declines, especially in middle-aged men and women with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, muscle mass and bone mineral density increases in a number of participant groups, including 65-75-year-old men. The functional capacity is elevated with increases in VO2 max of 10-15%, and 50-100% improvements in the capacity to perform intermittent work within 16 weeks. These effects apply irrespective of whether the participants are young, overweight, elderly or suffering from a disease. The studies clearly show that the participants enjoy playing football and form special relationships with their team mates. Thus, football is a healthy activity, providing a unique opportunity to increase recruitment and adherence to physical activity in a hitherto underserved population, and to treat and rehabilitate patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes and prostate cancer.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TI  - Youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus: lessons learned from the TODAY study.
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly diagnosed in obese children and adolescents. Evidence suggests that this disease commonly progresses more rapidly in youth compared with adults and is associated with high rates of early microalbuminuria, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study was the first multiethnic, multicenter randomized trial in the United States to compare 3 treatment approaches in obese youth with new-onset type 2 diabetes (n=699; ages 10-17 years): monotherapy with metformin, metformin with rosiglitazone, and metformin with an intensive lifestyle intervention. The primary outcome was glycemic control. Diabetes-related complications and cardiovascular risk factors were also examined. Approximately half of the participants could not maintain glycemic control by using metformin alone. Combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone resulted in better durability of glycemic control, and metformin plus intensive lifestyle intervention was intermediate but not superior to metformin alone. Deterioration in glycemic control was associated with rapid loss of beta cell function, not worsened insulin sensitivity, and could not be explained by differences in adherence or body mass index. After 3.9 years, 236 (33.8%) of participants had hypertension and 116 participants (16.6%) had microalbuminuria. Only 55.9% of participants had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 100 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) after 3 years, and 71 of 517 participants (13.7%) had retinopathy. The significance of the findings from this important trial for the management of youth and young adults with youth-onset type 2 diabetes and its complications is discussed. An aggressive multifaceted approach is needed to prevent or forestall premature microvascular and macrovascular complications in youth-onset type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Do gender differences in primary PCI mortality represent a different adherence to guideline recommended therapy? a multicenter observation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether gender differences in outcome after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are only attributable to different baseline characteristics or additional factors.
AB  - METHODS: Databases of two German myocardial infarction network registries were combined with a total of 1104 consecutive patients admitted with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and treated according to standardized protocols.
AB  - RESULTS: Approximately 25% of patients were females. Mean age (69 vs 61 years), incidence of diabetes (28% vs 20%), hypertension (68 vs 58%) and renal insufficiency (26% vs 19%) was significantly higher compared to males. Mean prehospital delay was numerically longer in females (227 vs 209 min) as was in hospital delay (35 vs 30 min). PCI was finally performed in 92% of females and 95% of males with comparable procedural success (95% vs 97%). Use of drug eluting stents (55% vs 68%) and application of GP 2b 3a blockers (75% vs 89%) was significantly less frequent in women. At discharge, prescription of beta blockers and lipid lowering drugs was also significantly lower in females (84% vs 90% and 71% vs 84%). Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in females (10% vs 5%) without attenuation after 12 months. Adjusted mortality however did not differ significantly between genders.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Higher unadjusted mortality in females after primary PCI was accompanied by significant differences in baseline characteristics, interventional approach and secondary prophylaxis in spite of the same standard of care. Lower guideline adherence seems to be less gender specific but rather a manifestation of the risk-treatment paradox.

TI  - An investigation of associations between clinicians' ethnic or racial bias and hypertension treatment, medication adherence and blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have directly investigated the association of clinicians' implicit (unconscious) bias with health care disparities in clinical settings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinicians' implicit ethnic or racial bias is associated with processes and outcomes of treatment for hypertension among black and Latino patients, relative to white patients.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Primary care clinicians completed Implicit Association Tests of ethnic and racial bias. Electronic medical records were queried for a stratified, random sample of the clinicians' black, Latino and white patients to assess treatment intensification, adherence and control of hypertension. Multilevel random coefficient models assessed the associations between clinicians' implicit biases and ethnic or racial differences in hypertension care and outcomes.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Standard measures of treatment intensification and medication adherence were calculated from pharmacy refills. Hypertension control was assessed by the percentage of time that patients met blood pressure goals recorded during primary care visits.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight primary care clinicians and 4,794 patients with hypertension participated. Black patients received equivalent treatment intensification, but had lower medication adherence and worse hypertension control than white patients; Latino patients received equivalent treatment intensification and had similar hypertension control, but lower medication adherence than white patients. Differences in treatment intensification, medication adherence and hypertension control were unrelated to clinician implicit bias for black patients (P = 0.85, P = 0.06 and P = 0.31, respectively) and for Latino patients (P = 0.55, P = 0.40 and P = 0.79, respectively). An increase in clinician bias from average to strong was associated with a relative change of less than 5 % in all outcomes for black and Latino patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Implicit bias did not affect clinicians' provision of care to their minority patients, nor did it affect the patients' outcomes. The identification of health care contexts in which bias does not impact outcomes can assist both patients and clinicians in their efforts to build trust and partnership.

TI  - CPAP versus oxygen in obstructive sleep apnea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with hypertension, inflammation, and increased cardiovascular risk. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces blood pressure, but adherence is often suboptimal, and the benefit beyond management of conventional risk factors is uncertain. Since intermittent hypoxemia may underlie cardiovascular sequelae of sleep apnea, we evaluated the effects of nocturnal supplemental oxygen and CPAP on markers of cardiovascular risk.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in which patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors were recruited from cardiology practices. Patients were screened for obstructive sleep apnea with the use of the Berlin questionnaire, and home sleep testing was used to establish the diagnosis. Participants with an apnea-hypopnea index of 15 to 50 events per hour were randomly assigned to receive education on sleep hygiene and healthy lifestyle alone (the control group) or, in addition to education, either CPAP or nocturnal supplemental oxygen. Cardiovascular risk was assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of the study treatment. The primary outcome was 24-hour mean arterial pressure.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 318 patients who underwent randomization, 281 (88%) could be evaluated for ambulatory blood pressure at both baseline and follow-up. On average, the 24-hour mean arterial pressure at 12 weeks was lower in the group receiving CPAP than in the control group (-2.4 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.7 to -0.1; P=0.04) or the group receiving supplemental oxygen (-2.8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.1 to -0.5; P=0.02). There was no significant difference in the 24-hour mean arterial pressure between the control group and the group receiving oxygen. A sensitivity analysis performed with the use of multiple imputation approaches to assess the effect of missing data did not change the results of the primary analysis.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP, but not nocturnal supplemental oxygen, resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure.

TI  - Taste acceptability of pulverized brand-name and generic drugs containing amlodipine or candesartan.
AB  - Trials with pulverized brand-name antihypertensive drugs suggest that, from the perspective of taste acceptability, crushed candesartan, chlortalidon, hydrochlorothiazide, lercanidipine and lisinopril should be preferred to pulverized amlodipine, atenolol, bisoprolol, enalapril, irbesartan, losartan, ramipril, telmisartan and valsartan. Brand-name antihypertensive drugs and the corresponding generic medicines have never been compared with respect to their taste acceptability. We therefore investigated among healthy health care workers the taste acceptability of a pulverized 1 mg-test dose of the brand-name and two generics containing either the dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker amlodipine (Norvasc(), Amlodipin-Mepha() and Amlodipin Pfizer()) or the angiotensin receptor antagonist candesartan (Atacand(), Cansartan-Mepha() and Pemzek()). For this purpose, a smiley-face scale depicting four degrees of pleasure was used. Between November and December 2013, the taste test was performed among 19 nurses (15 female and 4 male subjects) and 12 physicians (5 female and 7 male subjects) aged between 25 and 49 years. Pulverized brand-names and generics containing either amlodipine or candesartan did not differ with respect to their taste acceptability.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Clinical impact of patient adherence to a fixed-dose combination of olmesartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent findings from randomized clinical trials indicate an improved patient adherence and blood pressure (BP) control by using fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) in the treatment of hypertension. The aim of the present study was to verify those data in a large real-world sample of hypertensive patients and to cross-check adherence evaluation performed by physicians and patients self-assessment.
AB  - METHODS: A European multi-center, prospective, 24-week, non-interventional study was conducted including 14,979 patients with essential hypertension and new treatment with olmesartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide as an FDC. Patients' adherence was measured using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and a non-standardized questionnaire was used by physicians and patients for self-assessment.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 63.9+/-11.78 years and 46.5% were women. One or more cardiovascular risk factors were present in 71.9% of patients and 94.7% had been treated for hypertension before study entry. Mean adherence to medication by MMAS-8 improved from 6.0 to 6.9 at study end. Corresponding improvements of adherence were seen on physicians' and patients' self-assessments throughout the study. Mean decrease of systolic/diastolic BP was 26.4/12.8 mmHg without a relevant difference between the MMAS-8 adherence levels. BP target achievement improved from 55.3 to 67.7% in patients with low versus high adherence. The overall rate of patients with adverse drug reactions was very low (1.76%) but more frequent in patients with low adherence.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm previous clinical trial data on the improvement of medication adherence by switching antihypertensive combination therapy to an FDC and a subsequent improvement in BP target achievement. An observed trend toward a reduction in adverse drug reactions needs to be further investigated in clinical trials.

TI  - Process evaluation of a promotora de salud intervention for improving hypertension outcomes for Latinos living in a rural U.S.-Mexico border region.
AB  - Hypertension is a growing public health problem for U.S.-Mexico border Latinos, who commonly experience low levels of awareness, treatment, and control. We report on a process evaluation that assessed the delivery of Corazon por la Vida, a 9-week promotora de salud-led curriculum to help Latinos manage and reduce hypertension risks in two rural/frontier counties in the New Mexico border region. Ninety-six adults participated in the program, delivered in three waves and in three communities. We assessed program delivery and quality, adherence, exposure, and participant responsiveness. Participant outcome measures included self-reported eating and physical activities and assessment of community resources. Findings suggest that the program was fully delivered (99%) and that most participants (81.7%) were very satisfied with the educational sessions. The average participant attendance for educational sessions was 77.47%. We found significant differences in self-reported behavioral changes depending on the number of sessions completed: The higher the dose of sessions, the better the self-reported outcomes. These findings suggest that a promotora-led curriculum may be useful for promoting self-management of chronic disease in rural/frontier border Latino populations. Future evaluation should focus on training and implementation adaptations within evidence-based chronic disease programs for diverse Latino communities.

TI  - Perceived discrimination and medication adherence in black hypertensive patients: the role of stress and depression.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between perceived discrimination and medication adherence among black people with hypertension and the role of stress and depressive symptoms in this relationship. Perceived racial discrimination has been associated with poor health outcomes in blacks; its relationship to medication adherence among hypertensive patients remains untested.
AB  - METHODS: We measured perceived racial discrimination at baseline, stress and depressive symptoms at 6 months, and medication adherence at 12 months among patients enrolled in a 30-site cluster-randomized controlled trial testing a patient and physician-targeted intervention to improve blood pressure. A mediational method with bootstrapping (stratified by site) confidence intervals was used to estimate the indirect association between perceived discrimination and medication adherence through stress and depression.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 1056 patients from 30 sites enrolled in the trial, 463 had complete data on all four measures at 6 and 12 months and were included in the analyses. Adjusting for clustering, perceived discrimination was associated with poor medication adherence (B = 0.138, p = .011) at 12 months, and with stress (B = 2.24, p = .001) and depression (B = 1.47, p = .001) at 6 months. When stress and depression were included in the model, there was a 65% reduction in the total association of perceived discrimination with medication adherence, and the relationship was no longer significant (B = 0.049, p = .35).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Perceived discrimination is associated with poor medication adherence among hypertensive blacks, and stress and depressive symptoms may account for this relationship.

TI  - More rigorous protocol adherence to intensive structured management improves blood pressure control in primary care: results from the Valsartan Intensified Primary carE Reduction of Blood Pressure study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine protocol adherence to structured intensive management in the Valsartan Intensified Primary carE Reduction of Blood Pressure (VIPER-BP) study involving 119 primary care clinics and 1562 randomized participants.
AB  - METHODS: Prospective criteria for assessing adherence to treatment prescription, uptitration, and visit attendance at 6, 10, 14, and 18 weeks postrandomization were applied to 1038 intervention participants. Protocol adherence scores of 1-5 (least to most adherent) were compared to blood pressure (BP) control during 26 weeks of follow-up.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean age was 59.3 +/- 12.0 years, 963 (62%) were men, and 1045 (67%) had longstanding hypertension. Clinic attendance dropped from 91 (week 6) to 83% (week 26) and pharmacological instructions were followed for 93% (baseline) to 61% at week 14 (uptitration failures commonly representing protocol deviations). Overall, 26-week BP levels and BP target attainment ranged from 132 +/- 14/79 +/- 9 and 51% to 141 +/- 15/83 +/- 11  mmHg and 19% in those participants subject to the highest (n = 270, 26%) versus least (n = 148, 14%) per protocol adherence, respectively; adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.22 per unit protocol adherence score, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.31; for achieving BP target (P < 0.001). Participants with a per protocol score of 4 or 5 (512/1038, 49.3%) were 1.54-fold (95% CI 1.31-1.81; P < 0.001) more likely to achieve their individual BP target compared with usual care. Clinics equipped with a practice nurse significantly influenced protocol adherence (adjusted RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.37; P = 0.004) and individual BP control (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04-1.41; P = 0.015).
AB  - CONCLUSION: There is considerable potential for structured care management to improve BP control in primary care, especially when optimally applied.

TI  - Efficacy of a nurse-led email reminder program for cardiovascular prevention risk reduction in hypertensive patients: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many strategies have been evaluated to improve the prevention and control of cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors. Nursing telephonic and tele-counseling individualized lifestyle educational programs have been found to improve blood pressure control and adherence to lifestyle recommendation. This study tested the efficacy of a nurse-led reminder program through email (NRP-e) to improve CVD risk factors among hypertensive adults.
AB  - METHODS: All participants received usual CVD prevention and a guideline-based educational program. Subjects in the NRP-e group also received weekly email alerts and phone calls from a nurse care manager for 6 months. Emails contained a reminder program on the need for adherence with a healthy lifestyle based upon current guidelines. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 3 and 6 months after enrollment; randomization was made centrally and blood samples were evaluated into a single laboratory.
AB  - RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 98 (control) and 100 (NRP-e) subjects (mean age 59.0 +/- 14.5 years; 51.0% males). After 6 months, the following CVD risk factors significantly improved in both groups: body mass index, alcohol and fruit consumption, cigarette smoking, adherence to therapy hours, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and total cholesterol, triglycerides, and physical activity. In the NRP-e group, however, the prevalence of several behaviors or conditions at risk decreased significantly more than in the control group: obesity (-16%), low fruit consumption (-24%), uncontrolled hypertension (-61%), LDL (-56%), and total cholesterol (-40%).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The NRP-e improved a range of CVD risk factors. The program had low costs, required only an average of <20 min per day in addition to normal practice, and may deserve further evaluation for the inclusion among existing care management approaches.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Hypertensive patients' preferences for complementary and alternative medicine and the influence of these preferences on the adherence to prescribed medication.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to understand hypertensive patients' perceptions of and adherence to prescribed medication.
AB  - METHODS: A qualitative research study based on 23 purposely selected participants from a community health clinic in Malaysia. The participants underwent in-depth semi-structured interviews, and the data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis method.
AB  - RESULTS: The participants were presented with six types of perceptions of medication. The majority of the participants had negative perceptions of Western medicine (WM), self-adjusted their prescribed medication with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and concealed their self-adjusting habits from their doctors. Participants who thought positively of WM took their prescribed medication regularly. Most of the participants perceived the nature of WM as not being curative because of its side effects. Patients have the right to choose their preferred medication when they understand their illness.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Local health care systems should provide patients with alternative health services that suit their requests.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Blood pressure improvement with continuous positive airway pressure is independent of obstructive sleep apnea severity.[Erratum appears in J Clin Sleep Med. 2014;10(6):711 Note: Barandiaran, Felipe Aizpuru [corrected to Aizpuru, Felipe]]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We sought to perform a patient-level meta-analysis using the individual patient data of the trials identified in our previous study-level meta-analysis investigating the effect of positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on blood pressure (BP).
AB  - DESIGN: Patient-level meta-analysis.
AB  - SETTING: N/A.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 968 adult OSA subjects without major comorbidities drawn from eight randomized controlled trials.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic PAP versus non-therapeutic control conditions (sham-PAP, pill placebo or standard care) over at least one week.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean reductions in BP between PAP and non-therapeutic control arms were -2.27 mm Hg (95% CI -4.01 to -0.54) for systolic BP and -1.78 mm Hg (95% CI -2.99 to -0.58) for diastolic BP. The presence of uncontrolled hypertension at baseline was significantly associated with a reduction in systolic BP of 7.1 mm Hg and diastolic BP of 4.3 mm Hg after controlling for OSA severity (apnea-hypopnea index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, PAP level), patient demographics (age, gender, body mass index, use of antihypertensive medication/s), and measures of PAP efficacy (PAP adherence and treatment duration).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: OSA patients with uncontrolled hypertension are likely to gain the largest benefit from PAP in terms of a substantial reduction in BP, even after controlling for disease severity.

TI  - Long-term adherence to nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy by hypertensive patients with preexisting sleep apnea.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although positive screening for and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been recommended for patients with cardiovascular problems, patient adherence to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy primarily for a cardiovascular concern is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the adherence to CPAP therapy by hypertensive patients with OSA after a screening test performed regardless of OSA-related symptoms.
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: CPAP therapy was administered to 194 of the 1365 hypertensive patients who underwent the screening. The monthly dropout from CPAP therapy and the adequate use level (4h every night, 70% days in a month) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier analysis over a 3-year follow-up period.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the patients, 106 (55%) refused or abandoned the therapy by the end of the follow-up period (adherence, 45%). An adequate use level was maintained by 76 patients (39%). Most of the patients' background characteristics, including age, sex, Epworth sleepiness scale scores, and parameters obtained on polysomnography, were not related to adherence or adequate use level. The good-compliance level on the first visit after CPAP therapy introduction was most strongly related to adherence (95% CI, 0.05-0.32; p<0.001) and adequate use level (95% CI, 0.06-0.33; p<0.05). Fourth quartile of apnea hypopnea index value (greater than 67/h) was also related to adherence (95% CI, 0.21-0.98; p<0.02) and adequate use level (95% CI, 0.19-0.88; p<0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The adherence and use level in this population may not be satisfactory but are comparable with those in previous sleep center reports treating symptomatic OSA patients. Thus, the present results would encourage hypertensive patients to undergo positive screening for OSA, regardless of OSA-related symptoms. However, an outcomes study with the same cohort is needed.Copyright © 2013 Japanese College of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - High potassium intake blunts the effect of elevated sodium intake on blood pressure levels.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of dietary potassium on the sodium effect on blood pressure (BP) in the general population and the adherence of current recommendations for sodium and potassium intake. An overnight (12-hour) urine sample was collected in a population-based study to investigate cardiovascular risk. A sub-sample of 1285 subjects (age range, 25-64 years) free from any medication interfering with BP or potassium excretion was studied. Of the participants, 86.0% consumed over 6 g of salt/day and 87.7% less than the recommended intake of potassium (4.7 g). Potassium excretion and the sodium to potassium ratio were significantly related to systolic and diastolic BP only in subjects consuming more than 6 g/day of salt. Subjects in the highest sodium to potassium ratio quartile (surrogate of unhealthy diet) presented 8 mm Hg and 7 mm Hg higher values of systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, when compared with the first quartile, while individuals in the fourth quartile of urinary potassium excretion (healthier diet) showed 6 mm Hg and 4 mm Hg lower systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, compared with the first quartile. Our data indicate that when people have an increased intake of potassium, high intake of sodium is not associated with higher BP. Copyright © 2014 American Society of Hypertension.

TI  - Home blood pressure monitoring, secure electronic messaging and medication intensification for improving hypertension control: a mediation analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the role of home monitoring, communication with pharmacists, medication intensification, medication adherence and lifestyle factors in contributing to the effectiveness of an intervention to improve blood pressure control in patients with uncontrolled essential hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: We performed a mediation analysis of a published randomized trial based on the Chronic Care Model delivered over a secure patient website from June 2005 to December 2007. Study arms analyzed included usual care with a home blood pressure monitor and usual care with home blood pressure monitor and web-based pharmacist care. Mediator measures included secure messaging and telephone encounters; home blood pressure monitoring; medications intensification and adherence and lifestyle factors. Overall fidelity to the Chronic Care Model was assessed with the Patient Assessment of Chronic Care (PACIC) instrument. The primary outcome was percent of participants with blood pressure (BP) <140/90 mm Hg.
AB  - RESULTS: At 12 months follow-up, patients in the web-based pharmacist care group were more likely to have BP <140/90 mm Hg (55%) compared to patients in the group with home blood pressure monitors only (37%) (p = 0.001). Home blood pressure monitoring accounted for 30.3% of the intervention effect, secure electronic messaging accounted for 96%, and medication intensification for 29.3%. Medication adherence and self-report of fruit and vegetable intake and weight change were not different between the two study groups. The PACIC score accounted for 22.0 % of the main intervention effect.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The effect of web-based pharmacist care on improved blood pressure control was explained in part through a combination of home blood pressure monitoring, secure messaging, and antihypertensive medication intensification.

TI  - Adjusted drug treatment is superior to renal sympathetic denervation in patients with true treatment-resistant hypertension.
AB  - We aimed to investigate for the first time the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) versus clinically adjusted drug treatment in true treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH) after excluding patients with confounding poor drug adherence. Patients with apparent TRH (n=65) were referred for RDN, and those with secondary and spurious hypertension (n=26) were excluded. TRH was defined as office systolic BP (SBP) >140 mm Hg, despite maximally tolerated doses of >3 antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic. In addition, ambulatory daytime SBP >135 mm Hg after witnessed intake of antihypertensive drugs was required, after which 20 patients had normalized BP and were excluded. Patients with true TRH were randomized and underwent RDN (n=9) performed with Symplicity Catheter System versus clinically adjusted drug treatment (n=10). The study was stopped early for ethical reasons because RDN had uncertain BP-lowering effect. Office SBP and diastolic BP in the drug-adjusted group changed from 160+/-14/88+/-13 mm Hg (+/-SD) at baseline to 132+/-10/77+/-8 mm Hg at 6 months (P<0.0005 and P=0.02, SBP and diastolic BP, respectively) and in the RDN group from 156+/-13/91+/-15 to 148+/-7/89+/-8 mm Hg (P=0.42 and P=0.48, SBP and diastolic BP, respectively). SBP and diastolic BP were significantly lower in the drug-adjusted group at 6 months (P=0.002 and P=0.004, respectively), and absolute changes in SBP were larger in the drug-adjusted group (P=0.008). Ambulatory BPs changed in parallel to office BPs. Our data suggest that adjusted drug treatment has superior BP lowering effects compared with RDN in patients with true TRH.

TI  - Evaluation of the effect of motivational interviewing counselling on hypertension care.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study tests the effectiveness of motivational interviewing compared with the usual care for Chinese hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was used. One hundred and twenty eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the control group (usual care group) or the intervention group (motivational interviewing group).
AB  - RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrated that the total scores and the mean scores for each dimension of the adherence questionnaire were increased in the intervention group (P<0.05), and the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of the hypertensive patients greatly decreased in the intervention group during the six months of the motivational interviewing counselling (P<0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: The application of motivational interviewing for hypertensive patients is a promising approach for sustaining the clinical benefits of adherence behaviour.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Motivational interviewing should be provided to hypertensive patients at hospitals and community health centres to assist patients in controlling their BP and to enhance treatment adherence. A series of training courses on the motivational interviewing technique should be provided to nurses.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improving adherence to glaucoma medication: a randomised controlled trial of a patient-centred intervention (The Norwich Adherence Glaucoma Study).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving adherence to ocular hypertension (OH)/glaucoma therapy is highly likely to prevent or reduce progression of optic nerve damage. The present study used a behaviour change counselling intervention to determine whether education and support was beneficial and cost-effective in improving adherence with glaucoma therapy.
AB  - METHODS: A randomised controlled trial with a 13-month recruitment and 8-month follow-up period was conducted. Patients with OH/glaucoma attending a glaucoma clinic and starting treatment with travoprost were approached. Participants were randomised into two groups and adherence was measured over 8 months, using an electronic monitoring device (Travalert dosing aid, TDA). The control group received standard clinical care, and the intervention group received a novel glaucoma education and motivational support package using behaviour change counselling. Cost-effectiveness framework analysis was used to estimate any potential cost benefit of improving adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Two hundred and eight patients were recruited (102 intervention, 106 control). No significant difference in mean adherence over the monitoring period was identified with 77.2% (CI, 73.0, 81.4) for the control group and 74.8% (CI, 69.7, 79.9) for the intervention group (p = 0.47). Similarly, there was no significant difference in percentage intraocular pressure reduction; 27.6% (CI, 23.5, 31.7) for the control group and 25.3% (CI, 21.06, 29.54) for the intervention group (p = 0.45). Participants in the intervention group were more satisfied with information about glaucoma medication with a mean score of 14.47/17 (CI, 13.85, 15.0) compared with control group which was 8.51 (CI, 7.72, 9.30). The mean intervention cost per patient was GB10.35 (<US$16) and not cost-effective.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adherence with travoprost was high and not further increased by the intervention. Nevertheless, the study demonstrated that provision of information, tailored to the individual, was inexpensive and able to achieve high patient satisfaction with respect to information about glaucoma medication. Measurement of adherence remains problematic since awareness of study participation may cause a change in participant behaviour.

TI  - Real-world adherence and persistence associated with nebivolol or hydrochlorothiazide as add-on treatment for hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare adherence and persistence associated with nebivolol and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as add-on hypertension treatments.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with >1 hypertension diagnosis (ICD-9-CM 401-405) who used nebivolol or HCTZ as their first add-on antihypertensive therapy between 1/1/2008 and 9/30/2010 were identified from a large claims database. Patients had continuous enrollment for >1 year preceding (baseline period) and following (study period) the first qualifying prescription fill, and did not use nebivolol or HCTZ during the baseline period. A random sample of HCTZ patients meeting selection criteria were selected in a 3:1 ratio to nebivolol patients.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The probability of receiving each drug, adjusted for baseline patient demographics, significantly different comorbidities, and costs was estimated using a logistic model. Inverse propensity score weights were used to balance confounding factors for between-cohort comparisons. Adherence (estimated using the medication possession ratio [MPR]) and persistence (estimated as days from initiation to the first >30 day gap in the index drug supply) at 6, 9, and 12 months were compared using weighted t tests.
AB  - RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of nebivolol (n=722) and HCTZ (n=2166) patients were well balanced after weighting. At 12 months, nebivolol patients had a significantly higher MPR than HCTZ patients (0.76 vs. 0.70, P<0.001), and medication persistence was 28 days longer (273 vs. 245 days, P<0.001). Between-group differences were also significant at 6 and 9 months.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: When used as an add-on therapy for hypertension, nebivolol was associated with significantly higher rates of adherence and persistence compared with HCTZ, after adjusting for baseline differences between treatment groups. These results may be impacted by limitations inherent in insurance claims data, such as the lack of clinical information.

TI  - The evening versus morning polypill utilization study: the TEMPUS rationale and design.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: In clinical practice, blood pressure (BP)-lowering agents are generally prescribed for use in the morning, whereas (short-acting) statins are recommended for use in the evening. There is evidence that the reduction in LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) achieved with short-acting statins is superior when taken in the evening and reported improvement in BP control when aspirin and BP-lowering agents are taken in the evening. However, it is unclear whether the additional reduction in LDL-c and BP is offset by a reduction in adherence, given that taking medication in the evening may be less typical or convenient. There is therefore uncertainty concerning the best timing of administration of a cardiovascular combination pill such as the polypill.
AB  - AIM: The aim of TEMPUS (NCT01506505), a prospective randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) crossover trial, is to evaluate whether there is a difference in LDL-c levels or 24-hour ambulatory BP in individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular disease when the cardiovascular polypill is taken in the evening compared to the morning. An additional aim is to assess the effect of the polypill on LDL-c and BP compared to the administration of separate pills of identically dosed components of the polypill.
AB  - METHODS: In total 75 participants with established cardiovascular disease or an intermediate to high risk for cardiovascular disease are randomly allocated to the sequence of three different treatments of 6-8 weeks: (1) the cardiovascular polypill (aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) in the evening; (2) the polypill in the morning; and (3) the use of the identically dosed agents in separate pills taken at different time points during the day. The primary endpoint is the difference in LDL-c and mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP. Secondary outcomes are the difference in relative risk reduction, biochemistry, platelet function and pulse wave analysis, participants' adherence, and acceptability.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TEMPUS will evaluate the effect of timing of the administration of a cardiovascular polypill on LDL-c and BP measurements in patients with an intermediate or high risk for cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Do the benefits of participation in a hypertension self-management trial persist after patients resume usual care?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension self-management has been shown to improve systolic blood pressure (BP) control, but longer-term economic and clinical impacts are unknown. The purpose of this article is to examine clinical and economic outcomes 18 months after completion of a hypertension self-management trial.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: This study is a follow-up analysis of an 18-month, 4-arm, hypertension self-management trial of 591 veterans with hypertension who were randomized to usual care or 1 of 3 interventions. Clinic-derived systolic blood pressure obtained before, during, and after the trial were estimated using linear mixed models. Inpatient admissions, outpatient expenditures, and total expenditures were estimated using generalized estimating equations. The 3 telephone-based interventions were nurse-administered health behavior promotion, provider-administered medication adjustments based on hypertension treatment guidelines, or a combination of both. Intervention calls were triggered by home BP values transmitted via telemonitoring devices. Clinical and economic outcomes were examined 12 months before, 18 months during, and 18 months after trial completion. Compared with usual care, patients randomized to the combined arm had greater improvement in proportion of BP control during and after the 18-month trial and estimated proportion of BP control improved 18 months after trial completion for patients in the behavioral and medication management arms. Among the patients with inadequate baseline BP control, estimated mean systolic BP was significantly lower in the combined arm as compared with usual care during and after the 18-month trial. Utilization and expenditure trends were similar for patients in all 4 arms.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and medication management can generate systolic BP improvements that are sustained 18 months after trial completion.

TI  - [Beyond the disease: a qualitative survey about (in)formative needs of hypertensive patients]. [Italian]
AB  - Despite the rising prevalence of hypertension, the subsequent increase in incidence of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal events attributable to high blood pressure (BP), and the availability of effective treatment, BP control rates remain low. Although there are many causes of poor BP control, patients' lack of awareness of the consequences of uncontrolled hypertension and patients' lack of adherence to treatment continue to create significant barriers which prevent successful hypertension management. The objective of this study is to evaluate the hypertensive patients' (in)formative needs in order to develop an educational intervention aimed at improving the adherence to hypertension treatment. Questionnaire and focus group are used to collect patients' needs. Results suggest the development of an educational intervention consisting of group sessions where patients can share opinions and feelings together with one-to-one session, based on patients' needs assessment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine patient characteristics associated with achieving and sustaining blood pressure (BP) targets in the Adherence and Intensification of Medications program, a program led by pharmacists trained in motivational interviewing and authorized to make BP medication changes.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with diabetes and persistent hypertension in Kaiser Permanente and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Using two-level logistic regression, baseline survey data from 458 program participants were examined to determine patient characteristics associated with (1) discharge from the program with a target BP (short-term success) and (2) maintenance of the target BP over a nine-month period (long-term success).
AB  - RESULTS: In multivariable analyses, patients who screened positive for depression or had a higher baseline systolic BP were less likely to achieve short-term success (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.42 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.19-0.93], p=0.03; AOR 0.94 [0.91-0.97], p<0.01; respectively). Patients who reported at baseline one or more barriers to medication adherence were less likely to achieve long-term success (AOR 0.50 [0.26-0.94], p=0.03).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Although almost 90% of patients achieved short-term success, only 28% achieved long-term success. Baseline barriers to adherence were associated with lack of long-term success and could be the target of maintenance programs for patients who achieve short-term success.

TI  - Hypertension education and adherence in South Africa: a cost-effectiveness analysis of community health workers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine whether training community health workers (CHWs) about hypertension in order to improve adherence to medications is a cost-effective intervention among community members in South Africa.
AB  - METHODS: We used an established Markov model with age-varying probabilities of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events to assess the benefits and costs of using CHW home visits to increase hypertension adherence for individuals with hypertension and aged 25-74 in South Africa. Subjects considered for CHW intervention were those with a previous diagnosis of hypertension and on medications but who had not achieved control of their blood pressure. We report our results in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in US dollars per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted.
AB  - RESULTS: The annual cost of the CHW intervention is about $8 per patient. This would lead to over a 2% reduction in CVD events over a life-time and decrease DALY burden. Due to reductions in non-fatal CVD events, lifetime costs are only $6.56 per patient. The CHW intervention leads to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $320/DALY averted. At an annual cost of $6.50 or if the blood pressure reduction is 5 mmHg or greater per patient the intervention is cost-saving.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Additional training for CHWs on hypertension management could be a cost-effective strategy for CVD in South Africa and a very good purchase according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The intervention could also lead to reduced visits at the health centres freeing up more time for new patients or reducing the burden of an overworked staff at many facilities.

TI  - A community health worker intervention to improve management of hypertension among Filipino Americans in New York and New Jersey: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the pilot study was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a 4-month community health worker (CHW) intervention to improve hypertension management among Filipino immigrants in New York and New Jersey.
AB  - DESIGN: Single-arm CHW pilot intervention using a pre-post design delivered by 5 CHWs.
AB  - SETTING: New York City, NY and Jersey City, NJ.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Of 88 Filipino individuals recruited for the study, 39 received the full pilot intervention, 18 received a partial intervention, and 31 dropped out; 13 Filipino participants, 10 CHW Trainers, and 3 Filipino CHWs were interviewed for qualitative analysis.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Individuals participated in 4 workshops related to hypertension management and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and received monthly in-person visits, and twice monthly phone calls individually from a CHW.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included blood pressure (BP) reduction and control, appointment keeping, and medication adherence; secondary outcomes included weight, body mass index (BMI), self-efficacy related to diet, exercise, and medication taking, CVD knowledge, and nutrition (salt/ sodium and cholesterol/fat).
AB  - RESULTS: A mixed method analysis was used to assess the intervention, utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods. By the end of the intervention, significant changes were exhibited for systolic and diastolic BP, weight, and BMI (P<.01). Significant changes were not seen for medication adherence and appointment keeping, however, CVD knowledge and self-efficacy related to diet and weight management all improved significantly (P<.01). Qualitative findings provided additional information on the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of the intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This pilot CHW intervention showed evidence of feasibility, as well as efficacy, in improving hypertension management and reducing CVD factors in Filipino Americans.

TI  - Self-reported cardiovascular disease risk factors and associated hopelessness in African American participants of a church-placed health screening program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates patient inertia (PtInert) factors including hopelessness in African Americans participating in church cardiovascular screening programs in low income areas in Forsyth County, North Carolina. Patient inertia is defined as an inability to assume adequate hypertension self-management behaviors, leading to poorly controlled hypertension. Previous findings revealed hopelessness related to blood pressure (BP) control as a key PtInert factor in acute medical environment participants.
AB  - DESIGN: Questionnaires were administered by facilitated interview. Clinical components of the cardiometabolic syndrome were obtained.
AB  - SETTING: The study was conducted within six Forsyth County churches that were participating in cardiovascular screening programs sponsored by the Consortium for Southeastern Hypertension Control.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 67 African Americans (72% female; 49% personal history of hypertension) with an average age of 55 years served as study participants.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants without a history of hypertension were overweight, pre-hypertensive, and normocholesterolemic while those with a history of high BP receiving antihypertensive treatment were normocholesterolemic, obese, and on average had a BP of 143/75 mm Hg. Hopelessness related to BP control was found in 18% of those with a personal history of high BP. A significant relationship was found between hopelessness and family history of high BP, perceived ability to control high BP, and frustration with BP treatment.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that hopelessness, while exhibited less often in church participants as compared to previous findings in the acute medical environment, is associated with participant thoughts, feelings, and histories but is not associated with clinical components of the metabolic syndrome.

TI  - Culturally adapted hypertension education (CAHE) to improve blood pressure control and treatment adherence in patients of African origin with uncontrolled hypertension: cluster-randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a practice-based, culturally appropriate patient education intervention on blood pressure (BP) and treatment adherence among patients of African origin with uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Cluster randomised trial involving four Dutch primary care centres and 146 patients (intervention n=75, control n=71), who met the following inclusion criteria: self-identified Surinamese or Ghanaian; > 20 years; treated for hypertension; SBP > 140 mmHg. All patients received usual hypertension care. The intervention-group was also offered three nurse-led, culturally appropriate hypertension education sessions. BP was assessed with Omron 705-IT and treatment adherence with lifestyle- and medication adherence scales.
AB  - RESULTS: 139 patients (95%) completed the study (intervention n=71, control n=68). Baseline characteristics were largely similar for both groups. At six months, we observed a SBP reduction of > 10 mmHg -primary outcome- in 48% of the intervention group and 43% of the control group. When adjusted for pre-specified covariates age, sex, hypertension duration, education, baseline measurement and clustering effect, the between-group difference was not significant (OR; 0.42; 95% CI: 0.11 to 1.54; P=0.19). At six months, the mean SBP/DBD had dropped by 10/5.7 (SD 14.3/9.2)mmHg in the intervention group and by 6.3/1.7 (SD 13.4/8.6)mmHg in the control group. After adjustment, between-group differences in SBP and DBP reduction were -1.69 mmHg (95% CI: -6.01 to 2.62, P=0.44) and -3.01 mmHg (-5.73 to -0.30, P=0.03) in favour of the intervention group. Mean scores for adherence to lifestyle recommendations increased in the intervention group, but decreased in the control group. Mean medication adherence scores improved slightly in both groups. After adjustment, the between-group difference for adherence to lifestyle recommendations was 0.34 (0.12 to 0.55; P=0.003). For medication adherence it was -0.09 (-0.65 to 0.46; P=0.74).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This intervention led to significant improvements in DBP and adherence to lifestyle recommendations, supporting the need for culturally appropriate hypertension care.

TI  - Psychometric properties of a short self-reported measure of medication adherence among patients with hypertension treated in a busy clinical setting in Korea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) among adults with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 373 adults with hypertension were given face-to-face interviews in 2 cardiology clinics at 2 large teaching hospitals in Seoul, South Korea. Blood pressure was measured twice, and medical records were reviewed. About one-third of the participants (n = 109) were randomly selected for a 2-week test-retest evaluation of reliability via telephone interview.
AB  - RESULTS: Internal consistency reliability was moderate (Cronbach alpha = 0.56), and test-retest reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation = 0.91; P < 0.001), although a ceiling effect was detected. The correlation of MMAS-8 scores with scores for the original 4-item scale indicated that convergent validity was good (r = 0.92; P < 0.01). A low MMAS-8 score was significantly associated with poor blood pressure control (chi(2) = 29.86; P < 0.001; adjusted odds ratio = 5.08; 95% CI, 2.56-10.08). Using a cut-off point of 6, sensitivity and specificity were 64.3% and 72.9%, respectively. Exploratory factor analysis identified 3 dimensions of the scale, with poor fit for the 1-dimensional construct using confirmatory factory analysis.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The MMAS-8 had satisfactory reliability and validity and thus might be suitable for assessment and counseling regarding medication adherence among adults with hypertension in a busy clinical setting in Korea.

TI  - A mixed-method approach to evaluate a pharmacist intervention for veterans with hypertension.
AB  - This paper examines blood pressure (BP) control after 6 months of an intensive pharmacist-managed intervention in a mixed-methods randomized controlled trial conducted at the Iowa City Veteran Affairs Health Care System and two community-based outreach clinics. Patients received the pharmacist intervention for the first 6 months. The study coordinator conducted a summative evaluation with 37 patients 18 to 24 months following the initial 6-month intervention period. BP was significantly reduced in diabetic patients following an intensive pharmacist intervention (-8.0/-4.0 +/- 14.4/9.1 mm Hg systolic/diastolic, P<.001 and P=.001, respectively). BP was reduced even more in nondiabetic patients (-14.0/-5.0 +/- 1.9/10.0 mm Hg, P<.001). Medication adherence significantly improved from baseline to 6 months (P=.017). BPs were significantly lower at 6 months following an intensive pharmacist intervention. Patients also expressed a high level of satisfaction with and preference for co-management of their hypertension, as well as other chronic diseases.Copyright ©2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of nighttime dosing of antihypertensives: review of the literature and design of a pragmatic clinical trial. [Review]
AB  - Blood pressure exhibits circadian variability, and nighttime blood pressure is one of the best predictors of cardiovascular (CV) events. Adults with hypertension who lack a nighttime dipping pattern are at particularly high risk. Several studies have found that bedtime dosing of antihypertensive agents reduces sleep blood pressure and improves the dipping pattern in nondippers. One small study and 2 substudies of diabetes and chronic kidney disease suggest that bedtime dosing of > 1 antihypertensives significantly reduced CV events. A Cochrane review of 5 studies found no difference in adverse events between morning and evening dosing. However, several evaluations in ophthalmology have found that nocturnal arterial hypotension precipitated ocular vascular disorders such as ischemic optic neuropathy. Some authors have suggested that additional studies of nighttime dosing of antihypertensive agents that evaluate CV events need to be conducted. The authors describe a randomized controlled pragmatic trial that is being planned at the University of Iowa and Duke University. Patients with hypertension and other comorbid conditions will be randomized to either continue morning dosing of all antihypertensive agents or to switch their nondiuretic medications to bedtime dosing. Patients will be followed for 36 to 42 months. This study will determine whether nighttime dosing reduces CV risk when compared with traditional morning dosing of antihypertensive agents.Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - In vivo confocal microscopy of conjunctiva in preservative-free timolol 0.1% gel formulation therapy for glaucoma.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects at 1 year of preservative-free timolol gel and preserved timolol eye drops on conjunctiva and tear parameters.
AB  - METHODS: Forty patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to the two treatment groups and compared with 20 healthy age-matched controls. Clinical tests (IOP, Schirmer I test, and lacrimal film break-up time BUT) and in vivo conjunctival confocal microscopy (IVCM) were performed in all patients at baseline and after 12 months. IVCM (HRT II Rostock Cornea Module; Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was performed after topical anaesthesia in the four cardinal locations and at the corresponding limbus to analyse conjunctiva cells. The main IVCM outcomes were goblet cell density and epithelial regularity.
AB  - RESULTS: IVCM and clinical parameters were similar in the three groups at baseline. After 12 months, intra-epithelial goblet cell density was significantly lower in the preserved (48.25 +/- 7.70) than in the preservative-free beta-blocker group (86.83 +/- 22.17, p < 0.001) and controls (88.9 +/- 18.33, p < 0.001). The epithelial layer was significantly more regular in the preserved beta-blocker medication group than in the preservative-free beta-blocker group (p < 0.001) and the control group (p < 0.001). A significant reduction in both Schirmer I and BUT was found in the group of preserved timolol (respectively, 11.3 +/- 2.97 and 8.12 +/- 0.99) compared with preservative-free timolol (16.8 +/- 1.83 and 11.27 +/- 1.27, p < 0.001) and controls (17.8 +/- 1.87 and 12.10 +/- 1.28, p < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Based on our IVCM data, preservative-free beta-blocker gel induces less changes at ocular surface than preserved beta-blockers, a fact that should be considered to obtain less adverse effects and maximal adherence to treatment in a chronic condition such as glaucoma.Copyright © 2013 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

TI  - Who is being reached for a telephone-delivered intervention for patients with uncontrolled hypertension?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telephone-delivered interventions to provide health counseling for complex chronic medical conditions are convenient, acceptable, and cost-effective. However, little is known about which patients are reached, their characteristics, and who benefits most from telephone-delivered counseling.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study examined whether baseline characteristics are predictive of being easily reached for a monthly, telephone-delivered behavioral intervention to improve treatment adherence in Veterans with uncontrolled hypertension. Participants were to complete a telephone session once a month for 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants completed an average of 5.71 out of a possible 6 sessions. Participants who were unmarried, African American, unemployed, or younger or did not complete high school required significantly more call attempts per completed session.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Overall, telephone-delivered counseling is a feasible approach to reaching hypertensive patients. Patients who are married, Hispanic, retired, or older or graduated college may be easier to reach and engage in telephone-delivered counseling. Reaching patients with other sociodemographic characteristics may require more resources or alternate methods.

TI  - Self-management in chronic conditions: partners in health scale instrument validation.
AB  - AIMS: This article describes a study that aimed to validate the Self-care in Chronic Conditions Partners in Health Scale instrument in the Mexican population. The instrument has been validated in Australia for use as a screening tool by primary healthcare professionals to assess the self-care skills and abilities of people with a chronic illness.
AB  - METHODS: Validation was conducted using baseline data for 552 people with diabetes, hypertension and cancer aged 18 or older who were users of healthcare centres in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico.
AB  - RESULTS: Results show high reliability and validity of the instrument and three themes were identified: knowledge, adherence, and dealing with and managing side effects.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The findings suggest the scale is useful as a generic self-rated clinical tool for assessing self-management in a range of chronic conditions, and provides an outcome measure for comparing populations and change in patient self-management knowledge and behaviour. The authors recommend validating the scale in other Latin-American settings with more research into the effect of gender on self- management.

TI  - Guideline adherence in antithrombotic treatment after concomitant ablation surgery in atrial fibrillation patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated real-life oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment after surgical ablation and examined its adherence to current recommendations. We also explored factors related to OAC use preoperatively and at follow-up.
AB  - METHODS: One hundred and fifteen patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) were evaluated during 12-month follow-up after surgery. Patients were divided into two categories according to the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75 years, diabetes and prior stroke [or transient ischaemic attack or thromboembolism] (CHADS2) score: 60 patients were assigned to the high-risk group (CHADS2 score >2) and 55 to the low-risk group (CHADS2 score <1). OAC use was defined as guideline adherent, undertreatment or overtreatment.
AB  - RESULTS: Baseline overall guideline adherence was 62%. OAC was underprescribed in high-risk patients and overprescribed in low-risk patients (both, P < 0.001). The only factor associated with OAC use after logistic regression analysis were age >75 years (P = 0.01) and preoperative AF > paroxysmal (P = 0.013). Overall guideline adherence at 12-month follow-up showed a trend towards a better adherence in the sinus rhythm (SR) subgroup (74% vs 55%, P = 0.02). OAC was underprescribed in high-risk patients and overprescribed in low-risk patients (both P < 0.001). After logistic regression analysis, preoperative OAC use (P = 0.007) and other indications for OAC (P = 0.01) were predictors of anticoagulation treatment.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Real-life OAC prescription in AF patients showed a moderate guideline adherence, with high-risk patients being undertreated and low-risk patients being overtreated. These findings stress the importance that antithrombotic treatment in patients undergoing AF surgery needs to be critically re-evaluated.

TI  - Perceived racial discrimination and adoption of health behaviors in hypertensive Black Americans: the CAATCH trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies examine psychosocial factors influencing the adoption of healthy behaviors among hypertensive patients. The effect of discrimination on health behaviors remains untested.
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the influence of discrimination on adoption of healthy behaviors among low-income Black hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: Black patients (N = 930) in community-based primary care practices enrolled in the CAATCH trial. Mixed effects regressions examined associations between perceived discrimination and change in medication adherence, diet, and physical activity from baseline to 12 months, controlling for intervention, gender, age, income, and education.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients were low-income, high-school-educated, with a mean age of 57 years. Greater discrimination was associated with worse diet and lower medication adherence at baseline. Discrimination was associated with greater improvement in healthy eating behaviors over the course of the 12-month trial.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Prior exposure to discrimination was associated with unhealthy behaviors at baseline, but did not negatively influence the adoption of health behaviors over time.

TI  - Anxiety associated with asthma exacerbations and overuse of medication: the role of cultural competency.[Erratum appears in J Dev Behav Pediatr. 2014 Apr;35(3):227]
AB  - CASE: Toshi, a 14-year-old Japanese boy, had uncontrolled asthma after relocating from Japan with his family 1 year ago. In Japan, he was diagnosed with moderate, persistent asthma, which was controlled with salmeterol and albuterol on an as needed basis. Since moving to the United States, Toshi complained of frequent dyspnea.Initially, he was seen by a Japanese physician who prescribed 200 mg of fluticasone 3 times a day and albuterol nebulization as needed. When Toshi came to the Pediatric Primary Care Clinic, he reported using his nebulizer up to 25 times daily. A physical examination revealed a thin, anxious, jittery, hypertensive, and tachycardic adolescent with hyperreflexia and dysmetria. Toshi complained of difficulty breathing, in the absence of wheezing or respiratory distress; peak flow recordings in the office were normal. Furthermore, he had a history of "panic attacks," being a "worrier," and stopped attending school, playing sports, and socializing over the past 6 months due to his "breathing difficulties."Citalopram was prescribed for anxiety, but the family's apprehension about mental health disorders led to resistance to treatment recommendations. With motivational interviewing and negotiation, Toshi and his family agreed to a trial of citalopram. Three months later, he no longer took fluticasone or albuterol. The tachycardia, hypertension, and neurological symptoms improved. As he gained weight and improved his strength, he attended classes and participated in sports.A few months later, with improvement of his health, Toshi and his parents decided to discontinue citalopram. He then developed behaviors consistent with generalized anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Currently, his symptoms associated with anxiety have worsened, but he and his family are resistant to medication or initiating cognitive behavioral therapy due to their cultural beliefs regarding mental health disorders.

TI  - The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES): rationale for a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist-administered intervention for achieving cardiovascular disease risk reduction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are significant, but often preventable, contributors to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Medication and behavioral nonadherence are significant barriers to successful hypertension, hyperlidemia, and diabetes management. Our objective was to describe the theoretical framework underlying a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist-administered intervention for achieving CVD risk reduction.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults with poorly controlled hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia were enrolled from three outpatient primary care clinics associated with the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Durham, NC). Participants were randomly assigned to receive a pharmacist-administered, tailored, 1-year telephone-based intervention or usual care. The goal of the study was to reduce the risk for CVD through a theory-driven intervention to increase medication adherence and improve health behaviors.
AB  - RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2011 and is ongoing. The target sample size is 500 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) intervention has been designed with a strong theoretical underpinning. The theoretical foundation and intervention are designed to encourage patients with multiple comorbidities and poorly controlled CVD risk factors to engage in home-based monitoring and tailored telephone-based interventions. Evidence suggests that clinical pharmacist-administered telephone-based interventions may be efficiently integrated into primary care for patients with poorly controlled CVD risk factors.

TI  - Efficacy of a text messaging (SMS) based intervention for adults with hypertension: protocol for the StAR (SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial) randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions to support people with hypertension in attending clinics and taking their medication have potential to improve outcomes, but delivery on a wide scale and at low cost is challenging. Some trials evaluating clinical interventions using short message service (SMS) text-messaging systems have shown important outcomes, although evidence is limited. We have developed a novel SMS system integrated with clinical care for use by people with hypertension in a low-resource setting. We aim to test the efficacy of the system in improving blood pressure control and treatment adherence compared to usual care.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial (StAR) is a pragmatic individually randomised three-arm parallel group trial in adults treated for hypertension at a single primary care centre in Cape Town, South Africa. The intervention is a structured programme of clinic appointment, medication pick-up reminders, medication adherence support and hypertension-related education delivered remotely using an automated system with either informational or interactive SMS text-messages. Usual care is supplemented by infrequent non-hypertension related SMS text-messages. Participants are 1:1:1 individually randomised, to usual care or to one of the two active interventions using minimisation to dynamically adjust for gender, age, baseline systolic blood pressure, years with hypertension, and previous clinic attendance. The primary outcome is the change in mean systolic blood pressure at 12-month follow-up from baseline measured with research staff blinded to trial allocation. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with 80% or more of days medication available, proportion of participants achieving a systolic blood pressure less than 140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, hospital admissions, health status, retention in clinical care, satisfaction with treatment and care, and patient related quality of life. Anonymised demographic data are collected on non-participants.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The StAR trial uses a novel, low cost system based on widely available mobile phone technology to deliver the SMS-based intervention, manage communication with patients, and measure clinically relevant outcomes. The results will inform implementation and wider use of mobile phone based interventions for health care delivery in a low-resource setting.

TI  - Design of the Blood Pressure Goals in Dialysis pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is markedly increased among hemodialysis (HD) patients. Optimizing blood pressure (BP) among HD patients may present an important opportunity to reduce the disparity in CVD rates between HD patients and the general population. The optimal target predialysis systolic BP (SBP) among HD patients is unknown. Current international guidelines, calling for a predialysis SBP < 140 mm Hg, are based on the opinion and extrapolation from the general population. Existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were small and did not include prespecified BP targets.
AB  - METHODS: The authors described the design of the Blood Pressure in Dialysis (BID) Study, a pilot, multicenter RCT where HD patients are randomized to either a target-standardized predialysis SBP of 110 to 140 mm Hg or 155 to 165 mm Hg. This is the first study to randomize HD patients to 2 different SBP targets.
AB  - RESULTS: Primary outcomes are feasibility and safety. Feasibility parameters include recruitment and retention rates, adherence with prescribed BP measurements and achievement and maintenance of selected BP targets. Safety parameters include rates of hypotension and other adverse and serious adverse events. The authors obtained preliminary data on changes in left ventricular mass, aortic pulse wave velocity, vascular access thromboses and health-related quality of life across study arms, which may be the secondary outcomes in the full-scale study.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The data acquired in the pilot RCT will determine the feasibility and safety and inform the design of a full-scale trial, powered for hard outcomes, which may require 2000 participants.

TI  - Implementation of the NHLBI integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: rationale and study design for young hearts, strong starts, a cluster-randomized trial targeting body mass index, blood pressure, and tobacco.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the underlying atherosclerosis begin in childhood, and their presence and intensity are related to known cardiovascular disease risk factors. Attention to risk factor control in childhood has the potential to reduce subsequent risk of CVD.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Young Hearts Strong Starts Study was designed to test strategies facilitating adoption of the National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute supported Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents. This study compares guideline-based quality measures for body mass index, blood pressure, and tobacco using two strategies: a multifaceted, practice-directed intervention versus standard dissemination.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Two primary care research networks recruited practices and provided support for the intervention and outcome evaluations. Individual practices were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups using a cluster randomized design based on network affiliation, number of clinicians per practice, urban versus nonurban location, and practice type. The units of observation are individual children because measure adherence is abstracted from individual patient's medical records. The units of randomization are physician practices. This results in a multilevel design in which patients are nested within practices. The intervention practices received toolkits and supported guideline implementation including academic detailing, an ongoing e-learning group. This project is aligned with the American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification requirements including monthly physician self-abstraction, webinars, and other elements of the trial.
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: This trial will provide an opportunity to demonstrate tools and strategies to enhance CV prevention in children by guideline-based interventions.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - TRIple pill vs Usual care Management for Patients with mild-to-moderate Hypertension (TRIUMPH): Study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension management strategies have traditionally focused on "tailored therapy" and "stepped-care" approaches. These tend to be costly and time consuming and often fail to achieve adequate blood pressure (BP) control. The TRIUMPH study aims to investigate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of early use of a 3-in-1 BP-lowering pill ("Triple Pill") compared with usual care for the management of hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: The prospective, open, randomized controlled clinical trial (n = 700) will compare Triple Pill-based strategy to usual care among individuals with persistent mild-to-moderate hypertension (systolic BP >140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP >90 mm Hg, or systolic BP >130 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP >80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) on no or minimal drug therapy. The study will be conducted within approximately 20 hospital-based clinics in India. Participants will be randomized to the Triple Pill (initially strength 1-telmisartan 20 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg, with the option of subsequent titration to strength 2-telmisartan 40 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) or continued usual care. Participants will be followed up for 6 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants achieving target BP at the end follow-up.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This study will determine whether early use of a low-dose triple combination therapy has the potential to address some of the challenges in hypertension control through earlier achievement of BP control, better adherence, and fewer adverse effects, in the context of less intensive clinical follow-up.Copyright © 2014.

TI  - Stress management and dietary counseling in hypertensive patients: a pilot study of additional effect.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Western societies, cardiovascular (CV) disease is the primary cause of mortality, and high blood pressure (BP) is the main reversible factor leading to CV disease. Dietary habits and psychosocial stress contribute to the establishment of hypertension, while its role in the control of high BP is currently examined. In this study, we examined the effect and feasibility of a combined intervention of dietary education and stress management on the control of hypertension.
AB  - METHODOLOGY: A randomized, controlled pilot study was designed to evaluate the effect of combined education on stress management techniques and dietary habits (Mediterranean diet principle) on office BP after eight weeks.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 45 randomized subjects, 36 were included in the final analysis (control group = 20 (age: 67 +/- 12 years, 31.8%, males) and intervention group = 16 (age: 62 +/- 12 years, 47%, males)). CV disease risk factors (except smoking), BP, dietary habits, perceived stress and physical activity (all assessed with validated questionnaires) were similar between the two groups at baseline. After eight weeks, office BP (systolic and diastolic) and perceived stress were significantly reduced, whereas the adherence in Mediterranean diet principle was significantly increased, but only in the intervention group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A combined intervention of stress management techniques and Mediterranean diet education seems to be beneficial for BP reduction. Such interventions could possibly serve as a complementary treatment along with drug therapy or in the early treatment of high normal BP. A call to action for designing epidemiological studies and evaluating the efficacy of such non-pharmacological treatment strategies is therefore warranted.

TI  - Systemic racism moderates effects of provider racial biases on adherence to hypertension treatment for African Americans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to examine perceived exposure to systemic racism as a moderator of the effects of perceived exposure to provider racial biases on treatment adherence and mistrust of health care for a sample of African American hypertensive patients. We hypothesized that patients who endorsed high levels of systemic racism would exhibit poor adherence to hypertension treatment and increased mistrust in health care in relation to perceptions of exposure to provider racial biases.
AB  - METHOD: The sample consisted of 100 African American patients who ranged in age from 24 to 82 years. All were diagnosed with hypertension and were recruited from an outpatient clinic located in the Southeastern region of the United States. Moderated regression analyses were performed to test the study hypotheses.
AB  - RESULTS: Findings revealed a positive, significant main effect for perceived provider racial biases in predicting mistrust of care. This finding suggested that an increase in mistrust of health care was associated with increased perceptions of provider biases. In predicting treatment adherence, a significant interaction revealed that patients who endorsed low and moderate degrees of exposure to systemic racism displayed poor adherence to treatment in relation to greater perceptions of provider racial biases.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The overall findings suggest that patients who perceive themselves as infrequently exposed to systemic racism possess the greatest risk for nonadherence to hypertension treatment in relation to increased perceptions of provider racial biases. Implications of the findings are discussed.Copyright 2014 APA, all rights reserved

TI  - Resistant hypertension optimal treatment trial: a randomized controlled trial.[Erratum appears in Clin Cardiol. 2014 Jun;37(6):388 Note: Multiple investigator names added]
AB  - The prevalence of resistant hypertension (ReHy) is not well established. Furthermore, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are largely used as the first 3-drug combinations for treating ReHy. However, the fourth drug to be added to the triple regimen is still controversial and guided by empirical choices. We sought (1) to determine the prevalence of ReHy in patients with stage II hypertension; (2) to compare the effects of spironolactone vs clonidine, when added to the triple regimen; and (3) to evaluate the role of measuring sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activities in predicting blood pressure response to spironolactone or clonidine. The Resistant Hypertension Optimal Treatment (ReHOT) study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01643434) is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial comprising 26 sites in Brazil. In step 1, 2000 patients will be treated according to hypertension guidelines for 12 weeks, to detect the prevalence of ReHy. Medical therapy adherence will be checked by pill count monitoring. In step 2, patients with confirmed ReHy will be randomized to an open label 3-month treatment with spironolactone (titrating dose, 12.5-50 mg once daily) or clonidine (titrating dose, 0.1-0.3 mg twice daily). The primary endpoint is the effective control of blood pressure after a 12-week randomized period of treatment. The ReHOT study will disseminate results about the prevalence of ReHy in stage II hypertension and the comparison of spironolactone vs clonidine for blood pressure control in patients with ReHy under 3-drug standard regimen.

TI  - Visit-to-visit blood pressure variability and cardiovascular death in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program.
AB  - Most studies of an association of visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure with increased risk of future adverse cardiovascular events are of short duration and rarely include a placebo group. Using data from the double-blind, placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, the authors examined mortality from cardiovascular causes up to 17 years of follow-up using the National Death Index. Visit-to-visit blood pressure variability was associated with cardiovascular death after adjustment for sex, age, serum creatinine, diabetes, body mass index, smoking status, left ventricular failure, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The relationship was significantly stronger in the active treatment group compared with the placebo group. Although this could be the result of an effect of the medications used unrelated to visit-to-visit variability, the data are compatible with the hypothesis that inconsistent adherence leading to missing active medication doses may be an additional explanation for the relationship of visit-to-visit variability with cardiovascular death.

TI  - Challenges in measuring medication adherence: experiences from a controlled trial.
AB  - Measurement of adherence is complex and many methods, both direct and indirect are used; there is no universal gold standard. In this article, we share our experiences in a randomised controlled study, the Hypertension Adherence Program in Pharmacy trial, evaluating a community pharmacy-based intervention for improving adherence to antihypertensive medication. Several objective and subjective measures of adherence (Morisky score, TABS score, MedsIndex, Medicines Possession Ratio) were used, but produced varying results, limiting confidence in the conclusions that could be drawn. Despite using a specifically designed data mining software program to identify potentially nonadherent patients from dispensing records, many participants were found to be adherent by the self reported Morisky scale. A lesson to be learned when targeting people for interventions to improve adherence is that information from dispensing records should be supplemented by other methods in order to identify patients most in need of assistance.

TI  - Association between persistence with statin therapy and reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level: analysis of real-life data from community settings.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To validate the use of drug dispensing data as a measure of drug exposure and to quantify the association between persistence with statin therapy and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels using real-life community data.
AB  - DESIGN: Retrospective, population-based cohort study.
AB  - DATA SOURCE: Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS) database, which contains linked prescription drug information, hospitalization records, and laboratory test results of 2 million members of the second largest health organization in Israel.
AB  - PATIENTS: A total of 87,219 primary prevention patients and 15,139 secondary prevention patients who were MHS members and who started statin therapy between 1998 and 2008.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline and follow-up LDL levels were documented from 3 months before the date of first dispensed statin (index date) to 6 months afterward. Persistence was assessed by proportion of days covered (PDC) with statins during the follow-up period. Over the follow-up period, significant (p<0.001) reductions in LDL levels of 54, 33, and 13 mg/dl were noted among highly persistent (PDC > 80%), moderately persistent (34% < PDC < 79%), and poorly persistent statins users (PDC < 33%), respectively. The reduction was observed as early as 2-3 weeks after therapy initiation. In a multivariable model controlling for baseline LDL level and traditional coronary heart disease risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension), high persistence with statin therapy was associated with a 27% and 25% decrement in LDL level among the primary and secondary prevention cohorts, respectively. Similarly, a higher proportion of the persistent statins users reached their target LDL level within the study follow-up period: 80% and 58% among primary and secondary prevention cohorts, respectively, compared with only 28% and 17%, respectively, among poorly persistent patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this observational population-based study, calculated PDC with statins during study follow-up was strongly associated with drug effect of LDL level reduction. The results agree with previous estimates of statin efficacy from randomized clinical trials, supporting the validity of using PDC methods as a measure of drug exposure.Copyright © 2013 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.

TI  - Non-compliance and inertia in hypertensive Spaniards at high cardiovascular risk: CUMPLE study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess non-compliance (NC) and therapeutic inertia (TI) after 6 months of follow-up in hypertensive patients with poorly controlled blood pressure and high cardiovascular risk.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Longitudinal, multicentre study; 3900 uncontrolled hypertensive patients were recruited from 585 primary healthcare centres. Tablets were counted during visits at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. A tablet count between 80-100% was considered as compliant. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine variables associated with NC and TI.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 3636 patients completed, mean age was 64.8 (SD 10.8) years, 53.7% being male. After one month, 61.8% (60.2-63.4) had uncontrolled blood pressure, 39.5% (37.9-41.1) were NC and 52.3% (50.2-54.4) had TI. At the end of follow-up, uncontrolled blood pressure was 34.6% (33.1-36.1) (p<0.05), NC was 46.8% (45.2-48.4) (p<0.05) and TI was 34.2% (31.6-36.8) (p<0.05). The variable associated with NC was greatest number of antihypertensive treatments (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13, p<0.001), and variables associated with TI were least number of antihypertensive drugs (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84-0.98, p<0.001) and least number of diseases suffered (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.98, p=0.002).
AB  - LIMITATIONS: Due to the complexity of measuring compliance, we have to assume measurement bias.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Among uncontrolled hypertensive patients, after completing 6 months follow-up, approximately one out of two patients were NC and one out of three physicians committed TI.

TI  - A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of varenicline for smokeless tobacco dependence in India.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The rate of smokeless tobacco use in India is 20%; its use causes serious health problems, and no trial has assessed behavioral or pharmacological treatments for this public health concern. This trial evaluated varenicline for treating smokeless tobacco dependence in India.
AB  - METHODS: This was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of varenicline (12 weeks, 1mg, twice per day) with 237 smokeless tobacco users in India. All participants received behavioral counseling. Outcomes included self-reported and biochemically verified abstinence at the end of treatment (EOT), lapse and recovery events, safety, and medication adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Self-reported EOT abstinence was significantly greater for varenicline (43%) versus placebo (31%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-4.2, p = .009). Biochemically confirmed EOT abstinence was greater for varenicline versus placebo (25.2% vs. 19.5%), but this was not statistically different (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.84-3.1, p = .15). Compared with placebo, varenicline did not reduce the risk for a lapse (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.69-1.1, p = .14), but it did increase the likelihood of recovery to abstinence (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.02-1.4, p = .02). Greater adherence increased EOT cessation rates for varenicline (39% vs. 18%, p = .003) but not for placebo (28% vs. 14%, p = .06). There were no significant differences between varenicline and placebo in rate of side effects, serious adverse events, hypertension, or stopping or reducing medication.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Varenicline is safe for treating smokeless tobacco dependence in India, and further examination of this medication for this important public health problem is warranted.

TI  - Hypertension analysis of stress reduction using mindfulness meditation and yoga: results from the HARMONY randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The HARMONY study was a randomized, controlled trial examining the efficacy of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program for blood pressure (BP) lowering among unmedicated stage 1 hypertensive participants.
AB  - METHODS: Participants diagnosed with stage 1 hypertension based on ambulatory BP were randomized to either immediate treatment of MBSR for 8 weeks or wait-list control. Primary outcome analysis evaluated whether change in awake and 24-hour ambulatory BP from baseline to week 12 was significantly different between the 2 groups. A within-group before and after MBSR analysis was also performed.
AB  - RESULTS: The study enrolled 101 adults (38% male) with baseline average 24-hour ambulatory BP of 135+/-7.9/82+/-5.8mm Hg and daytime ambulatory BP of 140+/-7.7/87+/-6.3 mmHg. At week 12, the change from baseline in 24-hour ambulatory BP was 0.4+/-6.7/0.0+/-4.9mm Hg for the immediate intervention and 0.4+/-7.8/-0.4+/-4.6mm Hg for the wait-list control. There were no significant differences between intervention and wait-list control for all ambulatory BP parameters. The secondary within-group analysis found a small reduction in BP after MBSR compared with baseline, a finding limited to female subjects in a sex analysis.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: MBSR did not lower ambulatory BP by a statistically or clinically significant amount in untreated, stage 1 hypertensive patients when compared with a wait-list control group. It leaves untested whether MBSR might be useful for lowering BP by improving adherence in treated hypertensive participants.

TI  - Association of race consciousness with the patient-physician relationship, medication adherence, and blood pressure in urban primary care patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Race consciousness (the frequency with which one thinks about his or her own race) is a measure that may be useful in assessing whether racial discrimination negatively impacts blood pressure (BP). However, the relation between race consciousness and BP has yet to be empirically tested, especially within the context of the patient-physician relationship and medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: Race-stratified generalized estimating equations were used to assess the relationship of race consciousness on BP, measures of the patient-physician relationship, and self-reported medication adherence, controlling for patients being nested within physicians and for patient age and sex.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 61.3 years, 62% were black, and 65% were women. Black patients were more likely to ever think about race than were white patients (49% vs. 21%; P < 0.001). Race-conscious blacks had significantly higher diastolic BP (79.4 vs. 74.5 mm Hg; P = 0.004) and somewhat higher systolic BP (138.8 vs. 134.7 mm Hg; P = 0.13) than blacks who were not race conscious. Race-conscious whites were more likely to perceive respect from their physician (57.1% vs. 25.8%; P = 0.01) but had lower medication adherence (62.4% vs. 82.9%; P = 0.05) than whites who were not race-conscious.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Among blacks, race consciousness was associated with higher diastolic BP. In contrast, among whites, there was no association between race consciousness and BP, but race consciousness was associated with poor ratings of adherence, despite more favorable ratings of the patient-physician relationship. Future work should explore disparities in race consciousness and its impact on health and health-care disparities.Copyright © American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2013. All rights reserved.

TI  - Absorption in self-selected activities is associated with lower ambulatory blood pressure but not for high trait ruminators.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A range of nonpharmacological interventions (e.g., meditation) have positive effects on blood pressure (BP) but tend to have poor adherence. These interventions may lower BP partly by absorbing and directing attention away from one's negative thoughts. We hypothesized that recurring self-selected activities (SSAs) that are attentionally absorbing may similarly lower BP. We examined the effect of reported engagement in SSAs during the previous month prior to participation on ambulatory BP (ABP) and whether those prone to rumination were less likely to show these effects.
AB  - METHODS: Participants (n = 38) reported engagement in SSAs and how absorbing they were, responded to trait rumination and perceived stress questionnaires, wore an ABP monitor for 24 hours, and at each ABP measurement answered electronic diary questions assessing activity levels, affect, social interactions, and caffeine and tobacco use.
AB  - RESULTS: Regression analyses tested whether the reported absorption of SSAs, trait rumination, and their interaction predicted daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic ABP. Greater absorption predicted lower daytime and nighttime ABP (bs = -18.83 to -8.79; Ps < .05), but this relationship was moderated by trait rumination (bs = 3.72 to 9.97; Ps < .05). Follow-up analyses revealed that absorption was unrelated to ABP for those with high trait rumination but that more absorption predicted lower ABP for those less prone to rumination.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that regular engagement in absorbing SSAs is related to lower ABP. These findings have implications for the development of nonpharmacological interventions and suggest SSAs may serve as an adjuvant intervention strategy to lower BP.Copyright © American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2013.

TI  - [Blood pressure control and adherence/attachment in hypertensive users of primary health care]. [Portuguese]
AB  - This is a population-based, descriptive, and analytic study conducted with a randomized and probabilistic sample comprising 340 hypertensive individuals representative of the Family Health Strategy (FHS) Service in Joio Pessoa, PB, Brazil. The present study corresponds to the first part of a cohort started in 2008. The instrument used was an adaptation of the Primary Care Assessment Tool revalidated in Brazil. Logistic regression was used to investigate the associations between blood pressure (BP) control, sociodemographic variables, and an indicator of adherence/ attachment. Among the 340 hypertensive participants, 32.6% were followed up at the FHS, and 89.1% exhibited satisfactory adherence/ attachment. The older adults were more likely to control BP, which suggests a more accurate self-care perception and greater adherence to treatment. The present study highlights the problem posed by the control of hypertension by means of the assessment of services. We expected the present model to be applied at other locations to generate parameters to compare different municipalities.

TI  - Medication utilization and adherence in a health savings account-eligible plan.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a consumerdirected health plan with a health savings account (CDHP-HSA) on utilization of and adherence to medications among individuals with chronic disease.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Pre-post comparison study with matched control group (difference-in-differences analysis).
AB  - METHODS: Data on workers and dependents with 1 or more of 5 chronic conditions--hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and depression--were obtained from an employer that fully replaced its preferred provider organizations (PPOs) with a CDHP-HSA in 2007. A control group of participants from an employer that maintained its PPO throughout the 3-year study period (2006-2008) was created by matching on preperiod (2006) individual characteristics. Difference-in-differences estimates of the impact of the CDHP-HSA were derived by chronic condition for number of prescriptions, proportion of days covered (PDC), and an indicator for a PDC of 0.80 or higher.
AB  - RESULTS: During the first year after implementation, enrollees with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes had significantly less medication utilization (by 1-2 prescriptions) and lower adherence rates (by 0.05-0.09 in PDC; 0.04-0.13 in the proportion adherent). These reductions abated, yet remained, after 2 years among hypertension and dyslipidemia patients. The PDC was significantly lower in patients with depression by 0.07 and 0.05 after 1 and 2 years under the new plan, respectively. No statistically significant impacts were detected on enrollees with asthma/COPD.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A CDHP-HSA full replacement was associated with reduced adherence for 4 of 5 conditions. If this reduced adherence is sustained, it could adversely impact productivity and medical costs.

TI  - The Heart Healthy Lenoir project--an intervention to reduce disparities in hypertension control: study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in blood pressure control are well established; however the impact of low health literacy (LHL) on blood pressure has garnered less attention. Office based interventions that are created with iterative patient, practice and community stakeholder input and are rolled out incrementally, may help address these disparities in hypertension control. This paper describes our study protocol.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Using a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach, we designed and implemented a cohort study that includes both a practice level and patient level intervention to enhance the care and support of patients with hypertension in primary care practices in a rural region of eastern North Carolina. The study is divided into a formative phase and an ongoing 2.5 year implementation phase. Our main care enhancement activities include the integration of a community health coach, using home blood pressure monitoring in clinical decision making, standardizing care delivery processes, and working to improve medication adherence. Main outcomes include overall blood pressure change, the differential change in blood pressure by race (African American vs. White) and health literacy level (low vs. higher health literacy).
AB  - DISCUSSION: Using a community based participatory approach in primary care practice settings has helped to engage patients and practice staff and providers in the research effort and in making practice changes to support hypertension care. Practices have engaged at varying levels, but progress has been made in implementing and iteratively improving upon the interventions to date.

TI  - The CLUES study: a cluster randomized clinical trial for the evaluation of cardiovascular guideline implementation in primary care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The appropriate care for people with cardiovascular risk factors can reduce morbidity and mortality. One strategy for improving the care for these patients involves the implementation of evidence-based guidelines. To date, little research concerning the impact of such implementation strategies in our setting has been published. Aims. To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted tailored intervention in the implementation of three cardiovascular risk-related guidelines (hypertension, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia) in primary care in the Basque Health Service compared with usual implementation.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A two-year cluster randomized clinical trial in primary care in two districts in the Basque Health Service. All primary care units are randomized. Data from all patients with diabetes, hypertension and those susceptible to coronary risk screening will be analyzed.Interventions. The control group will receive standard implementation. The experimental group will receive a multifaceted tailored implementation strategy, including a specific web page and workshops for family physicians and nurses.Endpoints. Primary endpoints: annual request for glycosylated hemoglobin, basic laboratory tests for hypertension, cardiovascular risk screening (women between 45-74 and men between 40-74 years old). Secondary endpoints: other process and clinical guideline indicators.
AB  - ANALYSIS: Data will be extracted from centralized computerized medical records. ANALYSIS will be performed at a primary care unit level weighted by cluster size.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The main contribution of our study is that it seeks to identify an effective strategy for cardiovascular guideline implementation in primary care in our setting.

TI  - Cardiovascular disease risk reduction in rural China: a clustered randomized controlled trial in Zhejiang.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death in China. Despite government efforts, the majority of hypertensive and diabetic patients in China do not receive proper treatment. Reducing CVD events requires long-term care that is proactive, patient-centred, community-based, and sustainable. We have designed a package of interventions for patients at high risk of CVD to be implemented by family doctors based in township hospitals (providers of primary care) in rural Zhejiang, China. This trial aims to determine whether the systematic CVD risk reduction package results in reduced CVD events among patients at risk of CVD compared with usual care, and whether the package is cost-effective and suitable for routine implementation and scale-up.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, open-label, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with blinded data analysis. The trial will randomize 67 township hospitals with 31,708 participants in three counties in Zhejiang Province. Participants will be identified from existing health records and will comprise adults aged 50 to 74 years, with a calculated 10-year CVD risk of 20% or higher, or diabetes. In the intervention arm, participants will receive a package of interventions including: 1) healthy lifestyle counseling (smoking cessation, and salt, oil, and alcohol reduction); 2) prescription of a combination of drugs (antihypertensives, aspirin, and statin); and 3) adherence support for drug compliance and healthy lifestyle change. In the control arm, participants will receive usual care for hypertension and diabetes management at individual clinicians' discretion. The primary outcome is the incidence of severe CVD events over 24 months of follow-up. All CVD events will be defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) monitoring of trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease (MONICA) definitions, diagnosed at the county hospital or higher level, and reported by the Zhejiang surveillance system. Secondary outcomes include: mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, serum total cholesterol (TC), and adherence to appointments, and drugs and lifestyle changes.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This trial focuses on risk reduction of CVD rather than specific diseases. It is not designed to compare therapeutic and healthy lifestyle interventions, but rather their combined effects in primary care settings. Through the trial, we intend to understand the effectiveness of the comprehensive CVD reduction package in routine practice. We also intend to understand the barriers and facilitators to implementing the package, and thus to advise on policy and practice change.

TI  - How many hypertensive patients can be controlled in "real life": an improvement strategy in primary care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that hypertension control is non-satisfactory, but it is not clear how many hypertensive patients can be controlled in real life. We addressed this question implementing a simple, multifaceted improvement strategy in family practice.
AB  - METHODS: Eighteen General Practitioner (GPs) agreed upon a simple improvement strategy including: 1) the use of occasional direct/indirect contacts (prescription refilling) to decrease missing blood pressure (BP) recording, and to increase therapeutic adherence, 2) the use of home BP measurements in non-controlled patients, 3) the addition of a new drug in non-controlled, but adequately adherent patients. Results were assessed after one year by automatic data extraction from the clinical records of all hypertensive subjects.
AB  - RESULTS: The patients with a diagnosis of hypertension increased from 6.309 (age 58.5 +/- 12.4; M 45.5%) to 6.717 (age 58.6 +/- 12.9; M 45.7%): prevalence 25.3% to 27.0%. The BP recording increased: 4,305 patients (68.2%) vs 4,948 patients (78.4%) (+ 10.2%, ci 9.4%-10.9%; p < 0.001), as well as the BP control: 3,203 (50.8% of all the diagnosed hypertensive patients and 74.4% of the subjects with recorded BP value) vs 4,043 (64.1% of all the diagnosed hypertensive patients and 81.7% of the subjects with recorded BP value) (+ 13.3%, ci 12.5%-14.2%; p < 0.001 and + 7.3%, ci 6.7%-8.0%; p < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Almost 82% of hypertensive subjects who contact their doctors can be easily controlled. Most non-controlled patients simply don't see their GPs; in almost all the remaining non-controlled patients GPs fail to increase drug therapy. A further improvement is therefore possible.

TI  - Protocol for the New Medicine Service Study: a randomized controlled trial and economic evaluation with qualitative appraisal comparing the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the New Medicine Service in community pharmacies in England.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication non-adherence is considered an important cause of morbidity and mortality in primary care. This study aims to determine the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and acceptability of a complex intervention delivered by community pharmacists, the New Medicine Service (NMS), compared with current practice in reducing non-adherence to, and problems with, newly prescribed medicines for chronic conditions.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Research subject group: patients aged 14 years and above presenting in a community pharmacy for a newly prescribed medicine for asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); hypertension; type 2 diabetes or anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents in two geographical regions in England.
AB  - DESIGN: parallel group patient-level pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: patients randomized to either: (i) current practice; or (ii) NMS intervention comprising pharmacist-delivered support for a newly prescribed medicine.
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOMES: proportion of adherent patients at six, ten and 26 weeks from the date of presenting their prescriptions at the pharmacy; cost effectiveness of the intervention versus current practice at 10 weeks and 26 weeks; in-depth qualitative understanding of the operationalization of NMS in pharmacies.
AB  - SECONDARY OUTCOMES: impact of NMS on: patients' understanding of their medicines, pharmacovigilance, interprofessional and patient-professional relationships and experiences of service users and stakeholders.Economic analysis: Trial-based economic analysis (cost per extra adherent patient) and long-term modeling of costs and health effects (cost per quality-adjusted-life-year) will be conducted from the perspective of National Health Service (NHS) England, comparing NMS with current practice.Qualitative analysis: a qualitative study of NMS implementation in different community settings, how organizational influences affect NMS delivery, patterns of NMS consultations and experiences of professionals and patients participating in NMS, and patients receiving current practice.
AB  - SAMPLE SIZE: 250 patients in each treatment arm would provide at least 80% power (two-tailed alpha of 0.05) to demonstrate a reduction in patient-reported non-adherence from 20% to 10% in the NMS arm compared with current practice, assuming a 20% drop-out rate.
AB  - DISCUSSION: At the time of submission of this article, 58 community pharmacies have been recruited and the interventions are being delivered. Analysis has not yet been undertaken.

TI  - Characteristics, drug combinations and dosages of primary care patients with uncontrolled ambulatory blood pressure and high medication adherence.
AB  - Most studies on the prevalence and determinants of resistant hypertension (RH) do not account for white coat hypertension, medication non-adherence, or use of suboptimal treatment dosages. We studied the characteristics, drug combinations, and dosages of patients on at least three antihypertensives of different classes who had uncontrolled blood pressure on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and high medication adherence measured by electronic monitoring. The data were collected as part of the baseline measures of a hypertension control trial. Of 140 monitored primary care patients, all with uncontrolled office blood pressure, 69 (49%) were on at least three antihypertensives of different classes. Of these 69, 15 (22%) were controlled on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 20 (29%) were uncontrolled and non-adherent, leaving only 34 (49%) adherent to their medications and having uncontrolled ambulatory hypertension (uncontrolled RH). Thirty-one (91%) of the 34 uncontrolled RH patients were prescribed a diuretic, of which 24 were on hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Less than half of the patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or calcium channel blocker were prescribed maximal doses of these agents. Half of the RH can be attributed to white coat effect and poor medication adherence, and all of the remaining patients were on apparently suboptimal drug combinations and/or dosages. Primary care physicians need to be educated regarding the optimal treatment of RH. Copyright © 2013 American Society of Hypertension. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Adherence to blood pressure-lowering drugs and resistant hypertension: should trial of direct observation therapy be part of preassessment for renal denervation?.
AB  - Renal denervation (RDN) is increasingly used for resistant hypertension. We report here a case of pseudoresistance of hypertension caused by nonadherence to prescribed drug therapy (6 medications), which evaded detection by verification of prescription filling. Direct observation therapy (DOT), in which usual antihypertensive medications are given under supervision, produced substantial reductions in blood pressure, which was subsequently controlled chronically with 3 antihypertensive agents, confirming pseudoresistant hypertension. The novel teaching points are that evaluation of nonadherence to drug therapy is a crucial component in diagnosing resistant hypertension before RDN and that DOT may be extremely useful in avoiding an unnecessary and costly procedure.

TI  - Patient related factors for optimal blood pressure control in patients with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient related factors hindering optimal blood pressure (BP) control in patients with hypertension are unclear.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the barriers to optimal hypertension management.
AB  - METHODS: A survey on the awareness and management of hypertension was conducted in 556 patients (365 males, mean age 60.9 +/- 10.1) from a rural community.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 556 patients who had a clinical diagnosis of hypertension, 127 (22.8%) were unaware the existence of the condition and received no therapy. In the 429 patients who were aware the presence of hypertension, 206 (48.0%) did not receive any antihypertensive medication at the time of this study. Fifty-four (12.5%) had a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg. Only 21 (4.9%) received formal counselling or education from health professionals and 74 (17.2%) were aware of the optimal level of BP. Difficulty in accessing a specialist doctor was reported by 126 (29.4%). In 279 (65.0%), missing regular antihypertensive medications was reported in the 4-week period prior to this study. Omitting prescribed antihypertensive drugs due to the costs was reported by 169 (39.4%).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Inadequate counselling, lack of understanding on the disease, difficulties in accessing specialist care and poor medication adherence are the barriers to optimal BP control.

TI  - Effects of a multifaceted intervention on cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk hypertensive patients: the ESCAPE trial, a pragmatic cluster randomized trial in general practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several observational studies on hypertensive patients have shown a gap between therapeutic targets recommended in guidelines and those achieved in daily practice. The ESCAPE trial aimed to determine whether a multifaceted intervention focused on general practitioners (GPs), could increase significantly the proportion of hypertensive patients at high risk in primary prevention who achieved all their recommended therapeutic targets.
AB  - METHODS: A pragmatic, cluster randomized trial involving 257 GPs randomized by region. The GPs in the intervention group had a one-day training session and were given an electronic blood pressure measurement device and a short recommendation leaflet. Along with usual follow-up, they focused one consultation on hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors every six months for two years. They also received feedback at baseline and at one year on their patients' clinical and biological parameters. Main outcome measures were change in the proportion of patients achieving all their therapeutic targets and each individual therapeutic target at two years, and quality of life.
AB  - RESULTS: 1,832 high-risk hypertensive patients were included. After two years, the proportion of patients achieving all their therapeutic targets increased significantly in both groups, but significantly more in the intervention group: OR (odds-ratio) 1.89, (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 3.27, P = 0.02). Significantly more patients achieved their blood pressure targets in the intervention group than in the usual care group: OR 2.03 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.88, P < 0.0001). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly more in the intervention group than in the usual care group, by 4.8 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.0001 for both). There were no significant difference changes in physical and mental quality of life between groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: An easy-to-perform, multifaceted intervention targeting only GPs increased significantly the proportion of high-risk hypertensive patients in primary prevention achieving their recommended therapeutic targets.

TI  - Impact of a community pharmacists' hypertension-care service on medication adherence. The AFenPA study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the main factors associated with the inadequacy of blood pressure control is patients' non-adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of an intervention program on antihypertensive medication adherence in the community pharmacy setting.
AB  - METHODS: Treated hypertensive patients were enrolled in a 6-month controlled study involving thirteen Spanish community pharmacies. A pharmacist intervention program which consisted of specific education on issues related to medication adherence and hypertension was provided. Additionally, patients were provided with a home blood pressure monitoring device and instructed to measure their blood pressure. The control group received usual pharmacy care. Antihypertensive medication adherence was evaluated by pill counts at baseline and at the end of the study.
AB  - RESULTS: Data from 176 patients were included in and analyzed in the study: 89 in the control group and 87 in the intervention group. The percentage of adherence for intervention group patients increased between baseline and the end of the study (86.0% vs. 96.5%), while it didn't change in the control group (86.5% vs. 85.4%). The proportion of patient adherence at the end of the study was higher in the intervention group compared to the control group (96.5% vs. 85.4%; P = .011). The odds of adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy in the intervention group was 4.07 (95% CI: 1.04-15.95; P = .044) times higher than the control group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of treated hypertensive patients, the pharmacist intervention was associated with significant improvement in antihypertensive medications adherence, compared to usual care.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Morning dosing of once-daily glaucoma medication is more convenient and may lead to greater adherence than evening dosing.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if adherence and convenience of once-daily glaucoma medication is greater in the morning or the evening.
AB  - DESIGN: Prospective, randomized crossover treatment trial.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients newly diagnosed with glaucoma or ocular hypertension requiring intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction were started on travoprost eye drops and randomized to either morning or evening administration for 1 month. They were then crossed over to the opposite dosing schedule for the following month. Adherence was monitored using an automated dosing aid.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence was compared between morning versus evening dosing and first versus second month dosing. Demographic characteristics were obtained, treatment effect was measured, and patients completed a post-study questionnaire regarding the convenience of the 2 dosing regimens.
AB  - RESULTS: Patient adherence overall was good (89.3%). There was no statistically significant difference (P=0.07) in adherence between morning dosing (90.9%) and evening dosing (87.3%). Adherence in the first month (91.7%) was superior to the second month (86.5%). There was no significant difference in IOP response between morning and evening dosing. Patients found morning dosing more convenient than evening dosing.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Early adherence to treatment with a prostaglandin analogue is good, but patients prefer morning administration to evening administration. This may lead to greater adherence with morning administration, particularly among men. Adherence decreases from the first to second month after initiation of treatment. IOP response to this treatment is not significantly affected by morning versus evening administration.

TI  - Shared decision-making in antihypertensive therapy: a cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is one of the key factors causing cardiovascular diseases. A substantial proportion of treated hypertensive patients do not reach recommended target blood pressure values. Shared decision making (SDM) is to enhance the active role of patients. As until now there exists little information on the effects of SDM training in antihypertensive therapy, we tested the effect of an SDM training programme for general practitioners (GPs). Our hypotheses are that this SDM training (1) enhances the participation of patients and (2) leads to an enhanced decrease in blood pressure (BP) values, compared to patients receiving usual care without prior SDM training for GPs.
AB  - METHODS: The study was conducted as a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) with GP practices in Southwest Germany. Each GP practice included patients with treated but uncontrolled hypertension and/or with relevant comorbidity. After baseline assessment (T0) GP practices were randomly allocated into an intervention and a control arm. GPs of the intervention group took part in the SDM training. GPs of the control group treated their patients as usual. The intervention was blinded to the patients. Primary endpoints on patient level were (1) change of patients' perceived participation (SDM-Q-9) and (2) change of systolic BP (24h-mean). Secondary endpoints were changes of (1) diastolic BP (24h-mean), (2) patients' knowledge about hypertension, (3) adherence (MARS-D), and (4) cardiovascular risk score (CVR).
AB  - RESULTS: In total 1357 patients from 36 general practices were screened for blood pressure control by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Thereof 1120 patients remained in the study because of uncontrolled (but treated) hypertension and/or a relevant comorbidity. At T0 the intervention group involved 17 GP practices with 552 patients and the control group 19 GP practices with 568 patients. The effectiveness analysis could not demonstrate a significant or relevant effect of the SDM training on any of the endpoints.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The study hypothesis that the SDM training enhanced patients' perceived participation and lowered their BP could not be confirmed. Further research is needed to examine the impact of patient participation on the treatment of hypertension in primary care.

TI  - Delivering enhanced cardiovascular (hypertension) disease care through private health facilities in Pakistan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world. Over 80% of CVD deaths take place in low-and middle-income countries. One-third of the population aged above 40 years suffers from Hypertension (HTN) and this is largely unreported as there is no registry for CVDs. No guidelines are available for use in health care facilities, especially private health facilities where practice among GPs varies considerably. We aim to conduct a Cluster Randomized Controlled trial delivering a quality HTN-CVD care package at strengthened private health facilities as compared to current practice at private health facilities.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A pragmatic cluster randomized trial, with qualitative and economic studies, will be conducted in Sargodha district of Punjab, Pakistan, from January 2012 to December 2016. At least 912 hypertensives will be registered in the two arms, six clusters per arm. The proposed cluster randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of delivering quality HTN-CVD care, through enabled private health care facilities, to achieve better case registration, adherence and hypertension control also blood glucose and serum cholesterol control. The trial will be conducted through the doctors and paramedics at private health facilities. Main outcomes are mean difference in Systolic blood pressure among the two arms. Secondary outcomes are mean change in total serum cholesterol levels and mean change in glycaemic control achieved in the adult hypertensive patients. Individual and Cluster level analysis will be done according to intention-to-treat.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Due to the high burden of disease where 1 in 3 individuals aged above 45 suffers from hypertension, topped with the fact that there is a dearth of a set of available, standardised guidelines for management, the disease is constantly on a hike in Pakistan. The government has made no effort to issue a set of guidelines adapted specifically for our population and this becomes more of a problem when managing CVD in urban population through private practitioners whose practices vary widely.If our set of context sensitive guidelines show an effectiveness in the proposed intervention districts it will be replicated in other such settings.

TI  - Management of adverse events in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib and clinical outcomes.
AB  - Patients with progressive renal cell carcinoma who undergo sunitinib treatment, experience many adverse events (AEs), including thrombopenia and hypertension. Dose reduction or treatment discontinuation due to AEs makes it difficult to control the clinical condition. Therefore, patients' understanding regarding the basics of blood pressure (BP) measurement and how to deal with each AE are particularly important. Here we report whether or not pharmacist instructions help in order to increase patients' awareness of early AE management results in an improvement of treatment outcomes. The present study included 15 patients who were administered sunitinib. From the start of sunitinib treatment, pharmacists continuously provided drug administration guidance to the patients and confirmed their awareness and knowledge regarding AEs, symptom management, and drug adherence. The relative dose intensity (RDI) of 15 patients from week 1 to 24 after sunitinib treatment was calculated. Pharmaceutical interventions significantly improved patients' understanding of BP measurements and reference values, etc. Although the RDI was 67.3%-78.7%, there were no cases of discontinuation of administration or reduction of the dose caused by e.g. hypertension, hand and foot syndrome (HFS) and stomatitis. Pharmaceutical interventions improved patients' awareness of the management of AEs and adherence to sunitinib therapy. As a result, a high RDI was maintained, which may lead to prolonged survival. Therefore, our results suggest that early AE management provided by pharmacists is particularly important to assure the safety and efficacy of sunitinib therapy.

TI  - Costs of current antihypertensive therapy in Switzerland: an economic evaluation of 3,489 patients in primary care.
AB  - QUESTION UNDER STUDY: Due to greater life expectancy, costs of medication have increased within the last decade. This investigation assesses health care expenditures needed to manage the current state of blood pressure (BP) control in Switzerland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: a) average day therapy costs (DTC) of substances, b) actual DTC of currently prescribed antihypertensive therapy, c) monetary differences of treatment regimens within different BP-groups and different high risk patients, d) estimated compliance-related financial loss/annum and adjusted costs/annum. Single-pill-combinations appear to be useful to increase patient's compliance, to reduce side effects and to bring more patients to their blood pressure goal.
AB  - METHODS: Costs were identified based on data from the Swiss department of health. We calculated DTC for each patient using prices of the largest available tablet box.
AB  - RESULTS: The average antihypertensive therapy in Switzerland currently costs CHF 1.198 +/- 0.732 per day. On average beta blockers were the cheapest substances, followed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs), calcium channel blockers and diuretics. The widest price ranges were observed within the class of ARBs. Most expensive were patients with impaired renal function. Throughout all stages, single-pill-combinations appeared to be significantly cheaper than dual-free-combinations. Stage-II-hypertension yielded the highest costs for dual free combination drug use. The actual costs for all patients observed in this analysis added up to CHF 1,525,962. Based on a compliance model, only treatment amounting to CHF 921,353 is expected to be actually taken.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A disproportionately high healthcare cost is expected due to compliance reasons. The prescription of mono-therapies appears to be a major cost factor, thus, the use of single-pill-combination therapy can be considered as a suitable approach to saving costs throughout all BP- stages.

TI  - EHR-based medication support and nurse-led medication therapy management: rationale and design for a three-arm clinic randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic conditions often use complex medical regimens. A nurse-led strategy to support medication therapy management incorporated into primary care teams may lead to improved use of medications for disease control. Electronic health record (EHR) tools may offer a lower-cost, less intensive approach to improving medication management.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study is a health center-level cluster-randomized trial being conducted within a network of federally qualified community health centers. Health centers have been enrolled in groups of 3 and randomized to (1) usual care, (2) EHR-based medication management tools alone, or (3) EHR tools plus nurse-led medication therapy management. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are prescribed > 3 medications of any kind are recruited from the centers. EHR tools include a printed medication list to prompt review at each visit and automated plain-language medication information within the after-visit summary to encourage proper medication use. In the nurse-led intervention, patients receive one-on-one counseling about their medication regimens to clarify medication discrepancies and identify drug-related concerns, safety issues, and nonadherence. Nurses also provide follow-up telephone calls following new prescriptions and periodically to perform medication review. The primary study outcome is systolic blood pressure after 1 year. Secondary outcomes include measures of understanding of dosing instructions, discrepancies between patient-reported medications and the medical record, adherence, and intervention costs.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study will assess the effects of 2 approaches to support outpatient medication management among patients with uncontrolled hypertension in federally qualified health center settings.

TI  - Evaluation of eye drop administration technique in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate eye drop administration by patients at multiple visits in the setting of a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with topical ocular hypotensive medication in a multicenter, investigator-masked trial. At baseline, patients were given a questionnaire for self-assessment of difficulty with drop administration. At baseline and 12 weeks, patients demonstrated drop instillation using a bottle of artificial tears.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient self-assessment of difficulty with drop administration and observed patient difficulty with drop administration, defined as bottle touching eye/adnexa, drop missing the ocular surface, or administering more than 1 drop.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 164 enrolled patients, 50% had previously been treated with ocular hypotensive medication for >3 years. Only 11.4% of patients reported difficulty with eye drop administration at study entry. At baseline, 18.2% of patients touched their eye/adnexa with the bottle and 10.3% missed the eye. At 12 weeks, 18.5% and 8.6% of patients, respectively, had similar difficulties. Overall, difficulty with drop instillation was observed in 42.1% of patients. Difficulty at both visits was seen in 35.3% of patients who reported difficulty at entry and in 17.2% of patients who denied difficulty. The relative risk of demonstrating difficulty at either visit was 2.0 times greater for patients who self-reported difficulty at study entry (P = 0.004). The relative risk of demonstrating difficulty at week 12 was 3.8 times greater for patients with observed difficulty at baseline (P < 0.001). Limitations of the study design included self-administration of drops to the eye of the patient's choice and observation in an office setting.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with experience instilling topical glaucoma medications continue to have difficulties with eye drop administration, including patients who do not self-report difficulty. The risk of difficulty with eye drop administration is increased in patients who self-report difficulty and in patients who have been previously observed to have difficulty.

TI  - Adherence improvement in Dutch glaucoma patients: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the effect of patient education and the TravAlert() -Eyot() drop guider on intraocular pressure (IOP) and adherence in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT) monitored with the TravAlert() dosing aid.
AB  - METHODS: Multicentre, randomized, controlled clinical trial among 18 Dutch hospitals. Patients were randomized to one of the four study arms: (1) use of the dosing aid, (2) use of the dosing aid with the drop guider, (3) use of the dosing aid together with patient education or (4) use of the dosing aid and drop guider together with patient education. IOP was recorded at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. Data on adherence generated by the dosing aid were collected and studied at the end of the study.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean IOP dropped from 20.3 +/- 5.7 mmHg at baseline to 16.3 +/- 4.0 mmHg (right eye) after 6 months and from 20.2 +/- 5.9 mmHg to 16.4 +/- 4.1 mmHg (left eye). The mean adherence rate was 0.91 +/- 0.1. IOP and adherence rate were not statistically different between the study arms. Patients with 'drug holidays' had a significantly higher mean IOP after 6 months. Patients who used the drop guider were less adherent. A lower adherence level was also associated with new patients with glaucoma and patients with a lower level of knowledge on glaucoma.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patient education is especially useful for new patients with glaucoma. The use of a drop guider does not improve adherence. Especially patients with 'drug holidays' are at risk for developing uncontrolled IOP levels.Copyright © 2012 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

TI  - The impact of health literacy on desire for participation in healthcare, medical visit communication, and patient reported outcomes among patients with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low health literacy (HL) is associated with poor healthcare outcomes; mechanisms for these associations remain unclear.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate how HL influences patients' interest in participating in healthcare, medical visit communication, and patient reported visit outcomes.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study of enrollment data from a randomized controlled trial of interventions to improve patient adherence to hypertension treatments. Participants were 41 primary care physicians and 275 of their patients. Prior to the enrollment visit, physicians received a minimal intervention or communication skills training and patients received a minimal intervention or a pre-visit coaching session. This resulted in four intervention groups (minimal patient/minimal physician; minimal patient/intensive physician; intensive patient/minimal physician; and intensive patient/intensive physician).
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine; patients' desire for involvement in decision making; communication behaviors; patient ratings of participatory decision making (PDM), trust, and satisfaction.
AB  - RESULTS: A lower percentage of patients with low versus adequate literacy had controlled blood pressure. Both groups were similarly interested in participating in medical decision making. Communication behaviors did not differ based on HL except for medical question asking by patients, which was lower among low literacy patients. This was particularly true in the intensive patient /intensive physician group (3.85 vs. 6.42 questions; p = 0.002). Overall, ratings of care didn't differ based on HL; however, in analyses stratified by intervention assignment, patients with low literacy in minimal physician intervention groups reported significantly lower PDM scores than adequate literacy patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low and adequate literacy were similarly interested in participating in medical decision making. However, low literacy patients were less likely to experience PDM in their visits. Low literacy patients in the intensive physician intervention groups asked fewer medical questions. Patients with low literacy may be less able to respond to physicians' use of patient-centered communication approaches than adequate literacy patients.

TI  - Translation and validation of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension for koreans intervention: culturally tailored dietary guidelines for Korean Americans with high blood pressure.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle modification strategies such as adoption of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet are now recognized as an integral part of high blood pressure (HBP) management. Although the high prevalence of HBP among Korean Americans (KAs) is well documented, few dietary interventions have been implemented in this population, in part because of a lack of culturally relevant nutrition education guidelines. Translating and testing the efficacy of culturally relevant dietary recommendations using a well-established dietary guideline such as DASH are imperative for promoting better cardiovascular health for this high-risk cultural group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to systematically translate and validate a culturally modified DASH for Koreans (K-DASH) and obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy.
AB  - METHODS: A 2-step approach of intervention translation and efficacy testing, together with close adherence to principles of community-based participatory research, was used to maximize community input. A 1-group pre-post design with 24-hour urine and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring comparisons was used to test the initial feasibility and efficacy of the K-DASH intervention.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 28 KAs with HBP participated in a 10-week dietary intervention consisting of group education sessions and individual counseling. Both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, as measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, were significantly decreased at postintervention evaluation (systolic blood pressure, -4.5 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure, -2.6 mm Hg; P < .05). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly decreased (-7.3 mg/dL; P < .05). Serum potassium and ascorbic acid levels were also improved in the reference range. Urine potassium level was significantly increased, supporting increased fruit and vegetable consumption.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This pilot study has (a) demonstrated that a cultural adaptation of DASH using community-based participatory research methodology produced a culturally relevant and efficacious dietary intervention for the KAs with HBP and (b) provided strong preliminary evidence for the efficacy of the K-DASH intervention in reducing HBP in hypertensive KAs.

TI  - Effectiveness of the fixed-dose combination of olmesartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension in patients stratified by age, race and diabetes, CKD and chronic CVD. [Review]
AB  - The prevalence of hypertension is high in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as in black and elderly subjects. In addition, these subjects have the lowest control of blood pressure (BP) among the hypertensive population, and also the risk of having a morbid or fatal cardiovascular event >20% in 10 years. For these reasons, aggressive control of BP to <130/80 mm Hg for these subjects is strongly recommended by National and International guidelines. To accomplish this goal, combination therapy with two or more antihypertensive drugs with a complementary mechanism of action is necessary. Drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in combination with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and a diuretic have been shown to be the most effective combinations to accomplish this goal. However, this will require the administration of multiple drugs given separately, which will decrease the patient compliance and adherence to treatment. Poor patient compliance and adherence to treatment is a major factor for poor BP control. Several studies have shown that patient compliance is inversely related to the number of drugs being administered. To overcome this problem, several dual and triple-drug, fixed-dose combinations with a RAS blocker, a CCB and a diuretic have been developed and marketed, which are easier to administer, and have been shown to increase patient compliance and adherence to treatment. In this concise review, the effectiveness and safety of the fixed-dose, triple-combination of the RAS blocker olmesartan medoxomil, the CCB amlodipine besylate and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, as well as other similar combinations for the treatment of hypertension, will be discussed. These drug combinations have been shown to be effective, safe and well tolerated by most patients.

TI  - Extended-release intramuscular naltrexone (VIVITROL): a review of its use in the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence in detoxified patients. [Review]
AB  - Naltrexone is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist that blocks the euphoric effects of heroin and prescription opioids. In order to improve treatment adherence, a once-monthly, intramuscular, extended-release formulation of naltrexone (XR-NTX) [VIVITROL()] has been developed, and approved in the USA and Russia for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, after opioid detoxification. The clinical efficacy of this formulation in patients with opioid dependence was demonstrated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase III trial (ALK21-013; n = 250). In this trial, opioid-detoxified patients receiving XR-NTX 380 mg once every 4 weeks, in combination with psychosocial support, had a significantly higher median proportion of weeks of confirmed opioid abstinence during weeks 5-24, compared with those receiving placebo (primary endpoint). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving XR-NTX achieved total confirmed abstinence during this period than those receiving placebo. XR-NTX was also associated with a significantly greater reduction in opioid craving and a significantly longer treatment retention period than placebo. XR-NTX was generally well tolerated in the phase III trial. The most common (incidence >5 %) treatment-emergent adverse events that also occurred more frequently with XR-NTX than with placebo were hepatic enzyme abnormalities, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, hypertension, influenza and injection-site pain. Thus, XR-NTX is a useful treatment option for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification.

TI  - [Patients' characteristics and clinical management of atrial fibrillation in primary healthcare in Spain: FIATE Study]. [Spanish]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The main therapeutic objective in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients is stroke prevention. This study is aimed to determine whether the anticoagulant therapy may be appropriate regarding to the Guidelines and patients' profile in primary healthcare in Spain.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: A national, multicenter, cross-sectional study of AF patients attended in primary healthcare in Spain has been conducted. The study involved 185 family physicians whose patients were randomized.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 3,759 AF patients were randomized from the clinical records, and 2,070 were included in the study, at an average age of 74 (11) years old (50.7% female). Most of them (78%) had permanent AF and high comorbidity rates (hypertension 75%, obesity 30%, diabetes 27%, heart failure 20%, coronary heart disease 17%, and social risk 15%). Patients diagnosed in primary healthcare were more frequently asymptomatic than in hospital setting (36%; P<.001). The therapeutic strategy was based on the heart rate control in 4 out of 5 patients. Anticoagulation therapy was widely used (84%), more frequently in patients with permanent vs. non-permanent AF (91 vs. 60%, P<.001). Follow-up and monitoring was mainly performed in primary care (72%). The anticoagulation control was suboptimal, with a 66% of the international normalized ratio (INR) in therapeutic range, dropping to 33% when the last 3 available INR were included (P<.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of patients with anticoagulant therapy in primary healthcare has been found in this research. INR control, however, remains suboptimal. Heart rate control is the most commonly used strategy. The decision about the anticoagulation should be based on the thromboembolic risk rather than in the arrhytmia type.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of antihypertensive medication adherence on blood pressure control in hypertension: the COMFORT study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has not been fully elucidated whether antihypertensive medication adherence affects blood pressure (BP) control in hypertension cases.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the association of adherence to antihypertensive drug regimens and BP control using data from the Combination Pill of Losartan Potassium and Hydrochlorothiazide for Improvement of Medication Compliance Trial (COMFORT) study.
AB  - DESIGN: An observational analysis from a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 203 hypertensive subjects were randomly assigned to a daily regimen of a combination pill (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) or two pills, an angiotensin II receptor blocker and a thiazide diuretic. Medication adherence calculated based on pill counts and BPs was evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months after randomization.
AB  - RESULTS: The subjects were divided into three groups according to their adherence, i.e. relatively low-adherence (<90%; n = 19), moderate-adherence (90-99%; n = 71) and high-adherence (100%; n = 113) groups. Clinical characteristics of the subjects including BP, sex, randomized treatments and past medical history did not differ significantly among the three groups. Achieved follow-up BPs over the 6-month treatment period, which were adjusted for age, sex, baseline BP and randomized treatment, were significantly higher in the low-adherence group (135/78 mmHg) compared with the high-adherence (130/74 mmHg; P = 0.02/0.02) and the moderate-adherence (128/74 mmHg; P = 0.003/0.02) groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Low adherence to an antihypertensive-drug regimen was associated with poor BP control.

TI  - Effects of dividing amlodipine daily doses on trough drug concentrations and blood pressure control over a 24-hour period.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the treatment of hypertension, once-daily administration of long-acting antihypertensive drugs has been recommended for the improvement of treatment adherence; however, it is unclear whether dividing daily doses has the additional benefit of more ideal blood pressure (BP) control over a 24-hour period.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate whether dividing a 10-mg daily dose of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, is associated with increased trough plasma amlodipine concentrations, reduced arterial stiffness, and improved BP control over a 24-hour period.
AB  - METHODS: Outpatients with essential hypertension were included this open-label, 2-period crossover study. The patients were administered amlodipine 10 mg/d in 2 divided doses for 8 weeks. At week 4, blood was collected just before amlodipine administration for the evaluation of trough plasma amlodipine concentrations. At week 8, 24-hour, daytime, nighttime, and early morning BP, as well as arterial stiffness, were measured using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), respectively. In the subsequent study period, amlodipine 10 mg/d was administered once daily, and the same tests were performed at the same timings as in period 1.
AB  - RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled (7 men, 3 women; mean age, 61.0 [15.3] years). Mean 24-hour BP with twice-daily administration was not significantly lower than that with once-daily administration (129.7 [7.3]/80.1 [7.9] mm Hg vs 130.5 [11.8]/80.1 [7.9] mm Hg, respectively). Similarly, there were no significant differences in daytime, nighttime, or early morning BP between twice- and once-daily administration. In addition, the differences in trough plasma amlodipine concentrations (22.37 [7.66] ng/mL vs 20.57 [8.22] ng/mL) and CAVI values (8.2 [1.8] vs 8.5 [1.0]) were not significantly different between twice- and once-daily administration.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Administering amlodipine in 2 divided doses was not associated with increased trough plasma amlodipine concentrations, reduced arterial stiffness, or improved BP control over a 24-hour period in patients with essential hypertension.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

TI  - Medication adherence in hypertensive patients of different cardiovascular risk treated in primary health care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The execution of the dosing regimen in Polish primary health care is unknown. The aim of the study was to appraise the medication adherence in patients with hypertension of various cardiovascular risk.
AB  - MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective interviewer questionnaire-based study included 1,467 consecutive patients with arterial hypertension with the pharmacotherapy containing ramipril in the daily dose of 10 mg. The mean observation period was 30.3 +/- 7.0 days (20-56 days). At the followup visit the study participants filled the Morisky-Green test appraising the medication non-adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: As many as 60.9% of the study participants have ever forgotten to take their medicine, 60.7% are sometimes neglectful in regard to their medicine hours, 32.4% skip their medicine hours when they are feeling well and 37.4% skip the drugs when they feel badly due to the medicine. Drug adherence was observed in 26.0% of patients. The level of adherence varied between different cardiovascular risk groups and was higher in the groups of lower cardiovacular risk. A very weak correlation between cardiovascular risk level and non-adherence to medication assessed with Morisky-Green scale was observed (r = 0.078, p = 0.047). No relation of non-compliance to medication to age and gender was noted.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Drug adherence in patients with hypertension treated in Polish primary healthcare is very low regardless of the cardiovascular risk level.

TI  - Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a fixed-dose combination of olmesartan 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5/25 mg in daily practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of olmesartan 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as a fixed-dose combination has been investigated in clinical trials leading to its approval. The aims of the present study were to confirm these data in an unselected patient population in daily practice and to determine the impact of physical activity on blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: In a multicenter, noninterventional study, 3,333 patients with either insufficient blood pressure control on olmesartan 40 mg alone or on a fixed/free combination of olmesartan 40 mg and HCTZ 12.5/25 mg were primarily assessed for safety and tolerability of the fixed-dose combination of olmesartan 40 mg and HCTZ 12.5/25 mg at 24 +/- 2 weeks. Secondary objectives were blood pressure reduction, treatment compliance, and impact of physical activity as measured by the sum of weekly energy costs.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean patient age was 63.2 +/- 11.46 years, mean baseline blood pressure was 159.6 +/- 15.28/93.5 +/- 9.52 mmHg, and 70.9% had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Adverse drug reactions were rare (n = 19), and no serious adverse drug reactions occurred. Compliance with drug therapy was at least sufficient in more than 99% of patients at the end of the study. Blood pressure at the last available visit was reduced by 26.1 +/- 15.5/13.0 +/- 10.1 mmHg versus baseline (P < 0.0001), but had reduced effectiveness in patients >75 years with diabetes or impaired renal function. In 69% of patients, blood pressure was normalized (<140/90 mmHg). No noteworthy differences in baseline characteristics or baseline blood pressure were found between patients with an activity level (sum of weekly energy costs) above or below the median of 9,460.6. A higher versus lower physical activity score had no impact on blood pressure reduction.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our data confirm randomized trial data concerning safe and efficient blood pressure reduction using a fixed-dose combination of olmesartan 40 mg and HCTZ 12.5/25 mg in a large, unselected patient population, independent of physical activity level.

TI  - Hierarchical modeling of patient and physician determinants of blood pressure outcomes in adherent vs nonadherent hypertensive patients: pooled analysis of 6 studies with 14,646 evaluable patients.
AB  - The authors used pooled data from 6 valsartan-related studies including 3983 adherent and 10,663 nonadherent patients to evaluate blood pressure (BP) outcomes in both groups after 90 days of treatment, applying hierarchical linear and logistic regression to identify determinants of BP outcomes. The principal findings were that: (1) BP outcomes were consistently better in adherent patients; (2) approximately a quarter of the variance in 90-day BP values was attributable to a physician class effect; (3) common and unique patient- and physician-related variables were associated with BP outcomes in both groups; (4) physician vigilance was associated with better outcomes, especially in adherent patients; and (5) adherent patients were more likely to exhibit target organ damage and associated events while being prescribed more complex medication regimens. Adherence to antihypertensive medication may be a function of prior line treatment failure, severity of illness, and sequelae, and the ensuing patient resolution to change medication behavior.

TI  - Preliminary validation of the Hypertension Self-Care Activity Level Effects (H-SCALE) and clinical blood pressure among patients with hypertension.
AB  - This study establishes preliminary validation of a measure that assesses hypertension self-care activities with clinical blood pressure (BP). The Hypertension Self-Care Activity Level Effects (H-SCALE) was administered to patients with hypertension to assess levels of self-care. Patients (n=154) were predominantly female (68.6%) and black (79.2%). Greater adherence to self-care was associated with lower systolic and diastolic BP for 5 of the 6 self-care behaviors. Medication adherence was correlated with systolic BP (r=-0.19, P<.05) and weight management adherence was correlated with diastolic BP (r=-0.22, P<.05) after controlling for other covariates. Increased adherence to recommended dietary practices was strongly correlated with higher systolic (r=0.29, P<.05) and diastolic BP (r=0.32, P<.05). The H-SCALE was acceptable for use in clinical settings, and adherence to self-care was generally aligned with lower BP. Assessment of hypertension self-care is important when working with individuals to control their BP. Copyright ©2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Improving refill adherence and hypertension control in black patients: Wisconsin TEAM trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and sustainability of a 6-month Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) intervention for black patients with hypertension in community chain pharmacies.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial.
AB  - SETTING: 28 chain pharmacies (14 TEAM and 14 control) in five Wisconsin cities from December 2006 to February 2009.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 576 black patients with hypertension.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Trained pharmacist-technician teams implemented a 6-month intervention using scheduled visits, Brief Medication Questionnaires (BMQs), and novel toolkits for facilitating medication adherence and pharmacist feedback to patients and physicians. Control participants received patient information only.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refill adherence (>80% days covered) and changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and blood pressure control using blinded assessments at 6 and 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: At baseline, all patients had blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more. Of those eligible, 79% activated the intervention (mean 4.25 visits). Compared with control participants at 6 months, TEAM participants achieved greater improvements in refill adherence (60% vs. 34%, P < 0.001), SBP (-12.62 vs. -5.31 mm Hg, P < 0.001), and blood pressure control (50% vs. 36%, P = 0.01). Six months after intervention discontinuation, TEAM participants showed sustained improvements in refill adherence ( P < 0.001) and SBP ( P = 0.004), though the difference in blood pressure control was not significant ( P < 0.05) compared with control participants. Analysis of intervention fidelity showed that patients who received the full intervention during months 1 through 6 achieved significantly greater 6- and 12-month improvements in refill adherence and blood pressure control compared with control participants.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A team-based intervention involving community chain pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and novel toolkits led to significant and sustained improvements in refill adherence and SBP in black patients with hypertension.

TI  - Effects of individual physician-level and practice-level financial incentives on hypertension care: a randomized trial.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Pay for performance is intended to align incentives to promote high-quality care, but results have been contradictory.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of explicit financial incentives to reward guideline-recommended hypertension care.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized trial of 12 Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics with 5 performance periods and a 12-month washout that enrolled 83 primary care physicians and 42 nonphysician personnel (eg, nurses, pharmacists).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Physician-level (individual) incentives, practice-level incentives, both, or none. Intervention participants received up to 5 payments every 4 months; all participants could access feedback reports.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Among a random sample, number of patients achieving guideline-recommended blood pressure thresholds or receiving an appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure, number of patients prescribed guideline-recommended medications, and number who developed hypotension.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean (SD) total payments over the study were $4270 ($459), $2672 ($153), and $1648 ($248) for the combined, individual, and practice-level interventions, respectively. The unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change over the study in patients meeting the combined blood pressure/appropriate response measure were 75% to 84% and 8.84% (95% CI, 4.20% to 11.80%) for the individual group, 80% to 85% and 3.70% (95% CI, 0.24% to 7.68%) for the practice-level group, 79% to 88% and 5.54% (95% CI, 1.92% to 9.52%) for the combined group, and 86% to 86% and 0.47% (95% CI, -3.12% to 4.04%) for the control group. The adjusted absolute estimated difference in the change between the proportion of patients with blood pressure control/appropriate response for individual incentive and control groups was 8.36% (95% CI, 2.40% to 13.00%; P=.005). The other incentive groups did not show a significant change compared with controls for this outcome. For medications, the unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change were 61% to 73% and 9.07% (95% CI, 4.52% to 13.44%), 56% to 65% and 4.98% (95% CI, 0.64% to 10.08%), 65% to 80% and 7.26% (95% CI, 2.92% to 12.48%), and 63% to 72% and 4.35% (95% CI, -0.28% to 9.28%), respectively. These changes in the use of guideline-recommended medications were not significant in any of the incentive groups compared with controls, nor was the incidence of hypotension. The effect of the incentive was not sustained after a washout.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Individual financial incentives, but not practice-level or combined incentives, resulted in greater blood pressure control or appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure; none of the incentives resulted in greater use of guideline-recommended medications or increased incidence of hypotension compared with controls. Further research is needed on the factors that contributed to these findings.

TI  - Tailored Case Management for Diabetes and Hypertension (TEACH-DM) in a community population: study design and baseline sample characteristics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recognition of the benefits associated with well-controlled diabetes and hypertension, control remains suboptimal. Effective interventions for these conditions have been studied within academic settings, but interventions targeting both conditions have rarely been tested in community settings. We describe the design and baseline results of a trial evaluating a behavioral intervention among community patients with poorly-controlled diabetes and comorbid hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Tailored Case Management for Diabetes and Hypertension (TEACH-DM) is a 24-month randomized, controlled trial evaluating a telephone-delivered behavioral intervention for diabetes and hypertension versus attention control. The study recruited from nine community practices. The nurse-administered intervention targets 3 areas: 1) cultivation of healthful behaviors for diabetes and hypertension control; 2) provision of fundamentals to support attainment of healthful behaviors; and 3) identification and correction of patient-specific barriers to adopting healthful behaviors. Hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure measured at 6, 12, and 24 months are co-primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, self-reported medication adherence, exercise, and cost-effectiveness.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 377 randomized patients, 193 were allocated to the intervention and 184 to attention control. The cohort is balanced in terms of gender, race, education level, and income. The cohort's mean baseline hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure are above goal, and mean baseline body mass index falls in the obese range. Baseline self-reported non-adherence is high for diabetes and hypertension medications. Trial results are pending.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: If effective, the TEACH-DM intervention's telephone-based delivery strategy and nurse administration make it well-suited for rapid implementation and broad dissemination in community settings.Copyright © 2013.

TI  - Mobile health (mHealth) based medication adherence measurement - a pilot trial using electronic blisters in diabetes patients.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to evaluate a mobile health (mHealth) based remote medication adherence measurement system (mAMS) in elderly patients with increased cardiovascular risk treated for diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension. Cardiovascular risk was defined as the presence of at least two out of the three risk factors: type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: For treatment of diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension, four predefined routinely used drugs were selected. Drug adherence was investigated in a controlled randomized doctor blinded study with crossover design. The mAMS was used to measure and improve objectively the adherence by means of closed-loop interactions.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean age of the 53 patients (30 female) was 69.4 +/- 4.8 years. A total of 1654 electronic blisters were handed out. A statistically significant difference (P = 0.04) between the monitoring and the control phase was observed for the diabetes medication only. In a post-study questionnaire twenty-nine patients appreciated that their physician knew if and when they had taken their medications and 13 asked for more or automated communication with their physicians. Only one subject withdrew from the study because of technical complexity.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that mHealth based adherence management is feasible and well accepted by patients with increased cardiovascular risk. It may help to increase adherence, even in patients with high baseline adherence and, subsequently, lead to improved control of indicators including blood pressure and cholesterol concentrations.

TI  - Effects of a web-based patient activation intervention to overcome clinical inertia on blood pressure control: cluster randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Only approximately half of patients with hypertension have their blood pressure controlled, due in large part to the tendency of primary care providers (PCPs) not to intensify treatment when blood pressure values are elevated.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study tested the effect of an intervention designed to help patients ask questions at the point of care to encourage PCPs to appropriately intensify blood pressure treatment.
AB  - METHODS: PCPs and their patients with hypertension (N=500) were recruited by letter and randomized into 2 study groups: (1) intervention condition in which patients used a fully automated website each month to receive tailored messages suggesting questions to ask their PCP to improve blood pressure control, and (2) control condition in which a similar tool suggested questions to ask about preventive services (eg, cancer screening). The Web-based tool was designed to be used during each of the 12 study months and before scheduled visits with PCPs. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients in both conditions with controlled blood pressure.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 500 enrolled patients (intervention condition: n=282; control condition: n=218), 418 (83.6%) completed the 12-month follow-up visit. At baseline, 289 (61.5%) of participants had controlled blood pressure. Most (411/500, 82.2%) participants used the intervention during at least 6 of 12 months and 222 (62.5%) reported asking questions directly from the Web-based tool. There were no group differences in asking about medication intensification and there were no differences in blood pressure control after 12 months between the intervention condition (201/282, 71.3%) and control condition (143/218, 65.6%; P=.27) groups. More intervention condition participants discussed having a creatinine test (92, 52.6% vs 49, 35.5%; P=.02) and urine protein test (81, 44.8% vs 21, 14.6%; P<.001), but no group differences were observed in the rate of testing. The control condition participants reported more frequent discussions about tetanus and pneumonia vaccines and reported more tetanus (30, 13.8% vs 15, 5.3%; P=.02) and pneumonia (25, 11.5% vs 16, 5.7%; P=.02) vaccinations after 12 months.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The use of an interactive website designed to overcome clinical inertia for hypertension care did not lead to improvements in blood pressure control. Participant adherence to the intervention was high. The control intervention led to positive changes in the use of preventive services (eg, tetanus immunization) and the intervention condition led to more discussions of hypertension-relevant tests (eg, serum creatinine and urine protein). By providing patients with individually tailored questions to ask during PCP visits, this study demonstrated that participants were likely to discuss the questions with PCPs. These discussions did not, however, lead to improvements in blood pressure control.

TI  - Amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg versus valsartan 160 mg in Chinese hypertensives.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A majority of hypertensives require treatment with >2 antihypertensive therapies to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals. Single-pill combinations (SPC) may improve convenience and adherence to therapy and reduce health care resource use and costs. The antihypertensive effects of amlodipine and valsartan are well established. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg SPC for the treatment of hypertension in predominantly Chinese patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg alone.
AB  - METHODS: In this multicentre study (24 centres), adults with stage 1 or 2 hypertension not adequately controlled with valsartan monotherapy were randomised to receive double-blind amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg SPC or valsartan 160 mg once daily for 8 weeks.
AB  - RESULTS: The least-square mean change (standard error) from baseline to endpoint in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP) at trough, the primary efficacy variable, was -10.3 (0.39) mm Hg with amlodipine/valsartan and -6.6 (0.40) mm Hg with valsartan (difference: -3.7 [0.54] mm Hg, p<0.0001). The corresponding results for mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) were -14.9 (0.61) mm Hg and -7.0 (0.61) mm Hg, respectively (difference: -7.9 [0.84] mm Hg, p<0.0001). A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved overall BP control (MSSBP/MSDBP<140/90 mm Hg) with combination therapy (61.3%) versus monotherapy (39.3%; p<0.0001). Both treatments were well tolerated.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg SPC is a safe and effective therapy for lowering BP in predominantly Chinese adults with stage 1 or 2 hypertension not adequately controlled with valsartan 160 mg monotherapy.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Influence of living arrangements on the management and control of hypertension: a mixed-methods study of Korean American elderly.
AB  - Elders living alone may experience worse health outcomes than do those living with spouse and/or children. Using baseline data from a randomized trial to promote high blood pressure (HBP) control in Korean elders (N = 440), we examined the relationship between living arrangements and HBP control. We also interviewed a sub-sample to better understand the patterns of social interactions associated with different types of living arrangements. One in five reported living alone; this group tended to be older and female, and resided in senior group housing. Those living alone were twice as likely as those living with a spouse to have controlled BP (OR = 2.08; 95 % CI 1.09-3.97), even after controlling for study covariates. Those in senior group housing had frequent social interactions that involved conversations around health, encouragement concerning medication taking, and health information sharing. In conclusion, Korean elders living independently are neither socially-isolated nor at increased risk for poor BP control.

TI  - Impact of once-daily versus twice-daily dosing frequency on adherence to chronic medications among patients with venous thromboembolism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple daily dosing may be negatively associated with patient medication adherence; however, adherence-related data are lacking in a patient population with venous thromboembolism (VTE).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the adherence rates between once-daily (OD) and twice-daily (BID) dosing regimens of chronic medications in patients with VTE.
AB  - METHODS: We analyzed the PharMetrics Integrated Claims database (claims of commercial insurers in the US) from 1 January 2004, through 31 December 2009. Adult patients with continuous insurance coverage, newly initiated on diabetes mellitus or hypertension medication, and having at least one VTE diagnosis were included. Adherence to OD and BID therapies was calculated by using two measures: medication possession ratio (MPR) and proportion of days covered (PDC). Adherence was defined as an MPR or PDC >0.8. Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to compare the probability of adherence between the OD and BID groups adjusting for baseline confounders.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 4,867 OD and 1,069 BID patients were identified. Mean duration of exposure to therapy for OD and BID patients was 386 and 356 days (p = 0.011), respectively. Based on MPR, 69 % of OD and 62 % of BID patients were adherent (p < 0.001). For PDC at 12 months, the proportion of adherent patients for the OD and BID groups was 45 and 36 % (p < 0.001), respectively. Adjusted odds ratios (95 % CI) of adherence for the OD relative to BID group were 1.61 (1.37-1.89) based on MPR (p < 0.001) and 1.46 (1.16-1.83) based on PDC at 12 months (p = 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that VTE patients treated with chronic medications on OD dosing regimens were associated with an approximately 39-61 % higher likelihood of adherence compared with subjects on BID dosing regimens.

TI  - Utility of a post-hospitalization stroke prevention program managed by nurses.
AB  - GOAL: Evidence-based guidelines exist for the prevention and treatment of patients with cerebral ischemia. Despite these guidelines, there are gaps in clinical practice. Our study aimed to determine if a physician-directed, nurse-case-management program could reduce individual patient vascular risk factors.
AB  - METHODS: Patients hospitalized with atherosclerotic cerebral ischemia with > 1 major uncontrolled risk factor for stroke (hypertension, tobacco use, dyslipidemia, diabetes) were eligible to enroll in our study. Patients were randomized to management by the nurse-prevention program or usual care. Patients in the usual-care group received their initial risk-factor assessment and a scheduled follow-up at 1 year. Patients in the usual-care group underwent further follow-up by primary care and/or neurology as recommended during their hospitalization or outpatient visit. Patients assigned to the prevention group received individualized education, motivational interviewing, and were aided in setting up their risk-factor modification goal plan. Additional education was tailored to each patient based on individualized risk factors. Prevention-group patients also underwent consultation with a registered dietitian and an exercise physiologist. The primary endpoint of the study was improvement of > 1 major patient risk factor for occurrence of stroke to goal at 1 year.
AB  - RESULTS: At 1-year post-hospitalization, patients in the nurse-care-management group were 42% more likely to have met the primary endpoint (n = 18; 61% nurse-managed patients) compared with 33% (n = 18) of patients undergoing usual care (P = 0.09). There was no significant reduction in minor risk factors for either patient group. Patients in the prevention group had greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (-38 vs -4; P = 0.0083), changes in cardiovascular risk score (-5.2 vs 1.3; P = 0.0033), and had a greater reductions in systolic blood pressure (-12.2 vs -0.105; P = 0.07) than their usual-care counterparts (changes shown respectively). Patients in the prevention group were more likely to follow a prescribed diet than those in the usual-care group (50% vs 7%, respectively; P = 0.0070) and maintain an exercise program (83% vs 33%, respectively; P = 0.0018).
AB  - SUMMARY: A physician-directed, nurse case-management system for patients post-hospitalization for cerebral ischemia is feasible and may help improve long-term control of major patient risk factors for stroke. A larger trial is needed to verify trends noted in our study.

TI  - Renal sympathetic denervation in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension after witnessed intake of medication before qualifying ambulatory blood pressure.
AB  - It is unknown whether the decline in blood pressure (BP) after renal denervation (RDN) is caused by denervation itself or concomitantly improved drug adherence. We aimed to investigate the BP lowering effect of RDN in true treatment-resistant hypertension by excluding patients with poor drug adherence. Patients with resistant hypertension (n=18) were referred for a thorough clinical and laboratory work-up. Treatment-resistant hypertension was defined as office systolic BP>140 mm Hg, despite maximally tolerated doses of > 3 antihypertensive drugs, including a diuretic. In addition, ambulatory daytime systolic BP>135 mm Hg was required after witnessed intake of antihypertensive drugs to qualify. RDN (n=6) was performed with Symplicity Catheter System. The mean office and ambulatory BPs remained unchanged at 1, 3, and 6 months in the 6 patients, whereas there was no known change in antihypertensive medication. Two patients, however, had a fall in both office and ambulatory BPs. Our findings question whether BP falls in response to RDN in patients with true treatment-resistant hypertension. Additional research must aim to verify potential BP lowering effect and identify a priori responders to RDN before this invasive method can routinely be applied to patients with drug-resistant hypertension.

TI  - Effectiveness of a group education session on adherence with APAP in obstructive sleep apnea--a randomized controlled study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (APAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). We investigated whether a single group education session on APAP therapy is effective in promoting adherence among patients with OSAHS.
AB  - METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel group study included patients newly diagnosed with OSAHS who met criteria for APAP therapy. Patients were randomized into a study group and a control group. All patients in the study group were assigned to a single group education session, 1 month after beginning APAP therapy.
AB  - RESULTS: We evaluated 146 patients. The median percentage of APAP usage days was 88.3 %, with a median duration per day of use of 6.02 h; 59 % were classified as adherent. Overall, no significant difference in adherence was seen between the study and the control groups. Analyzing patient subgroups, the group session significantly improved APAP adherence among males and patients who were younger (<65 years old), obese (BMI > 35 kg/m(2)), non-sleepy (Epworth sleepiness scale < 11), smokers or past smokers, had hypertension or nocturia and those with non-severe OSAHS.
AB  - CONCLUSION: To maximize the impact of group education sessions and, by that, saving resources, it may be important to select patients likely to benefit from these sessions.

TI  - Effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy among a sample of patients in Colombia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy in a sample of patients affiliated with the Sistema General de Seguridad Social en Salud (the Colombian health system).
AB  - METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 January 2010-30 June 2011. From a total of 8 316 patients in 10 cities, a random sample of 600 was stratified according to dyslipidemia. Information on sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics, risk factors, and pharmacological and laboratory variables were obtained from medical records.
AB  - RESULTS: Subjects were predominantly female (56.2%), with a mean age of 65.1 +/- 11.5 years; 93.2% had hypertension; 29.0%, diabetes mellitus; and 10.2%, a history of myocardial infarction. The patients were being treated with lovastatin (84.1%) or gemfibrozil (12.3%)-both at doses below what is recommended-or atorvastatin (1.8%). In patients with high cardiovascular risk, 38.6% achieved goals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (<100 mg/dL). Among those at moderate risk, 49.4% reached the target level (< 130 mg/dL). On average, there was a 4.9% reduction in LDL-C. Sex, age, history of cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes mellitus, use of hydrochlorothiazide, and poor therapy adherence were statistically associated with a lack of dyslipidemia control.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Because a lack LDL-C control occurred in patients with two or more of the following variables: male, more than 55 years of age, diabetes and/or a history of cardiovascular disease, received lower doses of lovastatin, or non-adherent to treatment, it is recommended that medication be increased based on clearly-defined therapeutic goals and that comorbidities be assessed and effectively treated.

TI  - Cardiovascular prevention in coronary heart disease patients: guidelines implementation in clinical practice.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the utilization of a clinical improvement program in stable coronary artery disease patients to increase the evidence-proven treatment utilization, and to describe the ongoing clinical practice and lifestyle change counseling.
AB  - METHODS: Cross-sectional study followed by a longitudinal component in which the tools utilization to improve clinical practice was assessed by means of additional cross-sectional data collection. 710 consecutive patients were included (Phase 1). After tools implementation, within 6 months period, 705 patients were included (Phase 2) for comparative analysis. Randomly, 318 patients from Phase 1 were selected, 6-12 months after the first evaluation (Phase 3).
AB  - RESULTS: Phase 1 to Phase 2: there were improvement on smoking cessation (P=0.019), dyslipidemia (P<0.001), hypertension and physical activity (P<0.001). There was significant difference on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors - ACEI (67.2% vs. 56.8%, P<0.001); angiotensin II receptor blockers - ARB II (25.4% vs. 32.9%, P=0.002) and beta-blocker (88.7% vs. 91.9%, P=0.047). Phase 1 to Phase 3: there was both weight (P=0.044), and blood pressure reduction (P<0.001). There was statistical significant difference on ACEI (64.8% vs. 61.6%, P=0.011) and ARB II (27.0% vs. 31.3%, P=0.035).
AB  - CONCLUSION: There was no significant change on the evidence-based pharmacological treatment utilization between pre and post-intervention phases; there was significant improvement concerning smoking and physical activity in phase 2; substantial improvement on blood pressure levels in both comparisons (Phase 1 to 2 and Phase 1 to 3). The inclusion of a case-manager for the process management was crucial for program efficacy. Comprehensive programs for clinical practice should be pursued for longer follow-up period.

TI  - The role of salt intake and salt sensitivity in the management of hypertension in South Asian people with chronic kidney disease: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of salt restriction to lower blood pressure (BP) in Bangladeshi patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a tailored intervention intended to reduce salt intake in addition to standard care will achieve a greater reduction in BP in UK Bangladeshi patients with CKD than standard care alone.
AB  - DESIGN: A randomised parallel-group controlled trial conducted over a 6 month period.
AB  - SETTING: A tertiary renal unit based in acute care hospital in East London.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 56 adult participants of Bangladeshi origin with CKD and BP >130/80 mm Hg or on antihypertensive medication.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly allocated to receive a tailored low-salt diet or the standard low-salt advice. BP medication, physical activity and weight were monitored.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in ambulatory BP. Adherence to dietary advice was assessed by measurement of 24 h urinary salt excretion.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 56 participants randomised, six withdrew at the start of the study. During the study, one intervention group participant died, one control group participant moved to Bangladesh. Data were available for the primary endpoint on 48 participants. Compared with control group the intervention urinary sodium excretion fell from 260 mmol/d to 103 mmol/d (-131 to -76, p<0.001) at 6 months and resulted in mean (95% CI) falls in 24 h systolic/diastolic BP of -8 mm Hg (-11 to -5)/2 (-4 to -2) both p<0.001.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A tailored intervention can achieve moderate salt restriction in patients with CKD, resulting in clinically meaningful falls in BP independent of hypertensive medication.

TI  - Results of the CAPPS: COPD--assessment of practice in primary care study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since many patients with COPD in the US are managed by primary care physicians, we evaluated adherence to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines in a primary care setting.
AB  - METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a random sample of patients (n=50-150 per site) aged 40-89 years with diagnosed COPD. Patients were identified for study inclusion (N=1517) from 11 US primary care sites. Demographic and clinical information was extracted from primary care medical records via retrospective chart review. The main outcome measures were adherence to GOLD primary care guidelines, assessed via three components as follows: 1. Is there a current diagnostic spirometry test measurement available within the patient's medical record during the prior calendar year? 2. Are comorbid conditions, if present, being treated appropriately? 3. Are adequate risk reduction measures being taken?
AB  - RESULTS: Mean patient age was 67.2 (SD+/-11.3) years, 54% were female, and 34% were current smokers. Overall, 19% of patients had comorbid asthma, 66% hypertension, 61% dyslipidemia, 30% cardiovascular disease, and 28% diabetes. Mean duration of COPD was approximately 4.8 years. Only 27% of patients had a spirometry test result documented within the past year. More than half (52%) of patients did not have a documented COPD stage; 20% were classified as stage I, 13% stage II, 12% stage III, 3% stage IV. About 63% of patients met at least one guideline component, while only 3% of patients met all components; 27% met diagnostic, 25% comorbid conditions management, and 32% met risk reduction criteria.
AB  - LIMITATIONS: The retrospective design of our study did not allow evaluation of some possible covariates or causal assessment, and spirometry measurements were unavailable for many patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that treatment per COPD primary care guidelines was not consistently applied among participating practices (range 0.0%-8.7% for meeting all three components). Educational initiatives may increase primary care providers' knowledge of and adherence to COPD treatment guidelines and recommended patient management strategies.

TI  - Improving drug adherence using fixed combinations caused beneficial treatment outcomes and decreased health-care costs in patients with hypertension.
AB  - We enrolled 196 patients with hypertension who were already being treated with free-drug combinations of angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) and amlodipine. The free-drug combinations of ARB and amlodipine were replaced with the same dose of the fixed-dose combinations. The average home blood pressure (BP) in all patients receiving fixed-dose combinations was significantly lower than those receiving free-drug combinations (131 +/- 10/75 +/- 8 vs. 136 +/- 11/77 +/- 9 mm Hg, P < .01) accompanied with increasing drug adherence. After lowering BP by fixed-dose combinations, the costs for medications decreased by 31% over the 3 months.

TI  - [Relationship of polymedication in controlling blood pressure: compliance, persistence, costs and incidence of new cardiovascular events]. [Spanish]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship of polypharmacy on blood pressure (BP) control, compliance, persistence, the cost and incidence of cardiovascular events (CVD) in patients with moderate/severe hypertension.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational multicenter retrospective study. We evaluated patients > 30 years who started a third antihypertensive treatment during 2004-2006. Depending on the number of chronic medications, we established 3 groups: regular consumption of 3-6 drugs, including between 7-10 and > 11. Top-measures: sociodemographic, comorbidity, BP, compliance and persistence. For each group we determined the incidence of new CVD totals and total costs.
AB  - RESULTS: We evaluated 1,906 patients, 765 between 3-6 drugs, 624 between 7-10 and 517 in > 11 (P<.001). Overage age: 69.4 years and 55.5% women. The group of 3-6 drugs showed better BP control (51.8 vs. 47.0 and 41.1%, P<.001), compliance (71.4 vs. 69.9 and 67.1%, P=.017), persistence (50.1 vs. 45.5 and 46.2%, P=.044) and lower incidence of CVD (12.2 vs. 19.7 and 30.2%, P<.001), respectively. The average/unit total costs was 3,369.1 vs. 4,362.1 and  4,902.3 (P<.001). The presence of CVD was associated with therapy noncompliance (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.1 to 3.6) and controlled by the lower BP control (OR 1.4 (95%CI 1.1-2.0) (P < .05). The use of antihypertensive fixed dose has greater compliance (72.8 vs. 68.2%), persistence (64.4 vs. 39.3%) and degree of BP control (52.6 vs. 43, 8%) (p<.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy is associated with lower compliance and persistence to antihypertensive treatment, cardiovascular disease and increased health care costs.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

TI  - Disparities in antihypertensive medication adherence in adolescents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects up to 5 % of all children, but little is known about the role of medication adherence on blood pressure (BP) control. In this study we examined the association between adolescents' antihypertensive medication adherence and BP control, investigating for racial disparities.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 21 adolescents with essential hypertension [mean age 14.7 +/- 2.0 years, 57 % male, 52 % African American] were recruited from a pediatric nephrology clinic. Objective medication adherence measures were obtained with Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps and pharmacy refill records to determine medication possession ratios (MPRs).
AB  - RESULTS: The African Americans adolescents had lower medication adherence than non-African Americans adolescents based on the MPR over the past 12 months (mean 0.54 +/- 0.21 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.16, respectively; p < 0.001) and a trend for less adherence measured by MEMS caps over the last 28 days (mean 0.75 +/- 0.26 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.04, respectively; p < 0.07). Seven of the eight participants with low adherence (MPR <0.65) had uncontrolled BP (systolic and/or diastolic BPs > 95th percentile), and no participants with high adherence according to the MPR had uncontrolled BP (p < 0.001). There was no difference in BP control by race.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive medication adherence measured by pharmacy refills was associated with BP control. AAs were more likely to have lower medication adherence. Targeting medication adherence through the use of electronic medical records may be a potential mechanism to reduce health disparities.

TI  - The Cholesterol, Hypertension, And Glucose Education (CHANGE) study: results from a randomized controlled trial in African Americans with diabetes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes account for one-third of the mortality difference between African American and white patients. We evaluated the effect of a CVD risk reduction intervention in African Americans with diabetes.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized 359 African Americans with type 2 diabetes to receive usual care or a nurse telephone intervention. The 12-month intervention provided monthly self-management support and quarterly medication management facilitation. Coprimary outcomes were changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) over 12 months. We estimated between-intervention group differences over time using linear mixed-effects models. The secondary outcome was self-reported medication adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: The sample was 72% female; 49% had low health literacy, and 37% had annual income <$10,000. Model-based estimates for mean baseline SBP, HbA1c, and LDL-C were 136.8 mm Hg (95% CI 135.0-138.6), 8.0% (95% CI 7.8-8.2), and 99.1 mg/dL (95% CI 94.7-103.5), respectively. Intervention patients received 9.9 (SD 3.0) intervention calls on average. Primary providers replied to 76% of nurse medication management facilitation contacts, 18% of these resulted in medication changes. There were no between-group differences over time for SBP (P = .11), HbA1c (P = .66), or LDL-C (P = .79). Intervention patients were more likely than those receiving usual care to report improved medication adherence (odds ratio 4.4, 95% CI 1.8-10.6, P = .0008), but adherent patients did not exhibit relative improvement in primary outcomes.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This intervention improved self-reported medication adherence but not CVD risk factor control among African Americans with diabetes. Further research is needed to determine how to maximally impact CVD risk factors in African American patients.Copyright © 2013 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effectiveness of a pharmacist-led drug counseling on enhancing antihypertensive adherence and blood pressure control: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - Adherence to antihypertensive medications represents a crucial success factor for optimal blood pressure (BP) control in clinical practice. This study evaluated whether an additional pharmacist-led medication counseling could achieve better optimal BP control and enhance compliance. In a designated family clinic in a region with similar resident characteristics to Hong Kong, patients taking > one antihypertensive agent with suboptimal compliance were randomly allocated to a brief 3-minute drug advice (control; n=161) or pharmacist counseling (intervention; n=113). The two groups were compared by repeated measure ANOVA at 3-months and 6-months with BP control and medication compliance as outcome variables, respectively. The proportions of patients having optimal compliance increased from 0% to 41.1% at 3 months and 61.9% at 6 months (P<0.001). The proportion of patients having optimal BP control improved from 64.1% at baseline to 74.0% at 3 months and 74.5% at 6 months (P=0.023). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the changes of BP control and compliance levels. This study implied that even a brief 3-minute drug advice might lead to improved BP levels among patients on antihypertensive medications in general practice, but did not demonstrate additional effects by pharmacist counseling.

TI  - Adherence to Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of metabolic syndrome: a 6-year prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Benefits of Mediterranean diet on MetS risk have been suggested, but overall prospective evidence in the general population is limited. For the first time, the prospective association of adherence to Mediterranean diet with the 6-y risk of MetS and its components was evaluated in a large cohort in Europe.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects included were participants from the Supplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux AntioXydants (SU.VI.MAX) study. Adherence to Mediterranean diet was assessed using traditional Mediterranean diet score (MDS), an updated Mediterranean score (MED) and Mediterranean style-dietary pattern score (MSDPS) calculated from at least three 24-h records. In 3232 subjects, the association between Mediterranean diet scores and 6-y risk of MetS was evaluated. The association between Mediterranean scores and MetS components was also estimated. A lower risk of MetS was observed with increasing MED score (P-trend = 0.001) and MDS (P-trend = 0.03) in multivariate models. The adjusted odds ratios (95% Confidence Interval) for MetS risk were 0.47 (0.32-0.69) and 0.50 (0.32-0.77) in subjects in the highest versus lowest tertile of MED score and MDS, respectively. The MED score was inversely associated with waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and triglycerides, and directly associated with HDL-cholesterol. The MDS was negatively associated with waist circumference and triglycerides, and MSDPS was positively associated with HDL-cholesterol.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: All Mediterranean diet scores were associated in a potentially beneficial direction with components of MetS or MetS incidence. Our findings support that individuals should be encouraged to follow a Mediterranean dietary pattern for reduction of MetS risk.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mobilizing your medications: an automated medication reminder application for mobile phones and hypertension medication adherence in a high-risk urban population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension frequently accompanies diabetes mellitus, worsening prognosis and complicating medical care for patients. Low medication adherence with multiple medications is a major factor in the inadequate achievement of blood pressure treatment goals. Widespread access to mobile phones offers a new opportunity to communicate with patients and enhance disease self-management.
AB  - METHODS: We recruited 50 high-risk urban patients with hypertension, who are using at least two prescription medications for hypertension, into an open-label trial using medication reminder software on a mobile phone. Medication adherence was assessed by review of pharmacy refill rates before, during, and after availability of the medication reminder software (pre-activation, activation, and post-activation phase, respectively).
AB  - RESULTS: Forty-eight patients completed the study. All subjects were insured by Medicaid, 96% were African-American, and the majority had diabetes mellitus. The proportion of days covered for each study phase was as follows: pre-activation phase = 0.54, activation phase = 0.58, and post-activation phase = 0.46. A significant difference was found between the activation and post-activation phases (p = .001). The increase in measured adherence between the pre-activation and activation phases approached significance (p = .057). Forty-six patients completed the pre- and post-Morisky medication adherence survey. The median score rose from 2.0 at baseline to 3.0 at study completion (p < .001). Average blood pressure and level of control during study period improved significantly after initiation of the study and remained improved from baseline through the course of the study. The 48 subjects who completed the study reported a high level of satisfaction with the medication reminder application at the final study visit.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A mobile-phone-based automated medication reminder system shows promise in improving medication adherence and blood pressure in high-cardiovascular-risk individuals.Copyright © 2013 Diabetes Technology Society.

TI  - Effects of an interdisciplinary education program on hypertension: A pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this pilot study was to examine the effects of a structured interdisciplinary education program on blood pressure, knowledge, anthropometric measures, medication compliance, behavioural risk factors and quality of life.
AB  - METHOD: In this quasi-experimental study, participants were assigned to an intervention (n = 21) or a regular care group (n = 19). The intervention group attended four weekly sessions related to hypertension. Anthropometric measures and blood pressure were recorded at baseline, one, three and six months for all participants. Both groups completed questionnaires on knowledge, health-related behaviours and quality of life at these same intervals.
AB  - RESULTS: The reduction in systolic blood pressure was greater in the intervention group than in the regular care group (p = 0.05). However, there were no between group differences with regard to the other variables studied.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Participation in a structured interdisciplinary education program was associated with a reduction of systolic blood pressure, thus contributing to a risk reduction for cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Antihypertensive response to combination of olmesartan and amlodipine does not depend on method and time of drug administration.
AB  - Fixed combinations of antihypertensive drugs have the potentiality to improve blood pressure (BP) control. However, when pharmacokinetic parameters of the two drugs are different, both method and time of administration of the two drugs may modify the antihypertensive response. In an open-label, single-blind, randomized study we compared antihypertensive effect of four administration schemes of a combination therapy of olmesartan and amlodipine in the same group of hypertensive patients, using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The olmesartan + amlodipine combination has demonstrated to provide a good control of BP, with systolic and diastolic BP constantly below 130 and 85 mmHg over the 24 h. The simultaneous or separate administration of the 2 drugs fully overlapped, suggesting that the fixed combination and the separate administration induce a similar and sustained BP control.

TI  - Hypertensive patients' experience with adherence therapy for enhancing medication compliance: a qualitative exploration.
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the experience of non-compliant hypertensive patients who had received seven sessions of adherence therapy (AT) as part of a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: AT is a patient-centred approach used to explore patient attitudes, beliefs and discrepancy toward medications that aimed to enhance patients' medication-taking behaviour.
AB  - DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with patients who had completed an AT intervention.
AB  - METHODS: A convenience sample of 10 hypertensive patients who received AT as part of an exploratory randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN99494659) were included. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews exploring patient's views and experiences of AT was used.
AB  - RESULTS: Five major themes of AT emerged; modifying attitudes and beliefs, positive impact on self efficacy, therapist motivation, positive impact on well-being and a well-designed intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: patients' views about the benefit of AT were entirely consistent with our proposed mechanism of action for this intervention; that is by improving patient's beliefs and attitudes regarding taking drugs, and finding solutions to barriers that prevent adherence, patients become more complaint with their medication which in turn has a positive impact on clinical outcomes [i.e. blood pressure, hypertension complication (stroke, myocardial infarction, and recurrent hospitalisation)].
AB  - RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Exploring patients' experience with AT and recognising these five elements help in tailoring a new effective strategy according to individual needs for enhancing adherence to prescribed drugs.Copyright © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Treatment goals for ambulatory blood pressure and plasma lipids after stroke are often not reached.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Danish health care, secondary prevention after stroke is currently handled mainly by general practitioners using office blood pressure (OBP) assessment of hypertension. The aim of this study was to compare the OBP approach to 24-hour assessment by ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring. Furthermore, we aimed to record the degree of adherence to recommended therapy goals for blood pressure and plasma lipids.
AB  - MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a prospective observational study, 45 stroke patients aged 25-64 years who were participating in specialized intensive outpatient rehabilitation were monitored by OBP and ABP on average 1.3 (0.14-4.3) years post stroke. Furthermore, data on additional risk factors and medication for secondary prevention were collected.
AB  - RESULTS: OBP and daytime ABP exceeded the therapy goal of 130/80 mmHg in 71% and 44% of the patients, respectively. ABP exceeded the night-time therapy goal of 115/65 in 57% of cases. Normal dipping at night was found in only 41% (systolic) and 32% (diastolic) of the patients. Considering both day- and night-time blood pressure, antihypertensive medication was absent or inadequate in 60%. Low density lipid (LDL) levels exceeded the recommended limit of 2.5 mmol/l in 49%.
AB  - CONCLUSION: For blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol, secondary prevention is far from ideal in post-stroke patients. Compared with OBP, ABP demands more resources, but in turn yields more reliable results and also provides important information about diurnal BP variation. ABP monitoring at least once after stroke should therefore be implemented routinely.

TI  - The effects of arterial blood pressure reduction on endocan and soluble endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and CAMs ligands expression in hypertensive patients on Ca-channel blocker therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine the effect of arterial blood pressure (BP) reduction on endocan and soluble cell adhesion molecules' (sCAM) plasma concentration and expression of their ligands on circulatory leukocyte subpopulations.
AB  - METHODS: 24 hypertensive subjects of both sexes (age: 53+/-8 yrs) were treated with Ca-channel blocker, amlodipin (5-10 mg/day for 8 weeks; to reach BP<139/89mmHg). The serum sCAMs and endocan concentrations were determined by ELISA kits. Level of ICAM/VCAM ligands on leukocytes was assessed by flow cytometry. Paired t-test, or t-test were used as appropriate, with Pearson's correlation calculated; p<0.05 was considered significant (SigmaPlot v.11).
AB  - RESULTS: sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were decreased (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively), while E-selectin concentration was increased after amlodipin treatment (P=0.014). CD11a/LFA-1 (ICAM-1 and endocan ligand) was significantly increased in all three cell types with BP decrease. CD15 and CD49d/VLA-4 (VCAM-1 ligand) did not change after the treatment. There was significant positive correlation of systolic and diastolic BP with ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and significant negative correlation of systolic BP with CD11a/LFA-1. Endocan significantly positively correlated with ICAM-1.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The increased expression of ICAM/VACM ligands, together with decrease of sCAMs and endocan suggests the de-activation of endothelium with reduction in BP, decreasing the adherence of circulatory leukocytes to endothelium; subsequently decreasing the risk for development of atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2013 S.

TI  - Virgin olive oil supplementation and long-term cognition: the PREDIMED-NAVARRA randomized, trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect on cognition of a controlled intervention testing Mediterranean diets (MedDiet).
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized trial after 6.5 years of nutritional intervention.
AB  - SETTING: Eight primary care centers affiliated to the University of Navarra.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A random subsample of 285 participants (95 randomly allocated to each of 3 groups) of the PREDIMED-NAVARRA trial. All of them were at high vascular risk (44.8% men, 74.1+/-5.7 years at cognitive evaluation).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Nutritional intervention comparing two MedDiets (supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil [EVOO] or mixed nuts) versus a low-fat control diet. Participants received intensive education to increase adherence to the intended intervention. Participants allocated to the MedDiet groups received EVOO (1 l/week) or 30 g/day of mixed nuts. Dietary habits were evaluated using a validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Additionally, adherence to MedDiet was appraised using a 14-item questionnaire both at baseline and yearly thereafter.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive performance as a main outcome and cognitive status (normal, mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or dementia) as a secondary outcome were evaluated by two neurologists blinded to group assignment after 6.5 years of nutritional intervention.
AB  - RESULTS: Better post-trial cognitive performance versus control in all cognitive domains and significantly better performance across fluency and memory tasks were observed for participants allocated to the MedDiet+EVOO group. After adjustment for sex, age, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, family history of cognitive impairment/dementia, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, alcohol and total energy intake, this group also showed lower MCI (OR=0.34 95% CI: 0.12-0.97) compared with control group. Participants assigned to MedDiet+Nuts group did not differ from controls.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A long-term intervention with an EVOO-rich MedDiet resulted in a better cognitive function in comparison with a control diet. However, non-significant differences were found for most cognitive domains. Participants allocated to an EVOO-rich MedDiet had less MCI than controls.

TI  - Reducing cardiovascular medication complexity in a German university hospital: effects of a structured pharmaceutical management intervention on adherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient adherence is necessary for successful medication therapy. However, highly complex medication regimens may lead to poor adherence, which decreases the effectiveness of treatment and often results in treatment failure, excessive morbidity and mortality, and higher costs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patient adherence can be increased indirectly through reducing medication complexity by (a) pharmaceutical counseling of hospital medical staff and (b) additional information in the discharge letter for the primary care provider (PCP) about the simplified discharge medication.
AB  - METHODS: At the Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, a tertiary care university hospital in Germany, 240 chronically ill inpatients with hypertension, diabetes, and/or dyslipidemia were enrolled in this prospective, semirandomized study. For the intervention group, hospital doctors were counseled by a clinical pharmacist on feasible simplifications of cardiovascular and antidiabetic medications. In 1 randomized subgroup, the PCP received additional explanatory information in the discharge letter. Adherence (self-reporting using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale [MARS-D]) and medication complexity (using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index [MRCI-D]) were recorded at admission to the hospital, discharge from the hospital, and 6 weeks after discharge. Patient quality of life (QoL) and satisfaction with information about medications were assessed at admission and after discharge.
AB  - RESULTS: At discharge, the medication regimen in the intervention group was significantly less complex than in the comparison group. Yet, 6 weeks  after discharge, the complexity of the outpatient medication had increased to values similar to the comparison group, unless the PCP received additional information in the discharge letter. Propensity adjusted complete adherence rates at discharge were slightly, but not significantly, higher in the intervention group than in the comparison group. Within the intervention group, complete adherence was more frequent in the subgroup with additional information for the PCP. Patient QoL and satisfaction with information were comparable in both groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The complexity of cardiovascular and antidiabetic hospital medications can be reduced by counseling the hospital doctors. However, for a sustainable simplification of outpatient medication, the PCPs must receive explicit information about the modifications. Patient adherence was not significantly influenced by this intervention. To verify these results, further research with objective measures of adherence and in patients with other diseases is needed.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of two ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide fixed-dose combination formulations in adults with stage 1 or stage 2 arterial hypertension evaluated by using ABPM.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fixed-dose combinations of antihypertensive agents demonstrate advantages in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and treatment adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) fixed-dose combinations in patients with hypertension stage 1 or 2. Patients' blood pressure (BP) profiles were evaluated by using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM).
AB  - METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, noninferiority trial of adult patients (age >18 years) with hypertension stage 1 or 2 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) within 140 to 179 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 to 109 mm Hg. After a 2-week washout period, eligible patients were randomized to receive 1 of 2 ramipril/HCTZ fixed-dose combination formulations (5/25 mg/d) for 8 weeks. The primary end point was the difference in 24-hour ABPM SBP/DBP mean reductions between groups after 8 weeks of treatment. The secondary end points were the changes in daytime and nighttime ABPM and in office BP. Safety profile and tolerability assessments included monitoring of adverse events.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 102 patients with hypertension (54 in group A [test formulation] and 48 in group B [reference formulation]), aged 27 to 85 years, completed the 8-week treatment period. The decreases in SBP and DBP according to 24-hour ABPM from baseline to week 8 were significant and similar in both groups. SBP decreased from 149.1 to 133.0 mm Hg (-16.1 mm Hg) in group A and from 146.2 to 130.6 mm Hg in group B (-15.6 mm Hg) (P = 0.8537); DBP was reduced by 8.8 mm Hg in group A and by 8.5 mm Hg in group B (P = 0.8748). Because the lower 95% CI limit for the difference between groups A and B of 3.96 mm Hg in SBP and 3.54 mm Hg in DBP was lower than that preestablished by the trial protocol (4 mm Hg), noninferiority of the test formulation was demonstrated compared with the reference formulation. For the secondary end points, there was no significant difference between groups in SBP and DBP during daytime or nighttime at the end of week 8. Office BP was significantly reduced in both treatment groups, with no significant differences between groups. The incidence of adverse events was 23.7% in group A and 21.7% in group B.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Both treatment options were well tolerated and equally reduced BP. The results support the conclusion that group A (new fixed-dose combination of ramipril/HCTZ) was noninferior to group B (reference medication in Brazil).

TI  - Tailored interventions to improve hypertension management after stroke or TIA--phase II (TIMS II).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduction of blood pressure (BP) after stroke or TIA decreases stroke recurrence and is a major goal ofsecondary Stroke Prevention Clinics (SPCs). Health care providers need effective screening processes to identify those clients at highest risk of not achieving BP targets and those clients at highest risk ofnon-adherence to medication.
AB  - METHODS: This multicentred, randomized controlled study used a screening process to identify SPC patients with psychosocial/cognitive deficits (e.g., lack of confidence in the utility of medications, poor memory, mild cognitive impairment) who were experiencing difficulty managing their BP to target values and evaluated whether a model of nurse-led case management program (monthly telephone calls, motivational interviewingfor lifestyle change, plus home BP monitoring and use ofdosettes for medication administration) would improve BP measures and adherence to medications.
AB  - RESULTS: Both intervention (n=29) and usual care groups (n=27) showed a trend-for'reduced BP at six months (Median ql-q3, Systolic BR p=0.46; Diastolic BR p=0.37). Diabetic patients, irrespective of the group to which they were randomized, were less likely to meet Best Practice Guideline targets than those without diabetes (Chi Square test, p=0.0001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Stroke and TIA patients with diabetes may require additional resources and support in order to reach BP target values.

TI  - Pilot trial of a licensed practical nurse intervention for hypertension and depression.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Depression is a risk factor for hypertension, and risk of depression is increased substantially in patients with hypertension. Our objective was to examine whether an intervention carried out by Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) integrating depression treatment into care for hypertension improved blood pressure control and depressive symptoms.
AB  - METHODS: In all, 60 patients ages 41 to 92 years with hypertension and depressive symptoms at a large primary care practice in Philadelphia were randomly assigned to an integrated care intervention carried out by LPNs (n=30) or usual care (n=30). Intervention and control groups did not differ statistically on baseline measures. Outcomes assessed at baseline and 12 weeks included standard laboratory procedures to measure blood pressure control and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients in the integrated care intervention had lower diastolic blood pressure (intervention 74.2 mmHg versus usual care 82.0 mmHg) and fewer depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 mean scores, intervention 2.4 versus usual care 7.1) compared with patients in the usual care group at 12 weeks after adjustment for baseline values. Patients in the integrated care intervention also had lower systolic blood pressure (intervention 130.0 mmHg versus usual care 140.6 mmHg) compared with patients in the usual care group at 12 weeks although the results approached but did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Training existing primary care practice office staff will facilitate implementation in real world practices with limited resources and competing demands.

TI  - Favourable effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet on glucose tolerance and lipid profiles in gestational diabetes: a randomised clinical trial.
AB  - Although gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with an increased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity, there is no consensus as to the optimal approach of nutritional management in these patients. The present study was designed to assess the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan on glucose tolerance and lipid profiles of pregnant women with GDM. The present randomised controlled clinical trial was performed among thirty-four women diagnosed with GDM at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume either the control diet (n 17) or the DASH eating pattern (n 17) for 4 weeks. The control diet was designed to contain 45-55% carbohydrates, 15-20% protein and 25-30% total fat. The macronutrient composition of the DASH diet was similar to the control diet; however, the DASH diet was rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products, and contained lower amounts of saturated fats, cholesterol and refined grains with a total of 2400 mg Na/d. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention to measure fasting plasma glucose, glycated Hb (HbA1c) and lipid profiles. Participants underwent a 3 h oral glucose tolerance tests and blood samples were collected at 60, 120 and 180 min to measure plasma glucose levels. Adherence to the DASH eating pattern, compared with the control diet, resulted in improved glucose tolerance such that plasma glucose levels reduced at 60 (21.86 v. 20.45 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.02), 120 (22.3 v. 0.2 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.001) and 180 min (21.7 v. 0.22 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.002) after the glucose load. Decreased HbA1c levels (20.2 v. 0.05 %, Pgroup = 0.001) was also seen in the DASH group compared with the control group. Mean changes for serum total (20.42 v. 0.31 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.01) and LDL-cholesterol (20.47 v. 0.22 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.005), TAG (20.17 v. 0.34 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.01) and total:HDL-cholesterol ratio (20.6 (SD 0.9) v. 0.3 (SD 0.8), Pgroup = 0.008) were significantly different between the two diets. Additionally, consumption of the DASH diet favourably influenced systolic blood pressure (22.6 v. 1.7 mmHg, Pgroup = 0.001). Mean changes of fasting plasma glucose (20.29 v. 0.15 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.09) were nonsignificant comparing the DASH diet with the control diet. In conclusion, consumption of the DASH eating pattern for 4 weeks among pregnant women with GDM resulted in beneficial effects on glucose tolerance and lipid profiles compared with the control diet.

TI  - Blood pressure treatment adherence and control through 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) is an important cardiovascular risk factor, blood pressure level control often remains inadequate. Assessment of adherence to antihypertensive treatment through 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) may represent an important aid in the search for BP control targets.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess adherence to antihypertensive treatment and its association with BP values at 24-hour ABPM in hypertensive patients treated in primary health care (PHC) centers.
AB  - METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study of 143 hypertensive patients, who constituted a representative sample of patients from PHC centers in the town of Antonio Prado, RS. The Morisky-Green test was used to evaluate adherence and verify the number of medications used by patients, followed by 24-hour ABPM.
AB  - RESULTS: We observed that 65.7% of the sample was considered adherent to the proposed treatment, 20.3% were moderately adherent and only 14% were classified as non-adherent. Considering all the 143 patients evaluated, 79 (55.2%) were identified as having controlled hypertension (<130/80 mmHg) according to the 24-hour ABPM measurements, 64 (44.8%) were considered uncontrolled (>130/80 mmHg), 103 (72%) had absence of nocturnal BP dip and 60 (41.9%) were uncontrolled while awake.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed a lack of adequate hypertension control with a consequent loss of opportunity for PHC professionals to adequately adjust the recommended BP control targets. This fact occurs in spite of proper adherence to antihypertensive treatment by patients in PHC centers.

TI  - Long-term safety and efficacy of telmisartan/amlodipine single pill combination in the treatment of hypertension. [Review]
AB  - The use of multiple drug regimens is increasingly recognized as a tacit requirement for the management of hypertension, a necessity fueled in part by rising rates of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. By targeting complementary pathways, combinations of antihypertensive drugs can be applied to provide effective blood pressure control while minimizing side effects and reducing exposure to high doses of individual medications. In addition, combination therapies, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), have the added benefit of reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity over other dual therapies while providing equivalent blood pressure control. It is possible that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which unlike ACE inhibitors are minimally affected by upregulation of alternative pathways for angiotensin II accumulation following long-term treatment, would also provide such outcome benefits. At issue, however, is maintaining patient compliance, as adding medications is known to reduce adherence to treatment regimens. The purpose of this review is to summarize existing trial data for the long-term safety and efficacy of a recent addition to the armamentarium of dual-antihypertensive therapeutic options, the telmisartan/amlodipine single pill combination. The areas where long-term data are lacking, notably clinical information regarding minorities and women, will also be discussed.

TI  - Interactive effects of social support and social conflict on medication adherence in multimorbid older adults.
AB  - With increasing age and multimorbidity, medication regimens become demanding, potentially resulting in suboptimal adherence. Social support has been discussed as a predictor of adherence, but previous findings are inconsistent. The study examines general social support, medication-specific social support, and social conflict as predictors of adherence at two points in time (6 months apart) to test the mobilization and social conflict hypotheses. A total of 309 community-dwelling multimorbid adults (65-85 years, mean age 73.27, 41.7% women; most frequent illnesses: hypertension, osteoarthritis and hyperlipidemia) were recruited from the population-representative German Ageing Survey. Only medication-specific support correlated with adherence. Controlling for baseline adherence, demographics, physical fitness, medication regimen, and attitude, Time 1 medication-specific support negatively predicted Time 2 adherence, and vice versa. The negative relation between earlier medication-specific support and later adherence was not due to mobilization (low adherence mobilizing support from others, which over time would support adherence). Social conflict moderated the medication-specific support to adherence relationship: the relationship became more negative, the more social conflict participants reported. Presence of social conflict should be considered when received social support is studied, because well-intended help might have the opposite effect, when it coincides with social conflict.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Thromboembolic event rate in paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation: data from the GISSI-AF trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few data on the thromboembolic (TE) risk of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) are available. This study aimed to assess the incidence of TE events in paroxysmal and persistent AF.
AB  - METHODS: We performed a subset post hoc analysis of 771 patients with paroxysmal and 463 with persistent AF enrolled in the multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled GISSI-AF trial - comparing the efficacy of valsartan versus placebo in preventing AF recurrences - where the choice of antithrombotic treatment was left to the judgment of the referring physician. TE and major outcome events were centrally validated. AF recurrences were detected by frequent clinic visits and a transtelephonic monitoring device with weekly and symptomatic transmissions.
AB  - RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of patients had a history of hypertension, and the 7.7% had heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or both. The mean CHADS2 score was 1.41+/-0.84. TE and major bleeding events were observed at a low incidence among the overall population at 1-year follow-up (0.97% and 0.81%, respectively). The univariate and multivariable analyses revealed no statistically significant differences in the incidence of TE, major bleeding events or mortality in paroxysmal and persistent AF patients. TE events were more common among women than men (p=0.02). The follow-up examination showed under- or overtreatment with warfarin in many patients, according to guideline suggestions. Warfarin was more frequently prescribed to patients with persistent AF (p<0.0001) and patients with AF recurrences (p<0.0001). AF recurrences were noninvasively detected in 632 (51.2%) patients. In patients without AF recurrences, the TE event rate was 0.5% versus 1.74%, 1.28%, and 1.18% for those with only symptomatic, only asymptomatic or both symptomatic and asymptomatic AF recurrences, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant, even after adjusting for warfarin treatment and the CHADS2 score (HR 2.93; CI 95%; 0.8-10.9; p=0.11).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TE and major bleeding events showed a very low incidence in the GISSI-AF trial population, despite under- or overtreatment with warfarin in many patients. TE events had a similar rate in paroxysmal and persistent AF.

TI  - The Trial Using Motivational Interviewing and Positive Affect and Self-Affirmation in African-Americans with Hypertension (TRIUMPH): from theory to clinical trial implementation.
AB  - This paper describes the application of a translational research model in developing The Trial Using Motivational Interviewing and Positive Affect and Self-Affirmation in African-Americans with Hypertension (TRIUMPH), a theoretically-based, randomized controlled trial. TRIUMPH targets blood pressure control among African-Americans with hypertension in a community health center and public hospital setting. TRIUMPH applies positive affect, self-affirmation, and motivational interviewing as strategies to increase medication adherence and blood pressure control. A total of 220 participants were recruited in TRIUMPH and are currently being followed. This paper provides a detailed description of the theoretical framework and study design of TRIUMPH and concludes with a critical reflection of the lessons learned in the process of implementing a health behavior intervention in a community-based setting. TRIUMPH provides a model for incorporating the translational science research paradigm to conducting pragmatic behavioral trials in a real-world setting in a vulnerable population. Lessons learned through interactions with our community partners reinforce the value of community engagement in research.Copyright © 2013. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Irbesartan/amlodipine: a review of its use in adult patients with essential hypertension not adequately controlled with monotherapy. [Review]
AB  - Combination therapy is often required in patients with hypertension, and fixed-dose single-pill combinations have been shown to provide an easier regimen for patients, improving adherence. Irbesartan/amlodipine (Aprovasc) is an angiotensin-receptor blocker/calcium-channel blocker fixed-dose single-pill combination, whose constituent drugs exert additive effects when coadministered. In two randomized, open-label, multicentre, phase III trials, fixed-dose combination therapy with irbesartan/amlodipine was more effective than continuation of irbesartan or amlodipine monotherapy in patients with hypertension not adequately controlled with initial irbesartan or amlodipine monotherapy; there was a significantly greater decrease from baseline in mean seated home systolic blood pressure (primary endpoint) with the fixed-dose combination. The fixed-dose combination was also associated with a greater decrease in mean seated home diastolic blood pressure and mean seated office systolic and diastolic blood pressure than monotherapy. The fixed-dose combination of irbesartan/amlodipine was well tolerated in these patients; most treatment-emergent adverse events were of mild or moderate severity. The most frequent adverse event was peripheral oedema, generally associated with amlodipine treatment.

TI  - Clinical usefulness and cost effectiveness of home blood pressure telemonitoring: meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review data from randomized controlled studies on the effectiveness of home blood pressure telemonitoring (HBPT) versus usual care with respect to improvement of BP control, healthcare resources utilization and costs, patient's quality of life and adverse events.
AB  - METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for publications in English. The benefit and relative risk (RR) were estimated applying a random-effect model.
AB  - RESULTS: Twenty-three randomized controlled trials with a high level of heterogeneity were selected (7037 patients). Compared to usual care, HBPT improved office SBP by 4.71 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.18, 3.24; P < 0.001] and DBP by 2.45 mmHg (3.33, 1.57; P < 0.001). A larger proportion of patients achieved office BP normalization (<140/90 mmHg nondiabetic patients and <130/80 mmHg diabetic patients) in the intervention group [RR: 1.16 (1.04, 1.29); P < 0.001]. HBPT led to a significantly larger prescription of antihypertensive medications [+0.40 (+0.17,+0.62), P < 0.001], but to therapeutic adherence and rate of office consultations similar to usual care. Healthcare costs were significantly (P < 0.001) larger in the HBPT group [+662.92 (+540.81, +785.04) euros per patient], but were similar to those of the usual care when only medical costs were considered [-12.4 (-930.52, +906.23) euros; P = 0.767]. Use of HBPT helped improving the physical component of quality of life [SF-12 or SF-36 questionnaire: +2.78 (+1.15, +4.41) P < 0.001]. No difference was observed in the risk of adverse events [RR: 1.22 (0.86, 1.71); P = 0.111].
AB  - CONCLUSION: HBPT may represent a useful tool to improve hypertension control and associated healthcare outcomes, although it is still more costly compared with usual care.

TI  - [The FORTISSIMO program: advantages of fixed full dose combination of perindopril arginine and indapamide in the treatment of poorly controlled arterial hypertension]. [Russian]
AB  - In the Russian program FORTISSIMO administration of fixed combination of perindopril arginine/indapamide (10 mg/2.5 mg) in 2120 patients with poorly controlled arterial hypertension instead of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or -receptor antagonists (ARB) with hydrochlorothiazide given separately or in fixed combinations resulted in significant lowering of arterial pressure (AP) and achievement of its target level in 84% of patients. Mean AP was lowered from 177/99 to 130/80 mm Hg in 3 months while substantial reduction down to 149/89 mm Hg occurred just after 2 weeks of treatment. Improvement of compliance to therapy was also noted. Fixed perindopril/indapamide combination was well tolerated and turned out to be effective for AP control irrespective of previously conducted therapy (ACEI or ARB with diuretic).

TI  - Translating basic behavioral and social science research to clinical application: the EVOLVE mixed methods approach.[Erratum appears in J Consult Clin Psychol. 2013 Apr;81(2):230]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a mixed-methods approach to develop and test a basic behavioral science-informed intervention to motivate behavior change in 3 high-risk clinical populations. Our theoretically derived intervention comprised a combination of positive affect and self-affirmation (PA/SA), which we applied to 3 clinical chronic disease populations.
AB  - METHOD: We employed a sequential mixed methods model (EVOLVE) to design and test the PA/SA intervention in order to increase physical activity in people with coronary artery disease (post-percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) or asthma (ASM) and to improve medication adherence in African Americans with hypertension (HTN). In an initial qualitative phase, we explored participant values and beliefs. We next pilot tested and refined the intervention and then conducted 3 randomized controlled trials with parallel study design. Participants were randomized to combined PA/SA versus an informational control and were followed bimonthly for 12 months, assessing for health behaviors and interval medical events.
AB  - RESULTS: Over 4.5 years, we enrolled 1,056 participants. Changes were sequentially made to the intervention during the qualitative and pilot phases. The 3 randomized controlled trials enrolled 242 participants who had undergone PCI, 258 with ASM, and 256 with HTN (n = 756). Overall, 45.1% of PA/SA participants versus 33.6% of informational control participants achieved successful behavior change (p = .001). In multivariate analysis, PA/SA intervention remained a significant predictor of achieving behavior change (p < .002, odds ratio = 1.66), 95% CI [1.22, 2.27], controlling for baseline negative affect, comorbidity, gender, race/ethnicity, medical events, smoking, and age.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The EVOLVE method is a means by which basic behavioral science research can be translated into efficacious interventions for chronic disease populations.

TI  - A telehealth strategy for increasing adherence in the treatment of hypertension in primary care.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study describes and analyzes a telehealth strategy for Family Health Teams (FHTs) providing primary care services. This strategy aimed to increase the adherence to the treatment of hypertension.
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a before-after study that enrolled 21 professionals and 502 hypertensive patients in two of the Family Health Units connected to our Telehealth Center Network. Seminars addressing the treatment adherence of hypertension were offered by Web conferences, for a period of 6 months, to the FHTs. The adherence to antihypertensive drugs, low salt diet, and physical activity was measured by specific questionnaires. The rates of adherence were assessed before and after a continuing education program (CEP). After the telehealth intervention, 17 professionals and 465 patients were re-evaluated.
AB  - RESULTS: The participation in the question and answer session, after the seminar, was significant. The qualitative evaluation of the sessions by FHTs showed 87.5% of great/good. There was a trend toward a greater critical understanding of the results and targets set for the team, although at insignificant levels. The rates of adherence to antihypertensive medication, physical activity, and sodium control, before and after the CEP, were 37.8% versus 46.7% (p<0.004), 90.3% versus 89.9% (p=0.90), and 92.2% versus 96.3% (p<0.001), respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The adherence to antihypertensive drugs and low salt diet improved after the CEP. Preliminarily, this telehealth strategy suggests a positive impact on hypertensive patients.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of enhancing adherence to therapy with blood pressure-lowering drugs in the setting of primary cardiovascular prevention.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of enhancing adherence to blood pressure (BP)-lowering drug therapy in a large population without signs of preexisting cardiovascular (CV) disease.
AB  - METHODS: A cohort of 209,650 patients aged 40 to 79 years resident in the Italian Region of Lombardia and newly treated with BP-lowering drugs during 2000 to 2001 was followed from index prescription to 2007. During the follow-up, the 10,688 patients who experienced a hospitalization for a coronary or cerebrovascular event were identified (outcome). Adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered by the therapy with BP-lowering drugs. The cost-effectiveness of enhancing adherence was measured through the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
AB  - RESULTS: Enhancing adherence from 52% (baseline) to 60% and 80% led to a reduced rate for CV outcomes (from 85 to 83 and 77 events every 10,000 person-year, respectively) and increased the cost for drug therapy (from 1,325k to 1,507k and 1,934k every 10,000 person-year, respectively). The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreased from 76k (95% confidence interval 74k-77k) to 74k (95% confidence interval 72k-75k) for each CV event avoided by enhancing adherence from baseline to 60% and 80%, respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing adherence to BP-lowering medications in the setting of primary CV prevention might offer important benefits in reducing the risk of CV outcome, but at a substantial cost.Copyright © 2013 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

TI  - Impact of monthly prescription cap on medication persistence among patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are among the most prevalent and costly chronic health conditions affecting the U.S. population. Prescription treatments for these conditions are of critical importance to the health of patients, yet suboptimal adherence to prescription treatments for these conditions is not uncommon. While monthly prescription restriction has become a commonly used mechanism to reduce medication utilization, little is known about the effect of this policy on patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a reimbursement limit implemented in the Louisiana Medicaid program that restricted patients receiving 8 prescriptions per month without prior authorization on continuation (persistence) of medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes.
AB  - METHODS: A pre-post design was applied using Medicaid claims data from 2001-2003 to compare medication persistence among patients in Louisiana (LA) to patients in Indiana (IN), a nonequivalent comparator state. Medication persistence was defined as time from treatment initiation to a treatment gap of 30 days or longer. To capture pre-intervention trends in medication persistence, we compared historical "pre-policy" cohorts in LA and IN followed for 10 months prior to policy adoption (March 3, 2002, to December 31, 2002) to "post-policy" cohorts followed for 10 months after policy adoption (March 3, 2003, to December 31, 2003). All incident cohorts were identified using a 6-month washout period. We used Cox-proportional hazard models to compare discontinuation rates in LA and IN across the pre-policy and policy period cohorts.
AB  - RESULTS: The adjusted results showed no differences in persistence during the pre-policy period between LA and IN for any of the 3 chronic conditions. In the post-policy period, patients with hyperlipidemia in LA were 1.13 (95% CI=1.02-1.25; P less than 0.05) times more likely to discontinue their treatment as their IN counterparts, while no significant differences were observed in the hypertension or diabetes cohorts.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our study suggests there is inconclusive evidence that the monthly prescription restriction disrupts the continuation of medications for common chronic health conditions in patients. More research is needed to identify which patients are most vulnerable to the effect of monthly prescription limits and how this policy could potentially affect additional treatment outcomes such as medication adherence, health outcomes, and Medicaid expenditures.

TI  - Impact of a patient-centered pharmacy program and intervention in a high-risk group.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The medication therapy management (MTM) program identified high-risk members in a large employer group and invited them to participate in an MTM program. The intervention consisted of at least 3 consultations with a clinical pharmacist to review and discuss drug therapy. The goal was to improve drug therapy adherence and clinical outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of MTM on plan-paid health care costs, utilization of medical services, overall days supply of targeted medications, and medication possession ratios (MPRs).
AB  - METHODS: The MTM and control group comprised eligible members of a large employer prescription benefit plan who were identified between October 1, 2007, and November 12, 2008, and invited to participate. Control group members were selected from targeted members who declined. After propensity score matching to ensure similarity of groups at baseline, each group had 2,250 members. Baseline comparisons and post-period impact analyses between groups were conducted using bivariate analysis. Post-period analyses used tests for paired comparisons. The MTM and control group members were studied for the year before and after their individual program invitations. We measured pre-post differences between the MTM members and controls in total heath care costs, inpatient visits, emergency room (ER) visits, total days supply, and MPRs for 5 conditions: diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and asthma.
AB  - RESULTS: MTM members significantly reduced their plan-paid health care costs by 10.3% or $977, compared with an increase of 0.7% or $62 in the control group (P=0.048). Inpatient visits in the MTM group decreased by 18.6%, while the control group experienced an increase of 24.2% (P less than 0.001). While both groups had decreases in ER visits, the groups were not significantly different (P=0.399). Average days supply for the MTM group increased by 72.7 days over baseline; for the control group, it decreased by 111.1 days (P less than 0.001). MTM members with hypertension and dyslipidemia had pre-post increases in MPR of 2.29% and 2.10%, respectively, while the control group had decreases of 2.31% and 2.61% (both P less than 0.001). The mean MPRs for members with diabetes, depression, and asthma did not change in either group. Program costs per patient in 2009 were estimated to be $478. The program had a return on investment (ROI) of 2.0 in 2009.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the pharmacist-managed MTM program to reconcile the medication therapies of high-risk patients and improve adherence, as measured by MPR, was effective in reducing total health care costs. The results show that those patients in the intervention group with hypertension and dyslipidemia had significant improvements in medication adherence, as compared with the control group. In fact, the intervention group used significantly more days of therapy in the intervention period, and the control group used significantly fewer days than either group used during the baseline period. MTM interventions were associated with a significant decrease in the MTM members' overall plan-paid health care costs, driven largely by decreases in inpatient utilization and mediated by increases in average days supply and in MPR increases for hypertension and dyslipidemia. Overall, the MTM program was cost-effective. The ROI estimated for this program of 2.0 is only slightly lower than the average disease management ROIs reported in the literature.

TI  - Patient- and physician-level determinants of blood pressure response to treatment in normal weight and overweight patients (the PREVIEW study).
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obesity combined with hypertension places patients at greater risk for target-organ damage and cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to identify physician- and patient-levels determinants of blood pressure (BP) values and predictors of uncontrolled BP through subgroup analysis by body mass index (BMI).
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a subgroup analysis of 3006 patients with High-BMI (BMI >25 kg/m(2); n=2124) and Normal-BMI (BMI<25 kg/m(2); n=882) treated by 504 physicians and enrolled in PREVIEW, a Belgian prospective, multi-center, pharmaco-epidemiological study of 90-day second-line treatment with valsartan. Physician- and patient-level determinants of BP values and BP control were identified by means of hierarchical linear and logistic regression. Blood pressure values and control after 90 days of treatment were consistently lower for the High-BMI group. The 25.5% of variance in 90-day systolic and 28.3% of the variance in 90-day diastolic BP were attributable to physician-level determinants for the High-BMI group; versus 27.3% and 29.8% for the Normal-BMI group (ICC=0.273 and 0.298, respectively). Determinants of 90-day BP values and predictors of uncontrolled BP varied considerably by BMI status.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Several common and unique patient- and physician-level determinants of BP values and control were identified for the High-BMI and Normal-BMI groups. These findings highlight the need for differentiating healthcare interventions to account for patient and physician variables, particularly with respect to effective BP management in vulnerable populations.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Antihypertensive medication nonadherence in black men: direct and mediating effects of depressive symptoms, psychosocial stressors, and substance use.
AB  - Black men suffer disproportionately from hypertension. Antihypertensive medication nonadherence is a major contributor to poor blood pressure control, yet few studies consider how psychosocial functioning may impact black men's medication adherence. The authors examined the direct and mediating pathways between depressive symptoms, psychosocial stressors, and substance use on antihypertensive medication nonadherence in 196 black men enrolled in a clinical trial to improve hypertension care and control. The authors found that greater depressive symptoms were associated with more medication nonadherence (beta=0.05; standard error [SE], 0.01; P<.001). None of the psychosocial stressor variables were associated with antihypertensive medication nonadherence. Alcohol misuse was associated with increased medication nonadherence (beta=0.81; SE, 0.26; P<.01), but it did not mediate the association between depressive symptoms and medication nonadherence. Clinicians should consider screening for depressive symptoms and alcohol misuse if patients are found to be nonadherent and should treat or refer patients to appropriate resources to address those issues.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Blood pressure control and treatment adherence in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome: protocol of a randomized controlled study based on home blood pressure telemonitoring vs. conventional management and assessment of psychological determinants of adherence (TELEBPMET Study).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate blood pressure control and poor adherence to treatment remain among the major limitations in the management of hypertensive patients, particularly of those at high risk of cardiovascular events. Preliminary evidence suggests that home blood pressure telemonitoring (HBPT) might help increasing the chance of achieving blood pressure targets and improve patient's therapeutic adherence. However, all these potential advantages of HBPT have not yet been fully investigated.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The purpose of this open label, parallel group, randomized, controlled study is to assess whether, in patients with high cardiovascular risk (treated or untreated essential arterial hypertension--both in the office and in ambulatory conditions over 24 h--and metabolic syndrome), long-term (48 weeks) blood pressure control is more effective when based on HBPT and on the feedback to patients by their doctor between visits, or when based exclusively on blood pressure determination during quarterly office visits (conventional management (CM)). A total of 252 patients will be enrolled and randomized to usual care (n = 84) or HBPT (n = 168). The primary study endpoint will be the rate of subjects achieving normal daytime ambulatory blood pressure targets (< 135/85 mmHg) 24 weeks and 48 weeks after randomization. In addition, the study will assess the psychological determinants of adherence and persistence to drug therapy, through specific psychological tests administered during the course of the study. Other secondary study endpoints will be related to the impact of HBPT on additional clinical and economic outcomes (number of additional medical visits, direct costs of patient management, number of antihypertensive drugs prescribed, level of cardiovascular risk, degree of target organ damage and rate of cardiovascular events, regression of the metabolic syndrome).
AB  - DISCUSSION: The TELEBPMET Study will show whether HBPT is effective in improving blood pressure control and related medical and economic outcomes in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. It will also provide a comprehensive understanding of the psychological determinants of medication adherence and blood pressure control of these patients.

TI  - Patient-tailored self-management intervention for older adults with hypertension in a nursing home.
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study was to evaluate the effects of a patient-tailored self-management intervention on (1) blood pressure control and (2) self-care behaviour, exercise self-efficacy and medication adherence among Korean older hypertensive patients in a nursing home.
AB  - BACKGROUND:   Little is known about whether a patient-tailored self-management for nursing home residents with hypertension is likely to advance the care of this growing population worldwide.
AB  - DESIGN: A non-equivalent comparison group design.
AB  - METHODS: Forty-seven patients (23 and 24 in the intervention and comparison groups, respectively) participated in the study. No one withdrew during the eight-week study period. Hypertensive patients in the intervention group received health education and tailored individual counselling for eight weeks to enhance the self-management.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 77.4 years. Patients were on hypertensive medications for 11.8 years; only 36 of them took medications without assistance. The baseline comparisons of the patients with and without 8-week intervention did not differ for clinical and demographic variables and outcome measures. Blood pressure decreased when comparing the baseline to eight weeks later from baseline; moreover, blood pressure was significantly reduced only in patients who received the intervention. Self-care behaviour and exercise self-efficacy significantly increased over time only in those who were in the intervention group. However, no significant difference was observed in medication adherence between the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patient-tailored self-management intervention was a practical approach for decreasing blood pressure and increasing self-care behaviour in older hypertensive patients in a nursing home. Further studies are needed to validate these findings using a larger sample with long-term follow-up.
AB  - RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A patient-tailored intervention is feasible not only to empower nursing home residents with hypertension for their care, but also to offer a qualified training and guidelines to nursing home staffs, expanding their professional competence in clinical practice.Copyright © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Diet and exercise adherence and practices among medically underserved patients with chronic disease: variation across four ethnic groups.
AB  - Many factors interact to create barriers to dietary and exercise plan adherence among medically underserved patients with chronic disease, but aspects related to culture and ethnicity are underexamined in the literature. Using both qualitative (n = 71) and quantitative (n = 297) data collected in a 4-year, multimethod study among patients with hypertension and/or diabetes, the authors explored differences in self-reported adherence to diet and exercise plans and self-reported daily diet and exercise practices across four ethnic groups-Whites, Blacks, Vietnamese, and Latinos-at a primary health care center in Massachusetts. Adherence to diet and exercise plans differed across ethnic groups even after controlling for key sociodemographic variables, with Vietnamese participants reporting the highest adherence. Food and exercise options were shaped by economic constraints as well as ethnic and cultural familiarity with certain foods and types of activity. These findings indicate that health care providers should consider ethnicity and economic status together to increase effectiveness in encouraging diverse populations with chronic disease to make healthy lifestyle changes.

TI  - Providers' perspective on diabetes case management: a descriptive study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To address the physicians' perspective on case management (CM) for diabetes.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A nested descriptive study in a randomized controlled trial of diabetic patients who had blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg, glycated hemoglobin >9.0%, or lowdensity lipoprotein level >100 mg/dL. Patients received CM (n = 278) versus usual care over a period of 1 year. Surveys were designed to assess physicians' comfort in working with case managers. At the end of the study physicians whose patients were randomized in the trial were mailed these surveys.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 51 of the 72 providers completed the survey (70.8% response rate). The majority of the providers felt very comfortable working with case managers (91.5 %), found treatment provided by CM to be accurate (93.3%),reported that having case managers increased the likelihood of adherence to the treatment regimens (89.4%), and reported overall improved patient satisfaction with CM (93.5%). Seventy-four percent of the providers reported that working with case managers increased the number of patients who were able to achieve therapeutic goals. Almost all providers (99.74%) reported that they will likely consult case managers for management of poorly controlled diabetes.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Co-managing diabetes patients with nurse case managers did not undermine the providers' perceived professional role. In fact, having CM increased the rate of achieving therapeutic goals among patients with diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  - Physicians' health habits are associated with lifestyle counseling for hypertensive patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VII) recommended lifestyle interventions, either with or without pharmacologic treatment, for all patients with high blood pressure. The objective of this study is to determine the association of physicians' personal habits with their attitudes and behaviors regarding JNC VII lifestyle modification guidelines.
AB  - METHODS: One thousand primary care physicians completed DocStyles 2010, a voluntary web-based survey designed to provide insight into physician attitudes and behaviors regarding various health issues.
AB  - RESULTS: The respondents' average age was 45.3 years, and 68% were male. In regards to physician behavior, 4.0% smoked at least once a week, 38.6% ate >5 cups of fruits and/or vegetables >5 days/week, and 27.4% exercised >5 days/week. When asked about specific types of advice offered to their hypertensive patients, physicians reported recommending that their patients eat a healthy diet (92.2%), or cut down on salt (96.1%), or attain or maintain a healthy weight (94.8%), or limit the use of alcohol (75.4%), or be physically active (94.4%). Collectively, 66.5% made all 5 lifestyle modification recommendations. Nonsmoking physicians were more likely to recommend each lifestyle intervention to their hypertensive patients. Those who exercised at least 1 day per week were more likely to recommend limiting alcohol use.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The probability of recommending all 5 JNC VII interventions was greater for physicians who were nonsmoking and who exercised at least 1 day a week.

TI  - Exenatide once weekly improved glycaemic control, cardiometabolic risk factors and a composite index of an HbA1c < 7%, without weight gain or hypoglycaemia, over 52 weeks.
AB  - AIMS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is often associated with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors such as obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate potential effects of exenatide once weekly (ExQW), a GLP-1 receptor agonist, on glycaemic control and CV risk factors.
AB  - METHODS: This analysis included 675 Intent-to-Treat patients with T2DM [baseline (mean +/- SD) HbA1c, 8.1+/-1.2%; fasting blood glucose (FBG), 166+/-48 mg/dl; weight, 94.3+/-19.4 kg; systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), 129+/-15/78 +/- 9 mmHg; total cholesterol, 178.5+/-41.9 mg/dl; low-density lipoprotein (LDL), 100.1+/-35.0 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein (HDL), 44.5+/-11.6 mg/dl; triglycerides, 155.6+/-3.3 mg/dl; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 32.1+/-19.5 U/l] treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea, and/or thiazolidinedione who received 52 weeks of ExQW in four clinical trials.
AB  - RESULTS: At 52 weeks, ExQW significantly improved HbA1c [mean (SE) change from baseline, -1.3 (0.05)%], FBG [-36.3 (2.02) mg/dl], body weight [-2.6 (0.19) kg], SBP/DBP [-3.6 (0.56) mmHg/-1.2 (0.34) mmHg], total cholesterol, -4.4 (1.33) mg/dl; LDL, -2.6 (1.08) mg/dl; HDL, 1.1 (0.31) mg/dl; triglycerides, -7 (1.6)%], and ALT [-4.3 (0.71) IU/l] concentrations, with greater improvements in patients with elevated analyte levels at baseline. Improvements were observed across a range of background antihyperglycaemia therapies. Of patients completing 52 weeks, 19% achieved the composite American Diabetes Association goal (HbA1c < 7.0%, BP < 130/80 mmHg, LDL<100 mg/dl), compared to 1% at baseline. Nearly half (48%) achieved HbA1c < 7.0% without weight gain or major/minor hypoglycaemia. Nausea was the most frequent adverse event and was predominantly mild. Hypoglycaemia was infrequent, and more common with a sulfonylurea.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: With 52 weeks of ExQW, patients experienced sustained improvements in glycaemic control and CV risk factors, with an increased likelihood of achieving both a clinically relevant composite outcome (HbA1c<7% without weight gain or increased risk of hypoglycaemia) and a composite of key therapeutic goals (HbA1c<7%, BP < 130/80 mmHg, LDL<100 mg/dl).Copyright © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Factors associated with non-adherence to three hypertension self-management behaviors: preliminary data for a new instrument.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians have difficulty in identifying patients that are unlikely to adhere to hypertension self-management. Identifying non-adherence is essential to addressing suboptimal blood pressure control and high costs.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: 1) To identify risk factors associated with non-adherence to three key self-management behaviors in patients with hypertension: proper medication use, diet, and exercise; 2) To evaluate the extent to which an instrument designed to identify the number of risk factors present for non-adherence to each of the three hypertension self-management behaviors would be associated with self-management non-adherence and blood pressure.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of randomized trial data.
AB  - PATIENTS: Six hundred and thirty-six primary care patients with hypertension.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: 1) Demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and health belief-related factors; 2) measures of self-reported adherence to recommended medication use, diet recommendations, and exercise recommendations, all collected at baseline assessment; 3) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
AB  - RESULTS: We identified patient factors associated with measures of non-adherence to medications, diet, and exercise in hypertension. We then combined risk factors associated with >1 adherence measure into an instrument that generated three composite variables (medication, diet, and exercise composites), reflecting the number of risk factors present for non-adherence to the corresponding self-management behavior. These composite variables identified subgroups with higher likelihood of medication non-adherence, difficulty following diet recommendations, and difficulty following exercise recommendations. Composite variable levels representing the highest number of self-management non-adherence risk factors were associated with higher SBP and DBP.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We identified factors associated with measures of non-adherence to recommended medication use, diet, and exercise in hypertension. We then developed an instrument that was associated with non-adherence to these self-management behaviors, as well as with blood pressure. With further study, this instrument has potential to improve identification of non-adherent patients with hypertension.

TI  - Sustained blood pressure-lowering effect of aliskiren compared with telmisartan after a single missed dose.
AB  - Poor adherence to antihypertensive drug treatment is common and is often associated with marked prolongations of the dosing interval. Hence, selecting a treatment that has the potential to provide a sustained blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect is important. The objective of this analysis is to compare the sustained efficacy of aliskiren with telmisartan after a single missed dose. This is part of a 12-week double-blind study conducted in patients with mild to moderate hypertension randomized to once-daily aliskiren 150 mg or telmisartan 40 mg for 2 weeks, force-titrated to double the doses for 10 weeks, followed by placebo for 1 week. The changes in BP from the end of active treatment (EOA) to 48 hours after treatment withdrawal (day 2) were analyzed. Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between the treatment groups. Aliskiren continued to show significantly greater reductions in mean sitting systolic BP (-0.7 vs +1.3 mm Hg; P<.05), 24-hour mean ambulatory systolic BP (-3.6 vs +2.6 mm Hg; P<.01), and 24-hour mean ambulatory diastolic BP (-3.7 vs +0.4 mm Hg; P<.01) compared with telmisartan from EOA to day 2, despite the similar BP reductions from randomization to EOA. In conclusion, aliskiren sustained the BP-lowering efficacy better than telmisartan after a single missed dose.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - A multifaceted prospective memory intervention to improve medication adherence: design of a randomized control trial.
AB  - Adherence to prescribed antihypertensive agents is critical because control of elevated blood pressure is the single most important way to prevent stroke and other end organ damage. Unfortunately, nonadherence remains a significant problem. Previous interventions designed to improve adherence have demonstrated only small benefits of strategies that target single facets such as understanding medication directions. The intervention described here is informed by prospective memory theory and performance of older adults in laboratory-based paradigms and uses a comprehensive, multifaceted approach to improve adherence. It incorporates multiple strategies designed to support key components of prospective remembering involved in taking medication. The intervention is delivered by nurses in the home with an education control group for comparison. Differences between groups in overall adherence following the intervention and 6 months later will be tested. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels also will be examined between groups and as they relate to adherence. Intra-individual regression is planned to examine change in adherence over time and its predictors. Finally, we will examine the association between executive function/working memory and adherence, predicting that adherence will be related to executive/working memory in the control group but not in the intervention group.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The Nigerian antihypertensive adherence trial: a community-based randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research in industrialized countries has demonstrated that a key factor limiting the control of hypertension is poor patient adherence and that the most successful interventions for long-term adherence employ multiple strategies. Very little data exist on this question in low-income countries, wherein medication-taking behavior may be less well developed.
AB  - METHOD: We conducted a treatment adherence trial of 544 patients [mean age ~63 years, mean blood pressure (BP) ~168/92 mmHg] with previously untreated hypertension in urban and rural Nigeria. Eligible participants were randomized to one of two arms: clinic management only, or clinic management and home visits. Both interventions included three elements: a community based, nurse-led treatment program with physician backup; facilitation of clinic visits and health education; and the use of diuretics and a beta blocker as needed. After initial diagnosis, the management protocol was implemented by a nurse with physician backup. Participants were evaluated monthly for 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Medication adherence was assessed with pill count and urine testing. Drop-out rates, by treatment group, ranged from 12 to 28%. Among participants who completed the 6-month trial, overall adherence was high (~77% of participants took >98% of prescribed pills). Adherence did not differ by treatment arm, but was better at the rural than the urban site and among those with higher baseline BP. Hypertension control (BP <140/90 mmHg) was achieved in approximately 66% of participants at 6 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This community-based intervention confirms relatively modest default rates compared with industrialized societies, and suggests that medication adherence can be high in developing world settings in clinic attenders.

TI  - [Abpm and duration of the antihypertensive effect: a study with a new formulation of sustained release losartan (CRONOS)]. [Spanish]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Antihypertensive drugs action should last at least 24 h in order to enhance adherence, with positive impact on CV morbimortality. ABPM allow us to evaluate duration of action of drugs, against placebo, using Trough:Peak Ratio, antihypertensive effect in the last 4 h interdosis, and calculating the rate of BP morning surge. Losartan is an Antagonist At1 with good antihypertensive efficacy and renal, cardiac and cerebrovascular protection. Some studies shows less than 24 hs of action, that suggest twice a day dosing. The merge of a new formulation, Losartan Cronos, a bilayer tablet containing 50 mg of Losartan immediate release (IR) and 50 mg extended release (ER) would allow 24 h coverage, maintaining the previous advantages.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess antihypertensive duration of action of Losartan Cronos in patients with essential hypertension throughout a 24-h dosing interval, using ABPM and response rates, AASI and Smoothness Index.
AB  - METHODS: 97 essential hypertensives, where included and received a single morning dose of Losartan Cronos (50 mg of regular release and 50 mg of controlled and retarded release) during 8 weeks. Performed valid ABPM post placebo and post active treatment. Results Mean age 58 (26-86), 60% women. 63% treatment naive. The mean reduction in BP from baseline to week 8 (end of treatment) was statistically significant for all times analyzed (24 hours, daytime, night-time, and last 4 hours monitoring). There were no significant changes in 24h heart rate. BP morning surge (mmHg/hour) decreased from 4.53 to 3,68 (p=0.03).T:P Ratio was 0.91 for SBP and 1.14 for DBP. Smoothness Index: SBP 2.86 (95% CI 1.84-3.7) - DBP 3.17 (95% CI 2.03-3.9) 19 patients had adverse events, no-one cough, all mild, without discontinuations. Conclusion Losartan Cronos demonstrated efficacy and safety, decreases BP without significant effects in heart rate, it reduces the pulse pressure, and its effect lasts for 24 hs, assessed by T:P ratio, last 4 hours effects, decreasing morning surge, also presenting homogeneous effect, since its Smoothness Index is high. Our results suggests daily monodose administration.

TI  - [Persistence in drug therapy of hypertension among different treatment groups and comparison between fixed-dose combinations of ara II + calcium channel blockers vs ace inhibitors + calcium channel blockers]. [Spanish]
AB  - UNLABELLED: High blood pressure (HBP) is a prevalent and chronic disease, requiring pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic sustainable treatment to achieve control. "Persistence" is the continuity of pharmacological treatments. Knowing the persistence of antihypertensive therapy groups could help prioritize those with better results. The aim is to describe the persistence to antihypertensive therapy in a cohort of patients using different methods and compare the persistence of different pharmacological groups used for hypertension treatment.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational, retrospective cohort using secondary databases obtained during drug dispensing and electronic hospital records from the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires. Adult population with diagnosed hypertension and monitoring for two years.
AB  - RESULTS: Diuretics, beta-blockers and first generation of angiotensin converting enzyme are the groups with the largest fall in persistence. Angiotensin antagonists in monotherapy or in combination with beta-blockers and diuretic second generation showed the best results of persistence. Persistence never reached 60% at 2 years.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite having measure persistence through different methods the results were similar and showed low persistence to antihypertensive therapy. We found no pharmacological extra variables that could explain the persistence in different therapeutic groups.

TI  - Drug utilization and blood pressure control in a population where antihypertensives are given free: effect of policy change.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the current utilization pattern of antihypertensive drugs and blood pressure (BP) control among treated hypertensives where there is a change in payment policy for antihypertensive drugs and to compare with a previous study when drugs were given free in the same setting.
AB  - METHODS: A cross sectional study of hypertensive subjects being followed-up in the medical clinic of International Institute for Tropical Agriculture.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred and sixteen consecutive hypertensive subjects aged 50.9+/-8.6 years were studied. Eighty two (70.7%) of the subjects were fully controlled on the treatment, while 15 (12.9%) were not controlled at all. Systolic BP alone was controlled in 14 (12.1%) while in 5 (4.3%) subjects the Diastolic BP alone was controlled. Systolic BP was 133.4+/-14.0 (106-186) mmHg, while diastolic was 83.5+/-9.1 (59-110) mmHg. Salt use correlated with and was predictive of BP control, r = 0.336 and r2 = 3.383, p=0.001. Frequency of drug use: Diuretics 79.8%, calcium channel blockers (CCB) 51.8%, alpha-methyldopa 21.9%, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 17.5%, beta-blockers 15.8%, vasodilator 1.8%, and prazosin 0.9%.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In this study, twice as many patients as in the previous study had fully controlled blood pressure in spite of the new policy of co-payment. Health education and patient counselling along with availability of free drug could have contributed to improve adherence to antihypertensive drugs. Physicians managing hypertensive patients should pay attention not only to adequate dosing and appropriate combination of drugs but also to health education and patient counselling.

TI  - Study on blood pressure control status and predictors of uncontrolled blood pressure among hypertensive patients under medication.
AB  - Widespread treatment options are available for hypertension, but the target range of blood pressure achieved with treatment has been viewed unsatisfactory worldwide. The study was designed to see what proportion of hypertensive under medication had controlled blood pressure and to analyse basic characteristics of uncontrolled subjects and factors associated with blood pressure control status. Hypertensive subjects under medication for at least 6 months were enrolled. They were interviewed and examined. Baseline characteristics and variables to be tested were recorded. Data analysis was done using SPSS. Among 147 hypertensive patients enrolled in the study 49 (33.33%) had controlled blood pressure and 98 (66.66%) had uncontrolled blood pressure despite medication. Blood pressure control status had no significant correlation with sex (p=0.90). The uncontrolled subjects had mean age more than the mean age of the total enrolled group (53.12 +/- 10.3 years versus 49.09 +/- 10.65 years). Physical activity (p=0.04) and adherence to therapy (p<0.01) had significant positive correlation with blood pressure control. There was significant positive correlation between blood pressure control status and awareness of target blood pressure (p=0.028), awareness of complications of uncontrolled blood pressure (p=0.019) and frequency of blood pressure check up (p<0.01). Blood pressure control in our set up was comparable to previously reported articles. By encouraging patients to adhere to therapy, to adopt physically active life style, creating awareness about the target blood pressure and complications of uncontrolled blood pressure and frequent blood pressure check up can improve the outcome.

TI  - Efficacy of moxibustion for pre- or stage I hypertension: study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and the prevalence of hypertension tends to increase with age. Current treatments for hypertension have adverse side effects and poor adherence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of moxibustion on blood pressure in individuals with pre- or stage I hypertension.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Forty-five subjects with pre- or stage I hypertension will be randomized into three groups: treatment group A (2 times/week), treatment group B (3 times/week), and the control group (non-treated group). The inclusion criteria will be as follows: (1) aged between 19 and 65 years; (2) prehypertension or stage I hypertension (JNC 7, Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure); (3) the participants are volunteers and written consent obtained.The participants in the treatment group A will undergo indirect moxibustion 2 times per week for 4 weeks, and the participants in the treatment group B will undergo indirect moxibustion 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The participants in the control group (non-treated group) will maintain their current lifestyle, including diet and exercise. The use of antihypertensive medication is not permitted. The primary endpoint will be a change in patient blood pressure. The secondary endpoints will be the body mass index, lipid profile, EuroQol and Heart Rate Variability. The data will be analyzed with the Student's t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p < 0.05).
AB  - DISCUSSION: The results of this study will help to establish the optimal approach for the care of adults with pre- or stage I hypertension.

TI  - Implementation of a web-based tool for patient medication self-management: the Medication Self-titration Evaluation Programme (Med-STEP) for blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Informatics tools may help support hypertension management.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To design, implement and evaluate a web-based system for patient anti-hypertensive medication self-titration.
AB  - METHODS: Study stages included: six focus groups (50 patients) to identify barriers/facilitators to patient medication self-titration, software design informed by qualitative analysis of focus group responses and a six-month single-arm pilot study (20 patients) to assess implementation feasibility.
AB  - RESULTS: Focus groups emphasised patient need to feel confident that their own primary care providers were directly involved and approved of the titration protocol. Physicians required 3.3 +/- 2.8 minutes/patient to create individualised six-step medication pathways for once-monthly blood pressure evaluations. Pilot participants (mean age of 51.5 +/- 11 years, 45% women, mean baseline blood pressure 139/84 +/- 12.2/7.5 mmHg) had five medication increases, two non-adherence self-reports, 52 months not requiring medication changes, 24 skipped months and 17 months with no evaluations due to technical issues. Four pilot patients dropped out before study completion. From baseline to study completion, blood pressure decreased among the 16 patients remaining in the study (8.0/4.7 mmHg, p = 0.03 for both systolic and diastolic pressures).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learned included the benefit of qualitative patient analysis prior to system development and the feasibility of physicians designing individual treatment pathways. Any potential clinical benefits were offset by technical problems, the tendency for patients to skip their monthly self-evaluations and drop outs. To be more widely adopted such systems must effectively generalise to a wider range of patients and be integrated into clinical workflow.

TI  - Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol reporting and goal attainment in primary care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines established non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) as a secondary treatment target. However, non-HDL-C levels are not reported on standard lipid panels by many hospital-based and/or commercial biochemical laboratories.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We determined whether reporting non-HDL-C was associated with improved non-HDL-C goal attainment.
AB  - METHODS: We identified patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or diabetes receiving care within the Veterans Health Administration. We matched a facility that reported non-HDL-C levels on lipid panels (3994 CVD and 5108 diabetes patients) to a facility with similar size, patient complexity, and academic mission that did not report non-HDL-C (4269 CVD and 6591 diabetes patients). We performed patient-level analysis to assess differences in non-HDL-C from baseline to the most recent lipid panel at these facilities.
AB  - RESULTS: Baseline non-HDL-C levels for CVD patients were 114 mg/dL and 107 mg/dL at the reporting and nonreporting facilities, respectively. At 2.3-year follow-up, non-HDL-C levels decreased at both facilities but by a greater amount at the reporting facility (-11 mg/dL vs -3 mg/dL at the nonreporting facility, P < .001). Results remained significant (P < .001) after we adjusted for patient's age, race, gender, illness burden, history of diabetes, hypertension, medication adherence, statin use, number of lipid panels, and number of primary care visits between baseline and follow-up. Reductions were greater among CVD patients with triglycerides >200 mg/dL (-25 mg/dL vs -16 mg/dL at the respective facilities, P = .004). Results were similar in diabetes patients. Reporting was also associated with greater proportions of patients meeting non-HDL-C treatment goal of <130 mg/dL.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Non-HDL-C reporting could improve non-HDL-C goal attainment.Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Achievement of recommended glucose and blood pressure targets in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in clinical practice - study rationale and protocol of DIALOGUE.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes have 2-4 times greater risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than those without, and this is even further aggravated if they also suffer from hypertension. Unfortunately, less than one third of hypertensive diabetic patients meet blood pressure targets, and more than half fail to achieve target HbA1c values. Thus, appropriate blood pressure and glucose control are of utmost importance. Since treatment sometimes fails in clinical practice while clinical trials generally suggest good efficacy, data from daily clinical practice, especially with regard to the use of newly developed anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive compounds in unselected patient populations, are essential. The DIALOGUE registry aims to close this important gap by evaluating different treatment approaches in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with respect to their effectiveness and tolerability and their impact on outcomes. In addition, DIALOGUE is the first registry to determine treatment success based on the new individualized treatment targets recommended by the ADA and the EASD.
AB  - METHODS: DIALOGUE is a prospective observational German multicentre registry and will enrol 10,000 patients with both diabetes and hypertension in up to 700 sites. After a baseline visit, further documentations are scheduled at 6, 12 and 24 months. There are two co-primary objectives referring to the most recent guidelines for the treatment of diabetes and hypertension: 1) individual HbA1c goal achievement with respect to anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy and 2) individual blood pressure goal achievement with different antihypertensive treatments. Among the secondary objectives the rate of major cardio-vascular and cerebro-vascular events (MACCE) and the rate of hospitalizations are the most important.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The registry will be able to gain insights into the reasons for the obvious gap between the demonstrated efficacy and safety of anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive drugs in clinical trials and their real world balance of effectiveness and safety.

TI  - Protocol for a randomised controlled trial to estimate the effects and costs of a patient centred educational intervention in glaucoma management.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor glaucoma education is thought to be a causative factor of non-adherence to glaucoma therapy. However, the multi-factorial nature of non-adherent behaviour may explain the failure of purely educational interventions to achieve significant improvement in adherence. Behaviour Change Counselling (BCC) allows both the imparting of information and assessment of patient ambivalence to medication use and may elicit behaviour change in order to achieve better adherence. The chronic and complex nature of glaucoma means that patient non-adherence to glaucoma therapy does not easily correlate with measureable objective clinical endpoints. However, electronic medication monitoring offers an objective method of measuring adherence without reliance on clinical endpoints.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with glaucoma (open angle) or ocular hypertension patients attending a glaucoma clinic and prescribed travoprost. The study will determine whether additional glaucoma education using BCC is beneficial and cost effective in improving adherence with glaucoma therapy. An 8-month follow-up period, using an electronic adherence monitoring device (Travalert dosing aid, TDA), will indicate if the intervention is likely to be sustained in the longer term. Additionally, a cost-effectiveness framework will be used to estimate the cost benefit of improving adherence. The development of a novel intervention to deliver glaucoma education using BCC required practitioner training and fidelity testing. Five practitioners were successfully trained to become Glaucoma Support Assistants able to deliver the BCC intervention. The research group had prior clinical and investigative experience in this setting, and used multiple strategies to design a method to address the study objectives.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This RCT, using BCC to improve adherence to ocular hypotensive therapy, to our knowledge is the first within this disease area. Using a variety of adherence measures allows examination of the known inaccuracies of patient self-report with respect to glaucoma medication. The novel BCC component has undergone fidelity testing using BECCI and the BCC template will ensure conformity to a standardised intervention.

TI  - Effectiveness of a short message reminder in increasing compliance with pediatric cataract treatment: a randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Regular follow-up is essential to successful management of childhood cataract. We sought to assess whether a mobile phone short message service (SMS) for parents of children with cataract could improve follow-up adherence and the proportion of procedures performed in timely fashion.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01417819.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: We included 258 parent-child pairs involved in the Childhood Cataract Program of the Chinese Ministry of Health.
AB  - METHODS: Participants were randomized (1:1) to a mobile phone SMS intervention or standard follow-up appointments. All participants were scheduled to attend > 4 follow-up appointments according to the protocol. Parents in the intervention group received SMS automated reminders before scheduled appointments. The control group parents did not receive SMSs or any alternative reminder of scheduled appointments. Regular ocular examinations and analyses were performed by investigators masked to group allocation; however, study participants and the manager in charge of randomization and sending SMSs were not masked.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of follow-up appointments attended, additional surgeries, laser treatments, changes in eyeglasses prescription, and occurrence of secondary ocular hypertension.
AB  - RESULTS: Among parent-child participants, 135 were randomly assigned to the SMS intervention and 123 to standard appointments. Attendance rates for the SMS group (first visit, 97.8%; second, 91.9%; third, 92.6%; fourth, 83%) were significantly higher than those for the control group (first visit, 87.8%; second, 69.9%; third, 56.9%; fourth, 33.3%). The increase in attendance rate for total number of follow-up visits with SMS reminders was 47.2% (relative risk [RR] for attendance, 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.78; P = 0.003). The number needed to remind (NNR) to gain 1 additional visit by 1 child was 3 (95% CI, 1.8-4.2). A total of 247 clinical interventions were carried out in the SMS group and 134 in the control group (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.37-1.99; P = 0.007). The NNR to result in 1 additional clinical intervention was 5 (95% CI, 3.5-6.5).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The SMS reminders significantly improved follow-up adherence in pediatric cataract treatment. Using readily available mobile phone resources may be an effective and economic strategy to improve management of childhood cataract in China.

TI  - Combination therapy with losartan/hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure reduction and goal attainment in a real-world clinical setting in Japan.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: When physicians prescribe a new antihypertensive drug, they do not know the extent of the drug's effect on lowering blood pressure. To resolve this dilemma, a Web-based program was constructed for real-time entry and analysis of treatment. This observational study evaluated the efficacy of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Lo/HCTZ) in lowering blood pressure (BP) and achieving BP target values.
AB  - METHODS: Physicians prescribed Lo/HCTZ for patients with hypertension who failed to achieve target BP values of < 140/90 mmHg and < 130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, respectively, with antihypertensive drugs including an angiotensin receptor blocker.
AB  - RESULTS: From December 2006 to December 2009, the data of 88,254 patients were entered into this database, and the data of 24,825 subjects were analyzed. At the first visit, a total of 88,254 patients received a first prescription of Lo/HCTZ daily. Among these, at the end of the present analysis, 24,825 (28%) outpatients had a follow-up visit at 1 month and 20,726 (23%) outpatients had a follow-up visit at 6 months. The prevalence of hypertensive patients achieving systolic blood pressure (SBP) control (< 140 mmHg) increased over time from 6.9% to 54.3% in females and 6.1% to 52.3% in males (p < 0.05). At the start of the study, the levels of SBP were significantly highest in the eldest patients (> 75 years) followed by the group of 65-75 years and lowest in the youngest patients (< 64 years). However, at the end of the study, there were no differences in levels of SBP among the three groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This Web-based system may provide useful information when a new drug is first released into the market. Treatment with Lo/HCTZ enabled a substantial proportion of hypertensive patients to achieve the recommended goal of < 140/90 mmHg.

TI  - The MAURO study: baseline characteristics and compliance with guidelines targets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Multiple Intervention and Audit in Renal Diseases to Optimize Care (MAURO) study was a cluster randomized controlled trial in 22 renal clinics which aimed to assess the efficacy of a multimodal quality improvement intervention to increase compliance with guideline recommendations for prevention of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and cardiovascular (CV) complications. The trial aimed to test whether this multimodal intervention improved adherence to recommended targets for a series of surrogate indicators relevant to blood pressure (BP) control, sodium intake, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, anemia and calcium-phosphate alterations. The trial also tested whether the same intervention slowed CKD progression and prevented CV complications in CKD patients.
AB  - METHOD: Twenty-two renal clinics were randomized to 2 arms: an intervention arm applying a multimethod quality improvement intervention and a control arm providing standard care. Surrogate indicators were measured to evaluate blood pressure (BP) control, sodium intake, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, anemia and calcium-phosphate alterations.
AB  - RESULTS: Notwithstanding the fact that the vast majority of patients enrolled in this study (95%) were being treated with antihypertensive drugs, BP goals at baseline (specific for proteinuria level and diabetes) were met only in 45% of nonproteinuric patients and in just 14% and 18% of proteinuric and diabetic patients, respectively. The use of diuretics in hypertensive patients was less than what was needed, and about 80% of patients showed a salt excretion >100 mmol/24 hours. Total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were out of target in over 40% of patients, but only about 60% of these were on statins. A large majority of CKD patients were obese or overweight. The proportion of smokers was relatively small (13%), and 37% of patients had quit smoking, indicating patients' awareness of the health risks of smoking.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, management of modifiable risk factors for CKD progression and CV disease could be substantially improved.

TI  - Clinical decision support to improve blood pressure control in hemodialysis patients: a nonrandomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Computer-based clinical decision support aims to improve the quality of patient care. The utility of decision support for improving blood pressure control in hemodialysis patients is unknown.
AB  - METHODS: This was a nonrandomized controlled trial of adult patients receiving chronic in-center hemodialysis during the period of April 1, 2005, to September 30, 2006, in 1 of the 2 major university-based renal programs in Alberta, Canada. Physicians in the intervention center were provided with twice-monthly audits and printed management suggestions based on guideline-recommended blood pressure targets. The same data were available to physicians in the control group but without audit and feedback decision support.
AB  - RESULTS: Eight hundred and thirty hemodialysis patients were receiving dialysis treatment at the time the study was initiated. Preintervention and postintervention blood pressure data were available for 361 patients. The primary outcome, the proportion of postdialysis systolic blood pressures at target over 12 months, did not differ between the intervention and the control programs (unadjusted odds ratio 0.59; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.34-1.02, p = 0.06; adjusted odds ratio 0.62; 95% CI, 0.35-1.11, p = 0.11). There was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in other measures of blood pressure such as the mean change in postdialysis systolic blood pressures (unadjusted mean difference 4 mm Hg, 95% CI, -1 to 9, p = 0.36; adjusted mean difference 2 mm Hg, 95% CI, -1 to 5, p = 0.19).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this population of chronic hemodialysis patients, a computer-based clinical decision support system was not associated with improved blood pressure control.

TI  - Three-month evaluation of dorzolamide hydrochloride/timolol maleate fixed-combination eye drops versus the separate use of both drugs.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the ocular hypotensive effect and safety of dorzolamide hydrochloride 1 %/timolol maleate 0.5 % fixed-combination eye drops.
AB  - METHODS: The study cohort comprised 34 patients with either primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were being concomitantly treated with dorzolamide hydrochloride 1 % eye drops and timolol maleate 0.5 % eye drops. The dorzolamide hydrochloride 1 % and timolol maleate 0.5 % eye drops were replaced with dorzolamide hydrochloride 1 %/timolol maleate 0.5 % fixed-combination eye drops without any washout period. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was evaluated both before and 1 and 3 months after the treatment change. The patients were asked to complete a questionnaire on adherence to the treatment protocol 1 month after the change in treatment.
AB  - RESULTS: The IOP was 15.5 +/- 2.7 mmHg at the time of treatment change, 15.2 +/- 2.7 mmHg at 1 month post-change, and 15.5 +/- 2.9 mmHg at 3 months post-change, which is consistent with that before the treatment change (p = 0.286). Based on the completed questionnaire, following the treatment change, 50 % of patients felt a stinging sensation following administration of the eye drops and 11.8 % experienced blurred vision. In no case were the eye drops discontinued due to adverse reactions or insufficient IOP decrease.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The replacement of concomitant treatment with dorzolamide hydrochloride 1 % and timolol maleate 0.5 % eye drops with dorzolamide hydrochloride 1 %/timolol maleate 0.5 % fixed-combination eye drops improved protocol adherence and preserved the IOP.

TI  - Financial incentives and physician commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension management.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of financial incentives on physician goal commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension care.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Clinic-level cluster-randomized trial with 4 arms: individual, group, or combined incentives, and control.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 83 full-time primary care physicians at 12 Veterans Affairs medical centers completed web-based surveys measuring their goal commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension care every 4 months and telephone interviews at months 8 and 16. Intervention arm participants received performance-based incentives every 4 months for 5 periods. All participants received guideline education at baseline and audit and feedback every 4 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Physician goal commitment did not vary over time or across arms. Participants reported patient nonadherence was a perceived barrier and consistent follow-up was a perceived facilitator to successful hypertension care, suggesting that providers may perceive hypertension management as more of a patient responsibility (external locus of control).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives may constitute an insufficiently strong intervention to influence goal commitment when providers attribute performance to external forces beyond their control.

TI  - Determinants and consequences of adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet in African-American and white adults with high blood pressure: results from the ENCORE trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is an accepted nonpharmacologic treatment for hypertension, little is known about what patient characteristics affect dietary adherence and what level of adherence is needed to reduce blood pressure (BP).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine what factors predict dietary adherence and the extent to which dietary adherence is necessary to produce clinically meaningful BP reductions.
AB  - DESIGN: Ancillary study of the ENCORE (Exercise and Nutrition Interventions for Cardiovascular Health) trial--a 16-week randomized clinical trial of diet and exercise.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants included 144 sedentary, overweight, or obese adults (body mass index 25 to 39.9) with high BP (systolic 130 to 159 mm Hg and/or diastolic 85 to 99 mm Hg).
AB  - INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to one of three groups: DASH diet alone, DASH diet plus weight management, and Usual Diet Controls.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Our primary outcomes were a composite index of adherence to the DASH diet and clinic BP.
AB  - STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: General linear models were used to compare treatment groups on post-treatment adherence to the DASH diet. Linear regression was used to examine potential predictors of post-treatment DASH adherence. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the relation of adherence to the DASH diet and BP.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants in the DASH diet plus weight management (16.1 systolic BP [SBP]; 95% CI 13.0 to 19.2 mm Hg and 9.9 diastolic BP [DBP]; 95% CI 8.1 to 11.6 mm Hg) and DASH diet alone (11.2 SBP; 95% CI 8.1 to 14.3 mm Hg and 7.5 DBP; 95% CI 5.8 to 9.3 mm Hg) groups showed significant reductions in BP in comparison with Usual Diet Controls participants (3.4 SBP; 95% CI 0.4 to 6.4 mm Hg and DBP 3.8; 95% CI 2.2 to 5.5 mm Hg). Greater post-treatment consumption of DASH foods was noted in both the DASH diet alone (mean = 6.20; 95% CI 5.83 to 6.57) and DASH diet plus weight management groups (mean = 6.23; 95% CI 5.88 to 6.59) compared with Usual Diet Controls (mean = 3.66; 95% CI 3.30 to 4.01; P<0.0001), and greater adherence to the DASH diet was associated with larger reductions in clinic SBP and DBP (P < 0.01). Only ethnicity predicted dietary adherence, with African Americans less adherent to the DASH diet compared with whites (4.68; 95% CI 4.34 to 5.03 vs 5.83; 95% CI 5.50 to 6.11; P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Greater adherence to the DASH diet was associated with larger BP reductions independent of weight loss. African Americans were less likely to be adherent to the DASH dietary eating plan compared with whites, suggesting that culturally sensitive dietary strategies might be needed to improve adherence to the DASH diet.Copyright © 2012 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

TI  - Long-term effectiveness of non-drug recommendations to treat hypertension in a clinical setting.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonpharmacological interventions have been efficacious to control blood pressure (BP) in clinical trials, but their long-term effectiveness in clinical practice was still not documented.
AB  - METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 825 patients who received repeated nonpharmacological recommendations to treat hypertension. The outcomes were BP change and rate of BP control by pattern of adherence (informed by the patients) to the recommendations to follow low-salt and low-calorie diets and to do physical activities.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients were followed for 23.1 +/- 8.4 months. Between group deltas of BP change in patients with and without adherence to the low-salt diet, adjusted for baseline BP, body mass index (BMI), age, and number of drugs in use, were 5.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.7-8.6) mm Hg for systolic (P = 0.003) and 2.1 (0.2-3.9) mmHg for diastolic BP (P = 0.02). For adherence to low-calorie diet, the deltas were 6.6 (2.9-10.2) mm Hg (P < 0.001) and 2.0 (0.1-3.9) mm Hg (P = 0.045). Adherence to physical activities was not associated with a BP-lowering effect. Relative risks for a fall of 10 mm Hg in systolic or 5 mm Hg in diastolic BP, with adjustment for confounding, were 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.55-0.87) for adherence to the low-salt diet, 0.83 (0.66-1.05) for low-calorie diet, and 0.99 (0.79-1.24) for exercise.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to low-salt and low-calorie diets is associated with clinically relevant long-term BP reduction and better hypertension control in a clinical setting.

TI  - The effect of enhanced depression care on adherence to risk-reducing behaviors after acute coronary syndromes: findings from the COPES trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of depression after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with worse prognosis and lower adherence to risk-reducing behaviors. We reported earlier that an enhanced depression care intervention reduces depression symptoms and major adverse cardiac events. This study evaluates the impact of the depression intervention on health behavior and blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: Between 2005 and 2008, 157 patients who remained persistently depressed 3 months after ACS were randomized to a 6-month depression intervention (initial patient preference for problem-solving therapy and/or pharmacotherapy, followed by stepped care; 80 patients) or to usual care (77 patients). At randomization, and then 2, 4, and 6 months later, patients were asked if they (1) missed taking their aspirin; (2) followed a heart healthy diet; (3) exercised regularly; and (4) used tobacco products. Blood pressure was measured before randomization and 6 months later.
AB  - RESULTS: At the end of the intervention, there was no significant improvement in the percentage of intervention compared to control group patients who adhered to aspirin (+3% versus -1%, P = .23), followed a healthy diet (+10% versus +8%, P = .39), exercised regularly (+5% versus +4%, P = .65), abstained from tobacco (-3% versus -1%, P = .77), or had controlled blood pressure (+6% versus +16%, P = .26).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite improving depression, enhanced depression care after an ACS did not improve health behavior or blood pressure control compared to usual care. Research is needed to test whether adding an adherence intervention to enhanced depression care can improve adherence and cardiovascular prognosis in depressed patients post-ACS.Copyright © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

TI  - Outcomes of a home telehealth intervention for patients with diabetes and hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Home telehealth programs often focus on a single disease, yet many patients who need monitoring have multiple conditions. This study evaluated secondary outcomes from a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of home telehealth to improve outcomes of patients with co-morbid diabetes and hypertension.
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A single-center randomized controlled clinical trial compared two remote monitoring intensity levels (low and high) and usual care in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension being treated in primary care. Secondary outcomes assessed were knowledge (diabetes, hypertension, medications), self-efficacy, adherence (diabetes, medications), and patient perceptions of the intervention mode.
AB  - RESULTS: Knowledge scores improved in the high-intensity intervention group participants, but upon further analysis, we found the intervention effect was not mediated by gain in knowledge. No significant differences were found across the groups in self-efficacy, adherence, or patient perceptions of the intervention mode.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Home telehealth can enhance detection of key clinical symptoms that occur between regular physician visits. While our intervention improved glycemic and blood pressure control, the mechanism of the effect for this improvement was not clear.

TI  - Implementation of shared decision making by physician training to optimise hypertension treatment. Study protocol of a cluster-RCT.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is one of the key factors causing cardiovascular diseases which make up the most frequent cause of death in industrialised nations. However about 60% of hypertensive patients in Germany treated with antihypertensives do not reach the recommended target blood pressure. The involvement of patients in medical decision making fulfils not only an ethical imperative but, furthermore, has the potential of higher treatment success. One concept to enhance the active role of patients is shared decision making. Until now there exists little information on the effects of shared decision making trainings for general practitioners on patient participation and on lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: In a cluster-randomised controlled trial 1800 patients receiving antihypertensives will be screened with 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in their general practitioners' practices. Only patients who have not reached their blood pressure target (approximately 1200) will remain in the study (T1 - T3). General practitioners of the intervention group will take part in a shared decision making-training after baseline assessment (T0). General practitioners of the control group will treat their patients as usual. Primary endpoints are change of systolic blood pressure and change of patients' perceived participation. Secondary endpoints are changes of diastolic blood pressure, knowledge, medical adherence and cardiovascular risk. Data analysis will be performed with mixed effects models.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The hypothesis underlying this study is that shared decision making, realised by a shared decision making training for general practitioners, activates patients, facilitates patients' empowerment and contributes to a better hypertension control. This study is the first one that tests this hypothesis with a (cluster-) randomised trial and a large sample size.

TI  - Adherence to blood pressure telemonitoring in a cluster-randomized clinical trial.
AB  - Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and death worldwide. Advances in technology have added telemedicine as a tool for managing hypertension. The effectiveness of telemedicine depends on patients' ability to adhere to schedules of home monitoring and case management. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension in the intervention arm of a randomized trial who completed 6 months of follow-up were included in this analysis. They were asked to measure their blood pressure (BP) a minimum of 6 times per week using a telemonitor that transmitted the readings to their pharmacist case manager. Hypertensive patients in this study had high adherence to telemonitoring (73% took at least 6 BP readings per week) and phone visits (88% of expected visits were attended). In a multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, and some college education predicted better telemonitoring adherence. White non-Hispanic race/ethnicity predicted better adherence to phone visits with pharmacist case managers. Telemonitoring adherence and phone adherence were highly correlated; participants who did not send readings on schedule were more likely to skip at least one phone visit with their pharmacist case manager. The findings from this analysis indicate that hypertensive patients in this study were able to achieve and maintain high adherence to both the telemonitoring and the phone case management visits.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Patient trust in physicians and adoption of lifestyle behaviors to control high blood pressure.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between patients' trust in their physician and self-reported adoption of lifestyle modification behaviors and medication adherence for control of hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of interventions to enhance hypertensive patients' adherence to medications and recommended lifestyle modifications. Two hundred patients were seen by 41 physicians at 14 urban primary care practices in Baltimore, Maryland, and followed for 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Seventy percent of patients reported complete trust in their physician. In adjusted analyses, patients with complete trust had higher odds of reporting that they were trying to lose weight (OR=2.27, 95% CI=1.38-3.74) than did patients with less than complete trust in their physician. Though not statistically significant, the odds of reporting trying to cut back on salt and engaging in regular exercise were greater in patients with complete trust. We observed no association for reports of medication adherence.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Trust in one's physician predicts attempts to lose weight among patients with hypertension, and may contribute to attempts to reduce salt and increase exercise.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Strengthening patient-physician relationships through efforts to enhance trust may be a promising strategy to enhance patients' engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors for hypertension.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A real-life study of the use, effectiveness and tolerability of rosiglitazone in France: the AVANCE study.
AB  - AIM: The study aimed to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of rosiglitazone, and its profile in terms of treatment adherence, treated patients and prescribing recommendations under everyday conditions of care.
AB  - METHODS: This was a "real-life" observational longitudinal study including patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) starting treatment with rosiglitazone and followed for up to 2 years. A questionnaire was completed at the time of inclusion and during routine consultations at around 6, 12, 18 and 24 months following inclusion. Information was collected on sociodemographics, clinical history, treatments, co-morbidities, laboratory data and compliance with treatment. There were three primary outcome measures: treatment response (defined as an HbA1c < 8.0% or a decrease in HbA1c > 0.7%); switch to insulin (as considered necessary by the physician); and occurrence of adverse events requiring a change or discontinuation of treatment.
AB  - RESULTS: The evaluation included 670 patients (61.1%) treated with rosiglitazone/metformin as fixed-dose combination tablets and 427 (38.9%) with standard rosiglitazone tablets. Rates of HbA1c response, defined as an HbA1c less than or equal to 8.0% or a decrease in HbA1c greater than or equal to 0.7%, ranged from 80.6% to 92.1% depending on the follow-up time. The percentage of patients with an HbA1c less than 7% was 18.4% before rosiglitazone was prescribed, and ranged from 48.2% to 57.8% depending on the follow-up period. Sixty-two patients (6.1%, 95% CI: 4.6-7.6%) switched to insulin therapy during the follow-up period. Spontaneously reported adverse events leading to a change or discontinuation of treatment were seen in 45 patients (4.4%, 95% CI: 3.2-5.6%).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Rosiglitazone showed sustained efficacy, with around 90% of patients defined as responders to the treatment in terms of reduction in HbA1c, and was relatively well tolerated. The adverse-event profile was consistent with the known effects of rosiglitazone, and no signs of increased cardiovascular ischaemic risk were observed. These results are in agreement with previous studies on rosiglitazone.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Blood pressure and lipid management fall far short in persons with type 2 diabetes: results from the DIAB-CORE Consortium including six German population-based studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although most deaths among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are attributable to cardiovascular disease, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors appear to be inadequately treated in medical practice. The aim of this study was to describe hypertension, dyslipidemia and medical treatment of these conditions in a large population-based sample.
AB  - METHODS: The present analysis was based on the DIAB-CORE project, in which data from five regional population-based studies and one nationwide German study were pooled. All studies were conducted between 1997 and 2006. We assessed the frequencies of risk factors and co-morbidities, especially hypertension and dyslipidemia, in participants with and without T2D. The odds of no or insufficient treatment and the odds of pharmacotherapy were computed using multivariable logistic regression models. Types of medication regimens were described.
AB  - RESULTS: The pooled data set comprised individual data of 15, 071 participants aged 45-74years, including 1287 (8.5%) participants with T2D. Subjects with T2D were significantly more likely to have untreated or insufficiently treated hypertension, i.e. blood pressure of>= 140/90mmHg (OR=1.43, 95% CI 1.26-1.61) and dyslipidemia i.e. a total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio>= 5 (OR=1.80, 95% CI 1.59-2.04) than participants without T2D. Untreated or insufficiently treated blood pressure was observed in 48.9% of participants without T2D and in 63.6% of participants with T2D. In this latter group, 28.0% did not receive anti-hypertensive medication and 72.0% were insufficiently treated. In non-T2D participants, 28.8% had untreated or insufficiently treated dyslipidemia. Of all participants with T2D 42.5% had currently elevated lipids, 80.3% of these were untreated and 19.7% were insufficiently treated.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure and lipid management fall short especially in persons with T2D across Germany. The importance of sufficient risk factor control besides blood glucose monitoring in diabetes care needs to be emphasized in order to prevent cardiovascular sequelae and premature death.

TI  - Consultation training of nurses for cardiovascular prevention - a randomized study of 2 years duration.
AB  - The aim of this study was to increase patients' adherence to the treatment of hypertension through the consultation training of nurses. Thirty-three nurses were included in the study. In the intervention group (IG), 19 nurses took part in a 3-day residential training course on the Stages of Change model, Motivational Interviewing and guidelines for cardiovascular prevention, and recruited 153 patients. Sixteen nurses in the control group (CG) recruited 59 patients. A decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and total cholesterol was noticed in both groups over the 2 years. Heart rate (p =0.027), body mass index (p =0.019), weight (p =0.0001), waist (p =0.041), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p =0.0001), the waist-hip ratio (p =0.024), and perceived stress (p =0.001) decreased to any great extent only in the IG. After 2 years, 52.6% of the patients in the IG (p =0.13) reached the target of <140/90 mmHg in blood pressure compared with 39.2% in the CG. For self-reported physical activity, there was a significant (p =0.021) difference between the groups. The beneficial effects of the consultation training on patients' weight parameters, physical activity, perceived stress and the proportion of patients who achieved blood pressure control emphasize consultation training and the use of behavioural models in motivating patients to adhere to treatment.

TI  - A multifactorial intervention to improve blood pressure control in co-existing diabetes and kidney disease: a feasibility randomized controlled trial.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility and impact of an intervention consisting of self-monitored blood pressure, medicine review, a Digital Versatile Disc, and motivational interviewing telephone calls to help people with diabetes and kidney disease improve their blood pressure control and adherence to prescribed medications.
AB  - BACKGROUND: People with co-existing diabetes, kidney disease and hypertension require multiple medications to manage their health. About 50% of people are non-adherent to their prescribed medications with non-adherence increasing in the presence of chronic conditions.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
AB  - METHODS: Patients aged >18 years with diabetes, chronic kidney disease and systolic hypertension were recruited from nephrology and diabetes outpatients' clinics of an Australian metropolitan hospital between 2008-2009. Participants were randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to one of two groups in a randomized controlled trial: the intervention delivered over 3 months (n = 39) and usual care (n = 41), with follow-up at 3, 6 and 9 months postintervention. People collecting data and assessing outcomes were blinded to group assignment.
AB  - RESULTS:   Seventy-five participants completed the study. The intervention was acceptable and feasible for this cohort. There were no statistically significant differences between groups, although the mean systolic blood pressure reduction in the intervention group (n = 36) was -6.9 mmHg 95% CI (-13.8, -0.02) at 9 months postintervention.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The study was feasible and statistically significant differences may be determinable in a larger sample to overcome the variability between groups, paying attention to recommendations for further research.
AB  - TRIAL REGISTRATION:   The trial was prospectively registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ACTRN12607000044426).Copyright © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of clinical pharmacy management of patients with type 2 diabetes in an outpatient diabetes clinic in Jordan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycemic goals (hemoglobin A1c < 7%) are often not achieved in patients with type 2 diabetes despite the availability of many effective treatments and the documented benefits of glycemic control in the reduction of long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications. Several studies have established the important positive effects of pharmacist-led management on achieving glycemic control and other clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes. Diabetes prevalence and mortality are increasing rapidly in Jordan. Nevertheless, clinical pharmacists in Jordan do not typically provide pharmaceutical care; instead, the principal responsibilities of pharmacists in Jordan are dispensing and marketing of medical products to physicians.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the primary clinical outcome of glycemic control (A1c) and secondary outcomes, including blood pressure, lipid values, self-reported medication adherence, and self-care activities for patients with type 2 diabetes in an outpatient diabetes clinic randomly assigned to either usual care or a pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care intervention program.
AB  - METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes attending an outpatient diabetes clinic of a large teaching hospital were recruited over a 4-month period from January through April 2011 and randomly assigned to intervention and usual care groups using the Minim software technique. The intervention group at baseline received face-to-face objective-directed education from a clinical pharmacist about type 2 diabetes, prescription medications, and necessary lifestyle changes, followed by 8 weekly telephone follow-up calls to discuss and review the prescribed treatment plan and to resolve any patient concerns. The primary outcome measure was glycemic control (A1c), and secondary measures included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, complete lipid profile (i.e., total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], serum triglycerides), and self-reported medication adherence (4-item Morisky Scale) and self-care activities (Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities questionnaire). Data were collected at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. Changes from baseline to follow-up were calculated for biomarker values, and between-group differences in the change amounts were tested using the t test for independent samples. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 77 of 85 patients (90.6%) randomly assigned to the intervention group and 79 of 86 patients (91.9%) assigned to usual care had baseline and 6-month follow-up values. Compared with baseline values, patients in the intervention group had a mean reduction of 0.8% in A1c versus a mean increase of 0.1% from baseline in the usual care group (P = 0.019). The intervention group compared with the usual care group had small but statistically significant improvements in the secondary measures of fasting blood glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL-C, serum triglycerides, self-reported medication adherence, and self-care activities. Between-group differences in changes in the secondary measures of HDL-C and body mass index were not significant.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 diabetes who received pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care in an outpatient diabetes clinic experienced reduction in A1c at 6 months compared with essentially no change in the usual care group. Six of 8 secondary biomarkers were improved in the intervention group compared with usual care.Copyright © 2012, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy. All rights reserved.

TI  - 'Diagnostic mode' improves adherence to the home blood pressure measurement schedule.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accuracy of home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) depends on adherence to the measurement schedule. We investigated the number of deviations from the requested schedule using an HBPM device equipped with a diagnostic mode that only allows patients to take a fixed number of BP readings at preset times.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized patients to measure their BP as recommended by the European Society of Hypertension guideline in either the usual mode or the diagnostic mode.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 135 patients were included, mean age 54.4 +/- 13.6 years, 57 (42.2%) men, with a mean systolic BP of 147.0 +/- 18.4 mmHg and a mean diastolic BP of 88.0 +/- 10.3 mmHg. In 66 patients, BP was measured in the diagnostic mode, whereas in 69 patients BP was measured in the usual mode. In the diagnostic mode, 40% of patients showed full adherence to the measurement schedule, compared with 23% of patients in the usual mode (P = 0.02). Unscheduled measurements were performed by 55% of patients measuring BP in the usual mode and none in the diagnostic mode. The number of patients who omitted readings was similar in the diagnostic and the usual mode (P = 0.9). Compared with scheduled readings only, 12% of patients measuring BP in the usual mode fell into a different BP category, whereas reclassification did not occur in patients using the diagnostic mode (P = 0.03).
AB  - CONCLUSION: HBPM in the diagnostic mode almost doubled the number of patients with full adherence to the measurement schedule and eliminated the number of patients who were reclassified in a different BP category.

TI  - Catheter-based renal denervation for resistant hypertension: rationale and design of the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 Trial.
AB  - Hypertension represents a significant global public health concern, contributing to vascular and renal morbidity, cardiovascular mortality, and economic burden. The opportunity to influence clinical outcomes through hypertension management is therefore paramount. Despite adherence to multiple available medical therapies, a significant proportion of patients have persistent blood pressure elevation, a condition termed resistant hypertension. Recent recognition of the importance of the renal sympathetic and somatic nerves in modulating blood pressure and the development of a novel procedure that selectively removes these contributors to resistant hypertension represents an opportunity to provide clinically meaningful benefit across wide and varied patient populations. Early clinical evaluation with catheter-based, selective renal sympathetic denervation in patients with resistant hypertension has mechanistically correlated sympathetic efferent denervation with decreased renal norepinephrine spillover and renin activity, increased renal plasma flow, and has demonstrated clinically significant, sustained reductions in blood pressure. The SYMPLICITY HTN-3 Trial is a pivotal study designed as a prospective, randomized, masked procedure, single-blind trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of catheter-based bilateral renal denervation for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension despite compliance with at least 3 antihypertensive medications of different classes (at least one of which is a diuretic) at maximal tolerable doses. The primary effectiveness endpoint is measured as the change in office-based systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months. This manuscript describes the design and methodology of a regulatory trial of selective renal denervation for the treatment of hypertension among patients who have failed pharmacologic therapy.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Compliance with cardiovascular drug prevention measures in a general population: the Multidisciplinary Intervention in Primary Care (IMAP) study.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate adherence to guideline-recommended drug therapies for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention in a general Mediterranean population.
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a random sample of 2270 individuals (18-80 years) assigned to a health centre in Malaga (Spain). The appropriate use was analysed of statins, antithrombotics, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB), based on the criteria of the European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Prevention and the European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology.
AB  - RESULTS: The prescription rate of statins, antithrombotics, beta-blockers, and ACEI/ARB was 7.8%, 5.1%, 3.3%, and 11%, respectively. The prescription of these drugs was inappropriate in 36.2%, 22.4%, 64.5%, and 0%, respectively. Overtreatment was more frequent in subjects with greater comorbidity or > 2 vascular risk factors (p < 0.001). The percentage of individuals with prescription criteria but who did not receive the treatment was 19.5%, 4.7%, 2%, and 9.3%, respectively, increasing significantly with age, Charlson index, and the presence of > 2 risk factors (p < 0.001). Only 11% of patients in secondary prevention received combination therapy with statins, antithrombotics, and ACEI/ARB. Patients with ischaemic heart disease, as compared to non-coronary vascular patients, more frequently received statins (56.1% vs. 25.6%; p = 0.0001) and antithrombotic drugs (66.7% vs. 56.4%; p = 0.02).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We detected a low adherence to existing pharmacological guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. A priority is to establish appropriate training and dissemination of cardiovascular prevention guidelines in the field of primary care.

TI  - Treatment adherence and blood pressure control in older individuals with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to treatment has been identified as the main cause of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP), and may represent a greater risk in older individuals.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the rate of adherence to hypertension treatment using different methods, to estimate the BP control rate, and to observe if there is an association between BP control and adherence.
AB  - METHODS: Treatment adherence was evaluated in older patients with hypertension, followed by the public primary health care, through four methods, including the Morisky-Green test (reference), the Attitude regarding the Medication Intake questionnaire (AMI), an evaluation of adherence by the nurse in the office (Nurse Adherence Evaluation - NAE), and at home (Home Adherence Evaluation - HAE). Salt intake was estimated by 24-hour sodium urinary excretion. BP control was assessed by the awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
AB  - RESULTS: Concordance between the Morisky-Green test and AMI (Kappa=0.27) or NAE (Kappa=0.05) was poor. There was a moderate concordance between the Morisky-Green test and HAE. Eighty percent had controlled BP, including 42% with white-coat effect. The group with lower salt excretion informed to avoid salt intake more times (p<0.001) and had better medication adherence (p<0.001) than the higher salt excretion group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The evaluated tests did not show a good concordance to the Morisky-Green test. Adherence to hypertension treatment was low; however, there was a high rate of BP control when subjects with the white-coat effect were included in the analysis.

TI  - Impact of daily dosing frequency on adherence to chronic medications among nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multiple daily dosing may be negatively associated with patient medication adherence, but the findings are inconclusive. The objective of this study was to compare adherence rates to once-daily (q.d.) versus twice-daily (b.i.d.) dosing regimen of chronic medications in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF).
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors analyzed the PharMetrics Integrated Claims database from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2009. Adult patients with continuous insurance coverage, newly initiated on diabetes or hypertension medication, and having at least one AF diagnosis with no valvular heart disease or valve replacement procedures were included. Compliance to q.d. and b.i.d. therapies was calculated in two ways: medication possession ratio (MPR) and proportion of days covered (PDC). Adherence was defined as an MPR or PDC >0.8. Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to compare the probability of adherence between the q.d. and b.i.d. groups adjusting for baseline confounders.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 8,256 q.d. and 2,441 b.i.d. patients were identified. The mean duration of exposure to therapy for q.d. and b.i.d. patients was 447 and 406 days (P < 0.001), respectively. Based on MPR, 75.3% of q.d. and 70.4% of b.i.d. patients were adherent (P < 0.001). For PDC at 12 months, the proportion of adherent patients for the q.d. and b.i.d. groups was 56.5% and 49.6% (P < 0.001), respectively. Adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) of adherence for the q.d. relative to b.i.d. group were 1.26 (1.13, 1.41) based on MPR and 1.23 (1.07, 1.41) based on PDC at 12 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that nonvalvular AF patients treated with q.d. dosing regimens for chronic medications were associated with approximately a 26% higher likelihood of adherence compared with subjects on b.i.d. regimens.

TI  - Gender impact on prognosis of acute coronary syndrome patients treated with drug-eluting stents.
AB  - Women have a higher risk of adverse outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) than men. However, in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), long-term outcomes after contemporary PCI with drug-eluting stent (DES) have not been fully investigated. We aimed to test the impact of gender on outcomes in patients with ACS after PCI with DES. We analyzed all patients with ACS from the prospective NOBORI-2 trial who underwent PCI with a Nobori DES from 2008 through 2009 in 125 centers worldwide. End points of the study were target lesion failure, cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), and clinically driven target lesion revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events (composite of cardiac death, MI, and target vessel revascularization) at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years. There were 1,640 patients with ACS, 1,268 men (77%) and 372 women (23%). Compared to men, women were 5 years older and more frequently had co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. There were no gender differences for cardiac death (1.3% vs 2.7%), MI (2.1% vs 3.2%), or target lesion revascularization (2.6% vs 3.8%) at 1 year after the procedure for men and women, respectively. The trend was the same at 2 years (cardiac death 2.0% vs 2.3%, MI 2.5% vs 3.5%, target lesion revascularization 3.2% vs 4.6%). Target lesion failure rates were 4.5% and 5.9% at 1 year and 5.7% and 7.3% at 2 years in men and women, respectively (p = NS). Multivariate analysis, which included age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and number of diseased vessels, showed that gender was not a predictor for outcome. There were no differences in bleeding or stent thrombosis rates. Relief from anginal symptoms was similar. The same rate of adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy was observed and reached 73% at 1 year and 31% at 2 years after the ACS event and PCI. In conclusion, although women had worse baseline characteristics, no differences in outcomes were observed between men and women treated for ACS with contemporary DES.Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - An observational, prospective, open-label, multicentre evaluation of aliskiren in treated, uncontrolled patients: a real-life, long-term, follow-up, clinical practice in Italy.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The addition of the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren is demonstrated to improve blood pressure (BP) control rate and reduce progression of organ damage in treated hypertensive patients in clinical trials with a relatively short follow-up period.
AB  - AIM: The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of aliskiren as an add-on antihypertensive therapy in high-risk, treated, hypertensive patients, who were not controlled with concomitant treatment with at least two antihypertensive drugs under 'real-life' conditions, during a planned observation and treatment period of at least 12 months in Italy.
AB  - METHODS: Clinical data were derived from medical databases of treated, uncontrolled, hypertensive patients followed by specialized physicians operating in different clinical settings (hospital divisions or outpatient clinics) in Italy. Aliskiren was added to stable antihypertensive treatment, including at least two drug classes (independently of class or dosage) and unable to achieve BP control. Follow-up visits for measuring clinic BP levels and collecting data on drug safety and tolerability were planned at time intervals of 1, 6 and 12 months. At each predefined follow-up visit, aliskiren could be up-titrated from 150 to 300 mg daily if BP control was not achieved.
AB  - RESULTS: From May 2009 to June 2011, a total of 1186 treated, uncontrolled, hypertensive patients (46.3% female, aged 65.2 +/- 11.7 years, mean duration of hypertension 13.2 +/- 9.3 years, mean clinic BP levels 156.5 +/- 15.9/90.3 +/- 9.5 mmHg) were enrolled. Systolic and diastolic BP levels were 141.1/82.4, 134.9/79.8 and 133.6/78.9 mmHg at 1-, 6- and 12-month follow-up visits, respectively (p < 0.0001 vs baseline for all comparisons). These effects were consistent in all predefined subgroups, including those with left ventricular hypertrophy, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease. Reduced levels of microalbuminuria were also reported, without affecting other renal and electrolyte parameters. Overall, compliance to study medication was high (93.0%), with a very low proportion of patients experiencing adverse events leading to drug discontinuation (3.6%).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this observational, prospective, open-label, multicentre study, we reported the 12-month clinical effectiveness, safety and tolerability of adding aliskiren to treated, uncontrolled, hypertensive patients in a 'real-life' setting in Italy. This strategy leads to a significantly improved BP control rate and low incidence of drug-related side effects or discontinuations.

TI  - Fixed-dose combination therapy in hypertension: pros.
AB  - Effective treatment of high blood pressure represents a key strategy for reducing the burden of hypertension-related cardiovascular diseases, mostly myocardial infarction and stroke. Despite these well established concepts, however, hypertension remains poorly controlled, worldwide. In addition, treated hypertensive patients often remain at higher risk compared with the normotensive population, even when a satisfactory blood pressure control is achieved, due to the high or very high added cardiovascular risk profile observed in these patients. An emerging strategy to improve blood pressure control and achieve this unmet target for cardiovascular disease prevention in hypertensive patients is represented by a more extensive use of rational and effective combination therapies with respect to monotherapy. Such an approach has been recently proposed even as first-line strategy in hypertensive patients at high added cardiovascular risk or in those in whom strict blood pressure control is required. Within the possible antihypertensive drug combinations currently available for the clinical management of hypertension, those based on the association of drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system and thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers have demonstrated to be effective and safe in lowering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels with a good tolerability profile. In addition, these strategies have provided evidence for effective cardiovascular protection compared with conventional antihypertensive therapies. Among the antihypertensive drugs able to counteract the deleterious effects of abnormal activation of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II receptor blockers have demonstrated to provide better tolerability profile and greater cardiovascular protection on hypertension-related organ damage compared with ACE inhibitors in randomized controlled clinical trials, in the presence of similar antihypertensive efficacy and safety. In particular, these drugs are characterized by lower rates of drug-related side effects, better compliance and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive regimens, and use in synergistic and rational combination therapies, all factors that may contribute to improve blood pressure control and reduce discontinuations from antihypertensive therapy in treated hypertensive patients.

TI  - Fixed-dose combination therapy in hypertension: cons.
AB  - The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to reduce the risk associated with blood pressure elevation. Although the choice of first-line drug therapy may exert some effects on different long-term cardiovascular endpoints, randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses demonstrated that blood pressure reduction per se is the primary determinant in primary and secondary prevention. Numerous analyses carried out over the last years have repeatedly shown that many patients require the combination of two or more drugs to reach the recommended level of blood pressure control. Within this context, combination therapy with separate agents or fixed-dose combination pills offers an attractive ability to lower blood pressure more quickly, decrease adverse effects and reach blood pressure target. It is not clear whether fixed combinations of antihypertensive agents in a single tablet provide a greater benefit than the corresponding components given separately. In other words, it is not clear if the use of fixed combinations translates into a clearly improved blood pressure control and cardiovascular prevention in clinical practice. Fixed-dose combinations may simplify the treatment regimen by reducing the number of pills and may be attractive for many hypertensive patients. However, single-pill (fixed) drug combinations have some disadvantages: (i) branded fixed combinations may be more expensive than equivalent free combinations; (ii) the duration of action of individual components may not be equivalent, and this may not justify a single daily dosing of the combination; and (iii) the use of fixed combinations implies less flexibility in modifying the doses of individual components and the exposure of patients to unnecessary therapy. Moreover, should a patient develop side effects to one component, the entire combination should be discontinued and replaced by free drugs. The following three types of fixed-dose tablets have been recently proposed to give additional flexibility: (i) tablet manufactured so that each of the two drugs is placed at opposite ends of the tablet with a drug-free (inactive) layer placed in between; (ii) tablet with the combination of drugs at each end with the inactive zone in between; and (iii) tablet divided into discrete, separate segments (the two drugs are combined uniformly), which provides benefits for initial close titration and dosage adjustments. Currently, none of the fixed-dose tablets available on the market have these characteristics and, consequently, are unable to be broken to allow sufficient flexibility.

TI  - Improving blood pressure control in end stage renal disease through a supportive educative nursing intervention.
AB  - Hypertension in patients on hemodialysis (HD) contributes significantly to their morbidity and mortality. This study examined whether a supportive nursing intervention incorporating monitoring, goal setting, and reinforcement can improve blood pressure (BP) control in a chronic HD population. A randomized controlled design was used and 118 participants were recruited from six HD units in the Detroit metro area. The intervention consisted of (1) BP education sessions; (2) a 12-week intervention, including monitoring, goal setting, and reinforcement; and (3) a 30-day post-intervention follow-up period. Participants in the treatment were asked to monitor their BP, sodium, and fluid intake weekly for 12 weeks in weekly logs. BP, fluid and sodium logs were reviewed weekly with the researcher to determine if goals were met or not met. Reinforcement was given for goals met and problem solving offered when goals were not met. The control group received standard care. Both systolic and diastolic BPs were significantly decreased in the treatment group.

TI  - 'Decision support system (DSS) for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among hypertensive (HTN) patients in Andhra Pradesh, India'--a cluster randomised community intervention trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Very few studies having decision support systems as an intervention report on patient outcomes for cardiovascular disease in the Western world. The potential role of decision support system for the management of blood pressure among Indian hypertensives remains unclear. We propose a cluster randomised trial that aims to test the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of DSS among Indian hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: The trial design is a cluster randomised community intervention trial, in which the participants would be adult male and female hypertensive patients, in the age group of 35 to 64 years, reporting to the Primary Health Care centres of Mahabubnagar district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The objective of the study is to test the effectiveness and compare the cost effectiveness and cost utility among hypertensive subjects randomized to receive either decision support system or a chart based algorithmic support system in urban and rural areas of a district in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India (baseline versus 12 months follow up). The primary outcome would be a comparison of the systolic blood pressure at 0 and 12 months among hypertensive patients randomized to receive the decision support system or the chart based algorithmic support system. Computer generated randomisation and an investigator and analyser blinded method would be followed. 1600 participants; 800 to each arm; each arm having eight clusters of hundred participants each have been recruited between 01 August 2011 - 01 March 2012. A twelve month follow up will be completed by March 2013 and results are expected by April 2013.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This cluster randomized community intervention trial on DSS will enable policy makers to find out the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and cost utility of decision support system for management of blood pressure among hypertensive patients in India. Most of the previous studies on decision support system have focused on physician performance, adherence and on preventive care reminders. The uniqueness of the proposed study lies in finding out the effectiveness of a decision support system on patient related outcomes.

TI  - A moderate-sodium DASH-type diet improves mood in postmenopausal women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the effect on mood of a moderate sodium Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-type diet, which included lean red meat (vitality diet [VD]), with a healthy diet (HD; decreased fat and increased wholegrain breads and cereal).
AB  - METHODS: In a randomized, parallel intervention study, postmenopausal women were assigned to the VD or HD for 14 wk. Mood was measured every 2 wk by the Profile of Mood States. Dietary adherence was assessed using 24-h urine collections. Data were analyzed using one-way between-groups multivariate analysis of variance and correlations.
AB  - RESULTS: Forty-six subjects completed the VD and 49 completed the HD. The two groups showed an improvement in anger, confusion, depression, fatigue, tension, vigor, and the Profile of Mood States global score over the length of the intervention (P < 0.01 for time), but there was a significant diet group by time effect for anger (P < 0.05), such that anger improved more in the VD compared with the HD group. For the two groups combined, urinary sodium excretion was associated with the Profile of Mood States global score, such that a low sodium intake was associated with a better mood (r = 0.267, P < 0.05). In addition, red meat consumption (a component of the VD) was associated with a decrease in depression (r = -0.21, P < 0.05) and an increase in fruit consumption was associated with a decrease in confusion (r = -0.26, P < 0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: In addition to the health benefits of a moderate-sodium Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet on blood pressure and bone health, this diet had a positive effect on improving mood in postmenopausal women.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: TODAY (Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) is a federally funded multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing three treatments of youth onset type 2 diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of youth participating in a 2-6 month run-in period in preparation for randomization into TODAY.
AB  - SUBJECTS: An ethnically diverse sample of 927 youth, 65.4% females, aged 13.7 +/- 2.0 yr old, with type 2 diabetes for a median of 2 months (0.7-7.8 months, 25th-75th percentiles).
AB  - METHODS: A run-in period was conducted to achieve HbA1c <8% with metformin monotherapy and diabetes education, and to evaluate adherence to pill taking, visit attendance, and other procedures.
AB  - RESULTS: At entry, mean body mass index (BMI) and z-BMI were 35.6 +/- 7.7 and 2.3 +/- 0.4, respectively, mean HbA1c was 7.7 +/- 2.2%, only 42.5% were on a hypoglycemic treatment, and 35.6% had HbA1c >8%. Comorbid conditions were common; 18.8% had hypertension, 24.2% had elevated cholesterol, and 6.5% had abnormal liver enzymes. After a median 71 d of run-in, 90.9% had HbA1c <8%, 77.9% had HbA1c <7%, and 46.4% had HbA1c <6%. Of the 772 youth achieving the target HbA1c <8%, 704 (91.2%) were randomized; non-adherence to metformin treatment was the main cause for non-randomization. Youth proceeding to randomization decreased weight by 0.68kg and HbA1c by 1.45% compared to a weight gain of 0.71kg and HbA1c decrease of 0.74% in the non-randomized youth (p = 0.01 in both cases). However, change in z-BMI was not significantly different between the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Most youth with recent onset type 2 diabetes can achieve target HbA1c <8.0% with short-term metformin monotherapy and standard diabetes education (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00081328).Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TI  - Pharmaceutical care program for elderly patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a pilot pharmaceutical care program developed for elderly patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Nonrandomized single intervention pre/posttest blood pressure study in a community pharmacy in Aracaju, Brazil. This study enrolled elderly patients diagnosed with essential hypertension and uncontrolled blood pressure. Monthly visits were scheduled during a 10-month period. Pharmaceutical interventions were focused on health education and monitoring of drug-related problems. Primary outcomes included target blood pressure control, reduction in blood pressure, pulse pressure, medication adherence, and reduction of anthropometric indices.
AB  - RESULTS: 35 of 51 patients completed the study. After 10 months of intervention, 57.2% of elderly patients achieved blood pressure control (P = 0.000) and the mean reduction was 26.6 mm Hg (P < 0.0001) for systolic blood pressure, 10.4 mm Hg (P < 0.0001) for diastolic blood pressure, and 15.7 mm Hg (P < 0.0001) for pulse pressure. Medication adherence also improved (P = 0.0000); however, anthropometric indices remained unchanged.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The pharmaceutical care program improved outcomes by reducing and controlling blood pressure and improving medication adherence among elderly patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - Adding a low-dose antihypertensive regimen would substantially improve the control of hypertension and reduce cardiovascular morbidity among uncomplicated hypertensive patients.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the utilization of antihypertensive drugs among uncomplicated hypertensive patients in Finland between 2000 and 2006 and to calculate the achievable reduction in cardiovascular morbidity, with intensified antihypertensive treatment.
AB  - METHODS: From the databases of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland, 428,986 treated hypertensives without diabetes or cardiac disease (further named uncomplicated hypertensives) in 2000 and 591,206 in 2006, respectively, were identified. In addition, from the Health 2000 survey representing the whole Finnish adult population, 729 uncomplicated hypertensives were determined to assess their characteristics and control of hypertension. Applying Law's meta-analyses we calculated the reduction of blood pressure (BP) by intensifying the treatment with low-dose antihypertensive regimens for those with a BP >140/90mmHg.
AB  - RESULTS: The nationwide data suggests a relative overuse of beta-blockers. Combination antihypertensive treatment increased relatively 8%, while at least three drug combinations increased from 19.8% to 21.6% between 2000 and 2006. However, calculated prevalence of controlled BP (<140/90mmHg) increased only from 30.3% to 33.9%. Addition of one half standard dose or one to two half standard doses for the treatment of the patients with a BP >140/90mmHg would improve the control of hypertension from 33.9% to 47.8% and 67.3%, respectively. The intensified treatment would reduce strokes by 18% and 28%, and ischaemic heart disease events by 13% and 21%, respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Underutilization of preferred drugs and poor control of BP continues. Surprisingly small addition of the number of low-dose antihypertensive regimen is needed in order to substantially improve the control of hypertension and to decrease cardiovascular morbidity among uncomplicated hypertensive patients.

TI  - Using the general practice EMR for improving blood pressure medication adherence.
AB  - PURPOSE: Analysis of practice electronic medical records (EMRs) demonstrated widespread antihypertensive medication adherence problems in a Pacific-led general practice serving a predominantly Pacific (majority Samoan) caseload in suburban New Zealand. Adherence was quantified in terms of medication possession ratio (MPR, percent of days covered by medication supply) from the practice's prescribing data. We studied the effectiveness of general practice staff follow-up guided by EMR data to improve medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: A framework for identification of suboptimal long-term condition management from routinely-collected EMR data, the ChronoMedIt (Chronological Medical Audit) tool, was applied to data of two Pacific-led general practices to identify patients with low MPR. One practice undertook intervention, the other provided usual care. A cohort was based on MPR<80% for antihypertensive medication in a baseline 6-month period. At the intervention practice a team was established to provide reminders and motivation for these patients and discuss their specific needs for assistance to improve adherence for 12 months. MPR and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was collected at baseline and for last six months of intervention based on practice EMRs; national claims data provided assessment of MPR based on dispensing. Nursing notes were analysed, and patient and provider focus groups were conducted.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 252 intervention patients with MPR<80% initially, MPR improved 12.0% (p=0.0002) and systolic blood pressure was 3.5mmHg lower (p=0.07) as compared to the control cohort. MPR from national claims data improved by 11.5% (p=0.0001) as compared to the control. Patients welcomed the approach as caring and useful. Providers felt the approach worthy of wider deployment but that it required dedicated staffing.
AB  - DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Systematic follow-up of patients with demonstrated poor medication possession appears effective in the context of a Pacific-led general practice serving a largely Pacific caseload. It was possible to exploit the EMR database to identify patients with low antihypertensive medication possession and to raise their level of medication possession significantly. The measured effect on systolic BP was only marginally significant, leaving open the question of the precise value of the intervention in terms of morbidity and mortality. The intervention was found to be feasible and was met with good acceptance from the intervention patients, who appreciated the concern reflected in the follow-up effort. The intervention practice is continuing use of ChronoMedIt to guide long-term condition management with extension to cholesterol and blood sugar.

TI  - Relationship of blood pressure self-monitoring, medication adherence, self-efficacy, stage of change, and blood pressure control among municipal workers with hypertension.
AB  - Uncontrolled blood pressure remains a major public health issue. Medication adherence is a key factor in blood pressure management; however, adherence behavior is not clearly understood and the most significant factors contributing to poor medication adherence and blood pressure control are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of self-monitoring of blood pressure, medication adherence, self-efficacy, stage of change, and blood pressure control among municipal workers with access to health insurance. Stage of change was a significant independent predictor of self-monitoring of blood pressure, but not blood pressure control. A strong relationship was found between medication adherence and medication adherence self-efficacy (r = .549, p < .05).Copyright 2012, SLACK Incorporated.

TI  - Losartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination vs. high-dose losartan in patients with morning hypertension--a prospective, randomized, open-labeled, parallel-group, multicenter trial.
AB  - The treatment of morning hypertension has not been established. We compared the efficacy and safety of a losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination and high-dose losartan in patients with morning hypertension. A prospective, randomized, open-labeled, parallel-group, multicenter trial enrolled 216 treated outpatients with morning hypertension evaluated by home blood pressure (BP) self-measurement. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a combination therapy of 50mg losartan and 12.5mg HCTZ (n=109) or a high-dose therapy with 100mg losartan (n=107), each of which were administered once every morning. Primary efficacy end points were morning systolic BP (SBP) level and target BP achievement rate after 3 months of treatment. At baseline, BP levels were similar between the two therapy groups. Morning SBP was reduced from 150.3+/-10.1 to 131.5+/-11.5mmHg by combination therapy (P<0.001) and from 151.0+/-9.3 to 142.5+/-13.6mmHg by high-dose therapy (P<0.001). The morning SBP reduction was greater in the combination therapy group than in the high-dose therapy group (P<0.001). Combination therapy decreased evening SBP from 141.6+/-13.3 to 125.3+/-13.1mmHg (P<0.001), and high-dose therapy decreased evening SBP from 138.9+/-9.9 to 131.4+/-13.2mmHg (P<0.01). Although both therapies improved target BP achievement rates in the morning and evening (P<0.001 for both), combination therapy increased the achievement rates more than high-dose therapy (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). In clinic measurements, combination therapy was superior to high-dose therapy in reducing SBP and improving the achievement rate (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively). Combination therapy decreased urine albumin excretion (P<0.05) whereas high-dose therapy reduced serum uric acid. Both therapies indicated strong adherence and few adverse effects (P<0.001). In conclusion, losartan/HCTZ combination therapy was more effective for controlling morning hypertension and reducing urine albumin than high-dose losartan.

AB  - DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
AB  - DATA SOURCE: PHARMO database, which contains linked prescription drug information, hospitalization records, and laboratory test results of over 1 million patients in the Netherlands.
AB  - PATIENTS: A total of 7355 new statin users with available cholesterol level measurements before and 12 months after starting statin treatment between 1999 and 2006.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Simvastatin was chosen as the reference drug because policy makers in the Netherlands have promoted the use of generically available statins to reduce costs. Cholesterol level goal attainment rates were compared in patients receiving simvastatin 40 mg/day, which was the statin dose promoted in the 2006 Dutch cardiovascular risk management guidelines, or simvastatin 20 mg/day, which was the most frequently prescribed dose up to 2006, versus other statins at various dose levels. Relative risks (RRs) were adjusted for age, sex, year of therapy initiation, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and adherence during the 3 months before the 12-month follow-up cholesterol measurement. Compared with simvastatin 40 mg/day, cholesterol goal attainment rates were significantly higher with atorvastatin 40 mg/day (RR 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.28) and rosuvastatin 10 mg/day (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.23), were similar with atorvastatin 20 mg/day (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.97-1.16) and rosuvastatin 20 mg/day (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.93-1.39), and were significantly lower with all other frequently used statin dose levels. Compared with simvastatin 20 mg/day, cholesterol goal attainment was significantly higher with any dose of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but were lower with any dose of pravastatin. Goal attainment rates were similar among patients with lower and higher cardiovascular risk. Among the 13-18% of patients who had follow-up cholesterol level measurements at 12 months in all statin groups, the proportion of adherent patients was approximately 75%; this was higher than the proportion of adherent patients in the total population (48-55%), which included patients without follow-up cholesterol levels.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A larger proportion of patients reached cholesterol lipid goals with simvastatin 40 mg/day. Cholesterol level goals were achieved by many patients using the recommended simvastatin 40 mg/day, but by fewer patients among those using the more commonly prescribed simvastatin 20 mg/day. Therefore, especially in high-risk patients, the choice of statin should be based on baseline cholesterol levels and expected reductions in these levels, and treatment should be adapted if targets are not met. Improved cholesterol level monitoring may increase adherence and cholesterol management.Copyright © 2012 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does a combination pill of antihypertensive drugs improve medication adherence in Japanese? A randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to achieve target blood pressure levels to prevent cardiovascular disease, combination therapy of antihypertensive drugs is often required, although it is thought that requiring a patient to take many different pills would reduce adherence to the medication regimen. Whether antihypertensive treatment with a single pill combining antihypertensive drugs would improve medication adherence and blood pressure control was investigated.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 207 hypertensive subjects were randomly assigned to a combination pill group (losartan 50mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg; n=103) or a control group (an angiotensin receptor blocker and a thiazide diuretic; n=104). Medication adherence was evaluated by pill counts at 1, 3, and 6 months after randomization. The mean adherence rates over 6 months were not different between the 2 groups: 98% in the combination pill group and 98% in the control group. Moreover, the 2 groups included similar numbers of subjects with relatively poor adherence rates (<90%) in each treatment period. The mean blood pressures over the 6-month treatment period were not different between the groups: 131/75 mmHg in the combination pill group and 130/75 mmHg in the control group (P=0.84/0.96).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There were no appreciable effects of the combination pill of antihypertensive drugs on medication adherence or blood pressure control in Japanese patients over a 6-month period.

TI  - Predictors of antihypertensive medication adherence in two urban health-care systems.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies on patient-related predictors of adherence used self-reported measures or pharmacy databases to measure adherence. We identified predictors of antihypertensive medication adherence measured by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), the gold standard for adherence assessment, in uncontrolled, predominantly African-American (AA) hypertensives from large urban public and private primary care clinics.
AB  - METHODS: As part of the baseline data collection of a cluster-randomized trial for hypertension control, we measured adherence in a random sample of 124 participants using MEMS caps. We also included the data of 52 patients in intervention clinics who subsequently completed MEMS monitoring on referral from their provider. Participants were classified as adherent if they took > 80% of all prescribed doses. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 176 patients monitored, 61 (34.6%) took <80% of prescribed doses. AA ethnicity (odds ratio (OR) AA vs. Hispanic = 0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.86), female sex (OR = 0.38; 95% CI 0.15-0.91), and public clinics as source of care (OR public clinics vs. private clinics = 0.45; 95% CI 0.20-0.97) were independently associated with lower adherence. Higher adherence was seen in patients monitored by clinician order in the intervention clinics (OR intervention sample vs. random baseline sample = 2.15; 95% CI 0.96-4.81) and diabetic patients (OR = 2.05; 95% CI 1.01-4.15). All analyses were adjusted for education, employment status, and other potentially confounding factors.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: AA ethnicity, female gender and attending a publicly funded primary care clinic were associated with lower adherence. Whether targeting these groups for special interventions would improve overall adherence needs further study.

TI  - Medication adherence changes following value-based insurance design.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether participation in a value-based insurance design (VBID) program was associated with improved medication adherence in 8 drug classes 2 years after implementation and to examine whether adherence changes varied by baseline adherence.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: We used a pre-post quasi-experimental study design with a retrospective cohort of 74,748 enrollees using 8 different therapeutic classes of medications to treat diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or congestive heart failure.
AB  - METHODS: Brand-name medication copayments were lowered (from tier 3 to tier 2) for all enrollees, while generic copayments were waived only for employers who opted into the VBID program. Medication adherence of VBID program participants and nonparticipants 12 months before and 12 and 24 months after program implementation were estimated on 8 propensity-matched cohorts using generalized estimating equations, as well as on subgroups stratified by baseline adherence. Adherence was measured using the medication possession ratio (MPR) from medication refill records.
AB  - RESULTS: VBID was associated with improved medication adherence ranging from 1.4% to 3.2% at 1 year, which increased to 2.1% to 5.2% 2 years following VBID adoption. Adherence changes were most notable among patients who were nonadherent (MPR <.50) before VBID implementation.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Population-based implementation of VBID can improve adherence to medications to treat cardiometabolic conditions, particularly for previously nonadherent patients. VBID guidelines being developed in response to healthcare reform should account for the heterogeneity in patient response to VBID programs.

TI  - Improving blood pressure control through a clinical pharmacist outreach program in patients with diabetes mellitus in 2 high-performing health systems: the adherence and intensification of medications cluster randomized, controlled pragmatic trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even in high-performing health systems, some patients with diabetes mellitus have poor blood pressure (BP) control because of poor medication adherence and lack of medication intensification. We examined whether the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention, a pharmacist-led intervention combining elements found in efficacy studies to lower BP, improved BP among patients with diabetes mellitus with persistent hypertension and poor refill adherence or insufficient medication intensification in 2 high-performing health systems.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective, multisite cluster randomized pragmatic trial with randomization of 16 primary care teams at 5 medical centers (3 Veterans Affairs and 2 Kaiser Permanente) to the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was relative change in systolic BP (SBP), comparing 1797 intervention with 2303 control team patients, from 6 months preceding to 6 months after the 14-month intervention period. We examined shorter-term changes in SBP as a secondary outcome. The mean SBP decrease from 6 months before to 6 months after the intervention period was =9 mm Hg in both arms. Mean SBPs of eligible intervention patients were 2.4 mm Hg lower (95% CI: -3.4 to -1.5; P<0.001) immediately after the intervention than those achieved by control patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Adherence and Intensification of Medications program more rapidly lowered SBPs among intervention patients, but usual-care patients achieved equally low SBP levels by 6 months after the intervention period. These findings show the importance of evaluating in different real-life clinical settings programs found in efficacy trials to be effective before urging their widespread adoption in all settings.

TI  - Effect of the Medicare Part D coverage gap on medication use among patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies of the Medicare Part D coverage gap are limited in generalizability and scope.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the coverage gap on drugs used for asymptomatic (antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs) and symptomatic (pain relievers, acid suppressants, and antidepressants) conditions in elderly patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
AB  - DESIGN: Quasi-experimental study using pre-post design and contemporaneous control group.
AB  - SETTING: Medicare claims files from 2005 and 2006 for 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries.
AB  - PATIENTS: Part D plan enrollees with hypertension or hyperlipidemia aged 65 years or older who had no coverage, generic-only coverage, or both brand-name and generic coverage during the gap in 2006. Patients who were fully eligible for the low-income subsidy served as the control group.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Monthly 30-day supply prescriptions available, medication adherence, and continuous medication gaps of 30 days or more for antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs; monthly 30-day supply prescriptions available for pain relievers, acid suppressants, or antidepressants before and after coverage gap entry.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients with no gap coverage had a decrease in monthly antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drug prescriptions during the coverage gap. Nonadherence also increased in this group (antihypertensives: odds ratio [OR], 1.60 [95% CI, 1.50 to 1.71]; lipid-lowering drugs: OR, 1.59 [CI, 1.50 to 1.68]). The proportion of patients with no gap coverage who had continuous medication gaps in lipid-lowering medication use and antihypertensive use increased by an absolute 7.3% (OR, 1.38 [CI, 1.29 to 1.46]) and 3.2% (OR, 1.35 [CI, 1.25 to 1.45]), respectively, because of the coverage gap. Decreases in use were smaller for pain relievers and antidepressants and larger for acid suppressants in patients with no gap coverage. Patients with generic-only coverage had decreased use of cardiovascular medications but no change in use of drugs for symptomatic conditions. No measures changed in the brand-name and generic coverage groups. Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main findings.
AB  - LIMITATION: Because this study was nonrandomized, unobserved differences may still exist between study groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The Part D coverage gap was associated with decreased use of medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia in patients with no gap coverage and generic-only gap coverage. The proposed phasing out of the gap by 2020 will benefit such patients; however, use of low-value medications may also increase.

TI  - Prevalence of blood pressure self-monitoring, medication adherence, self-efficacy, stage of change, and blood pressure control among municipal workers with hypertension.
AB  - Despite the availability of effective medications, hypertension remains inadequately managed in the United States. It has been established that medication adherence is a major strategy for controlling blood pressure. Combined interventions to promote adherence are promising, but further research is needed to understand which behaviors to target. The frequency of self-monitoring of blood pressure among municipal workers is unknown, and the literature is limited regarding assessing individuals' readiness and confidence to engage in medication adherence. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of medication adherence, readiness, self-efficacy, self-monitoring of blood pressure, and blood pressure control among hypertensive municipal workers. The study population was enrolled in a wellness program established more than 20 years ago to promote health and safety for a work force in a large southeastern U.S. city. The majority of the study participants (75.7%) demonstrated controlled blood pressure, reported adherence to antihypertensive medication (70%), and self-monitored blood pressure (70%).Copyright 2012, SLACK Incorporated.

TI  - The use of rivaroxaban for short- and long-term treatment of venous thromboembolism. [Review]
AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major healthcare concern and affects more than 1.6 million individuals each year worldwide. Long-term complications include recurrent VTE, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and post-thrombotic syndrome. Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor that has advantages over traditional VTE therapies, including minimal drug and food interactions and no requirement for routine coagulation monitoring. It is currently approved for VTE prevention in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery. This review evaluates the potential clinical implications of the multicentre, randomised EINSTEIN studies (EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN EXT), which investigated rivaroxaban for the treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE. In EINSTEIN DVT, rivaroxaban was non-inferior to the standard of care (enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist) for recurrent VTE in patients with acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) without pulmonary embolism (PE). In EINSTEIN EXT, extended-duration rivaroxaban had superior efficacy to placebo in patients with confirmed DVT or PE who had received 6-12 months of prior VTE treatment. Rivaroxaban was associated with an acceptable safety profile in both studies. The net clinical benefit (efficacy and safety endpoints combined) of rivaroxaban was significantly greater than its comparators. The EINSTEIN studies are the first demonstration that a single drug--rivaroxaban--can be effective for both the initial treatment of DVT and prevention of recurrent VTE. Moreover, the simple, once-daily oral administration of rivaroxaban could potentially improve adherence to extended-duration VTE treatment compared with the current standard of care in individuals with confirmed DVT or PE.

TI  - Blood pressure monitoring technique impacts hypertension treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2005 the American Heart Association (AHA) released updated recommendations for blood pressure (BP) monitoring in order to ensure accurate BP measurements.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if current methods of BP assessment in an ambulatory clinic result in significantly different BP measurements than those obtained by following the AHA recommendations and if these BP differences impact treatment decisions.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN: Randomized prospective analysis.
AB  - SETTING: University of New Mexico Hospital Adult Internal Medicine clinic.
AB  - PATIENTS: Forty adults with hypertension
AB  - METHODS: Patient BPs were measured using both the traditional triage method and the AHA-recommended method in cross-over fashion in random order. Two complete medical profile summaries were then constructed for each patient: one for each BP measurement obtained by each technique. These profiles were then reviewed by a panel of providers who provided hypothetical hypertension treatment recommendations.
AB  - RESULTS: Individual BP results varied greatly between the two methods. SBP readings differed by >5 mmHg in either direction for 68% of patients while 78% of patient's DBP readings differed by >2 mmHg in either direction. Overall, 93% of patients had a BP difference of either >5 mmHg systolic or >2 mmHg diastolic. Five patients were determined to be at goal with the triage method, but were higher than their goal BP with the AHA method Significant differences were also seen in treatment recommendations for a given patient based on the differences seen between the two obtained BP readings. The number of patients with treatment variations between their two profiles ranged from 13% to 23% depending on the reviewing provider (p<0.01 for all providers).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Inaccurate BP assessment is common and may impact hypertension treatment decisions.

TI  - Effect on blood pressure of a dietary supplement containing traditional medicinal plants of Cote d'Ivoire.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: A medicinal composition containing salt (sodium chloride) is given as a traditional dietary supplement to hypertensive patients (TDSHP) in Cote d'Ivoire. It consists of whole plant of Bidens pilosa (Asteraceae) and fresh leaves of Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae).
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to establish the scientific basis for the use of this traditional recipe rich in sodium chloride in hypertension settings.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a total aqueous extract of this traditional dietary supplement containing medicinal plants (Bidens pilosa, Moringa oleifera) and salt (sodium chloride). Experiment was carried out to evaluate its effect on arterial blood pressure of rabbits. The experimental device used for recording blood pressure in rabbits is based on the principle of Ludwig mercury manometer.
AB  - RESULTS: TDSHP between 5x10(-8) and 5x10(-2) mg/kg caused a dose-dependent hypotension. TDSHP elicited drops in blood pressure ranging between 7.14+/-4 and 100+/-7.5%, compared to normal blood pressure of rabbits. Fifty percent effective dose of TDSHP was 3.95x10(-4) mg/kg. Similarly as the hypotension induced by acetylcholine, the one caused by TDSHP at dose of 3.95x10(-4) mg/kg in rabbit was progressively inhibited by atropine, dosed between 5x10(-4) to 5x10(-2) mg/kg. The percentage drop of recorded blood pressure ranged from 50.3+/-1.87 to 3.71+/-1.09% compared to the normal value of blood pressure. In the presence of atropine, TDSHP effect was partially inhibited. The same increasing doses of TDSHP reduced significantly the increase of blood pressure induced by adrenaline dosed at 4.76x10(-4) mg/kg from 89.3+/-2.19 to 1.19+/-0.59%.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The consumption of this traditional dietary supplement is justified in hypertensive patients according to its composition and its ability to reduce blood pressure has been demonstrated experimentally. TDSHP should not be considered as an antihypertensive drug, it remains to us a salt substitute to be taken with moderation with strict adherence to the traditional dose.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Do Patients With High Vascular Risk Take Antihypertensive Medication Correctly? Cumple-MEMS Study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To assess compliance with treatment inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) in uncontrolled hypertension in patients at high cardiovascular risk.
AB  - METHODS: Prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study, carried out in 102 Spanish primary care centers. We included 808 uncontrolled hypertensive patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers who were at high vascular risk; 4 visits were conducted: baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months later. Compliance was measured by electronic monitors. We calculated the mean percentage compliance, the overall percentage of compliers, once-daily compliers, compliers with the prescribed time frame, and antihypertensive coverage. We considered a patient to be a complier when the percentage compliance was 80%-100%.
AB  - RESULTS: In all, 701 patients completed the study (mean age, 63.7 [11.1] years). The systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly (P<.0001) to 18.8 mmHg and 9.8 mmHg, respectively. The control rate was 70% (95% confidence interval, 65.6%-74.4%) (P=.0001). The rate of control was significantly higher among compliers than noncompliers (P<.05). The mean percentage of doses taken was 87.9% (95% confidence interval, 84.8%-91%) and the mean therapeutic coverage was 82.4% (95% confidence interval, 78.7%-86.1%). Overall, 73.3% of the patients were compliers (95% confidence interval, 69%-77.6%), 52.8% (95% confidence interval, 48%-57.6%) were once-daily compliers, and 46.5% (95% confidence interval, 41.9%-51.1%) complied with the prescribed time frame. Noncompliance was associated with a higher number of drugs prescribed (P<.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In hypertensive patients at high vascular risk, the rate of therapeutic noncompliance was very high, mainly when they took 5 or more pills daily.Copyright © 2011 Sociedad Espanola de Cardiologia. Published by Elsevier Espana. All rights reserved.

TI  - Perceptions of hypertension treatment among patients with and without diabetes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of a wide selection of effective antihypertensive treatments and the existence of clear treatment guidelines, many patients with hypertension do not have controlled blood pressure. We conducted a qualitative study to explore beliefs and perceptions regarding hypertension and gain an understanding of barriers to treatment among patients with and without diabetes.
AB  - METHODS: Ten focus groups were held for patients with hypertension in three age ranges, with and without diabetes. The topic guides for the groups were: What will determine your future health status? What do you understand by "raised blood pressure"? How should one go about treating raised blood pressure?
AB  - RESULTS: People with hypertension tend to see hypertension not as a disease but as a risk factor for myocardial infarction or stroke. They do not view it as a continuous, degenerative process of damage to the vascular system, but rather as a binary risk process, within which you can either be a winner (not become ill) or a loser. This makes non-adherence to treatment a gamble with a potential positive outcome. Patients with diabetes are more likely to accept hypertension as a chronic illness with minor impact on their routine, and less important than their diabetes. Most participants overestimated the effect of stress as a causative factor believing that a reduction in levels of stress is the most important treatment modality. Many believe they "know their bodies" and are able to control their blood pressure. Patients without diabetes were most likely to adopt a treatment which is a compromise between their physician's suggestions and their own understanding of hypertension.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patient denial and non-adherence to hypertension treatment is a prevalent phenomenon reflecting a conscious choice made by the patient, based on his knowledge and perceptions regarding the medical condition and its treatment. There is a need to change perception of hypertension from a gamble to a disease process. Changing the message from the existing one of "silent killer" to one that depicts hypertension as a manageable disease process may have the potential to significantly increase adherence rates.

TI  - Health coaching to improve hypertension treatment in a low-income, minority population.
AB  - PURPOSE: Poor blood pressure control is common in the United States. We conducted a study to determine whether health coaching with home titration of antihypertensive medications can improve blood pressure control compared with health coaching alone in a low-income, predominantly minority population.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized 237 patients with poorly controlled hypertension at a primary care clinic to receive either home blood pressure monitoring, weekly health coaching, and home titration of blood pressure medications if blood pressures were elevated (n = 129) vs home blood pressure monitoring and health coaching but no home titration (n = 108). The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Both the home-titration arm and the no-home-titration arm had a reduction in systolic blood pressure, with no significant difference between them. When both arms were combined and analyzed as a before-after study, there was a mean decrease in systolic blood pressure of 21.8 mm Hg (P <.001) as well as a decrease in the number of primary care visits from 3.5 in the 6 months before the study to 2.6 during the 6-month study period (P <.001) and 2.4 in the 6 months after the study (P <.001). The more coaching encounters patients had, the greater their reduction in blood pressure.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure control in a low-income, minority population can be improved by teaching patients to monitor their blood pressure at home and having nonprofessional health coaches assist patients, in particular, by counseling them on medication adherence. The improved blood pressure control can be achieved while reducing the time spent by physicians.

TI  - Predictors of lowering SBP to assigned targets at 12 months in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lowering blood pressure for secondary stroke prevention remains a challenge. These analyses were conducted to identify factors predicting achievement of SBP targets in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) study.
AB  - METHODS: SPS3 is a randomized trial assigning patients with lacunar stroke to two targets of SBP control (130-149 mmHg or <130 mmHg). Logistic regression models were used to identify patient and SPS3 site characteristics predictive of lowering SBP to target at the 12-month study visit.
AB  - RESULTS: Of those above target at baseline (n = 1041), 69% were within their assigned target at 12 months. In the model with baseline characteristics only, those receiving treatment for hypertension at baseline were 68% less likely to achieve target [odds ratio (OR) = 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.17-0.60], whereas those of Hispanic ethnicity were 1.49 times more likely (95% CI = 1.09-2.03) to achieve SBP target. When clinical site characteristics were added to the model, only treated hypertension at baseline remained significant. In addition, management at a larger site (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.03-2.20), SBP in target at 6 months (OR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.79-3.19), and medication adherence (OR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.51-4.95) were positively associated with achieving target SBP. Missed appointments (OR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.41-0.73) were negatively associated with lowering SBP to target at 12 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve targets of SBP control in this multiethnic stroke cohort across multiple sites and countries. The results highlight the important variables reflecting clinical site management.

TI  - Persistence and adherence to antihypertensive treatment in relation to initial prescription: diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension is widely considered as a first-line treatment, given the efficacy and low cost of this class of drugs. This indication is not unanimous, because thiazides can cause metabolic alterations, and other side effects that reduce compliance and persistence on treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In a multicentre, open-label randomized study we compared adherence and persistence to therapy of chlortalidone versus other treatments, as a first-line antihypertensive therapy.
AB  - METHODS: Ninety-two general practitioners (GPs) recruited 2409 hypertensive patients with indication to antihypertensive therapy, who were randomized in two arms to start treatment with chlortalidone (12.5-25 mg daily) or any other single medications (excluding thiazides). The patients have been followed for at least 2 years.
AB  - RESULT: Patients receiving diuretic therapy as first-line antihypertensive treatment, modified antihypertensive treatment regimen more often than the others (79.1 versus 43.9%; chi (2)< 0.0001). Patients starting with diuretics received greater number of drugs, compared to patients starting with different antihypertensive therapy (1.55 versus 1.4 antihypertensive drugs; P < 0.0001), but achieved the same blood pressure (BP) control during the follow-up. No differences were observed in persistence and adherence to treatment between the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the recommendation to start antihypertensive therapy with diuretics, when no compelling indications are present, is not supported by the evidence that this strategy produces more rapid and better control of BP.

TI  - The effect of patient-provider communication on medication adherence in hypertensive black patients: does race concordance matter?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence of a positive effect of collaborative patient-provider communication on patient outcomes, our understanding of this relationship is unclear.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to determine whether racial composition of the relationship modified the association between ratings of provider communication and medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: Effect modification of the communication-adherence association, by racial composition of the relationship, was evaluated using general linear mixed models while adjusting for selected covariates.
AB  - RESULTS: Three hundred ninety patients were in race-concordant (black patient, black provider) relationships, while 207 were in race-discordant (black patient, white provider) relationships. The communication-adherence association was significantly modified in race-discordant relationships (p = 0.04). Communication rated as more collaborative in race-discordant relationships was associated with better adherence, while communication rated as less collaborative was associated with poor adherence. There was no significant association between adherence and communication in race-concordant relationships (p = 0.24).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative patient-provider communication may play an influential role in black patients' adherence behaviors when receiving care from white providers.

TI  - Reducing clinical inertia in hypertension treatment: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
AB  - Clinical inertia is a major contributor to poor blood pressure (BP) control. The authors tested the effectiveness of an intervention targeting physician, patient, and office system factors with regard to outcomes of clinical inertia and BP control. A total of 591 adult primary care patients with elevated BP (mean systolic BP > 140 mm Hg or mean diastolic BP > 90 mm Hg) were randomized to intervention or usual care. An outreach coordinator raised patient and provider awareness of unmet BP goals, arranged BP-focused primary care clinic visits, and furnished providers with treatment decision support. The intervention reduced clinical inertia (-29% vs -11%, P=.001). Nonetheless, change in BP did not differ between intervention and usual care (-10.1/-4.1 mm Hg vs -9.1/-4.5 mm Hg, P=.50 and 0.71 for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively). Future primary care-focused interventions might benefit from the use of specific medication titration protocols, treatment adherence support, and more sustained patient follow-up visits.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Biomarkers for cognitive aging part II: oxidative stress, cognitive assessments, and medication adherence.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to further examine potential biomarkers of cognitive aging by looking at the associations among oxidative stress, cognitive abilities, and medication adherence in a community-based sample of middle-aged and older adults (n = 42; mean age = 69 years) prescribed at least one medication for hypertension. In addition to measures described in Part I, "Biomarkers for Cognitive Aging," a 12-hr urine collection for F(2)-isoprostanes served as an indicator of oxidative stress. Participants completed a battery of cognitive assessments and 8 weeks of electronic medication monitoring for adherence to one antihypertensive agent. Oxidative stress was significantly associated with logical memory, immediate (r = -.38, p < .01) and delayed recall (r = -.42, p < .01), and recognition memory (r = -.42, p < .01) from the Wechsler Memory Scale III, number of perseveration errors (r = .26, p < .05) and categories achieved (r = -.26, p < .01) on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WSCT), and medication adherence (r = -.34, p <.05). Findings indicate that a biomarker of oxidative stress, F(2)-isoprostanes corrected for vitamin E, is significantly associated with cognitive measures and a functional outcome.

TI  - A healthy dietary pattern at midlife is associated with subsequent cognitive performance.
AB  - Few studies have investigated the long-term impact of overall dietary patterns (DP) on cognition. We evaluated the association between empirically derived DP in midlife and cognitive performance 13 y later. Dietary data were based on 24-h dietary records obtained from a subsample of the Supplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux Antioxydant Study. Cognitive performance was assessed via a battery of neuropsychological tests that included verbal fluency, the RI-48 cued recall test, the trail-making test, and forward and backward digit span. Three composite variables, for global cognitive function, verbal memory, and executive functioning, were built. The multivariate analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics (age, gender, intervention group, education, alcohol and energy intake, number of dietary records, physical activity, BMI, tobacco use, self-reported memory troubles, diabetes, hypertension, and, for women, menopausal status and hormone therapy use), follow-up time, history of cardiovascular disease, and depressive symptoms. Adjusted means +/- SEM of composite variables across quartiles (Q4 vs. Q1) of DP were estimated using ANCOVA. A healthy and a traditional DP were identified. In the multivariate model, the healthy pattern was associated with better global cognitive function (50.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 48.9 +/- 0.7; P-trend = 0.001) and verbal memory (49.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 48.7 +/- 0.4; P-trend = 0.01). These relationships were stronger in participants scoring below the gender-specific median values for energy intake (<2490 kcal for men and <1810 for women) than in those scoring at or above those values. Adherence to a healthy DP in middle life may help preserve global cognitive function, especially verbal memory, when total energy intake is regulated.

TI  - Validity of the Turkish version of the medication adherence self-efficacy scale-short form in hypertensive patients.[Erratum appears in Anadolu Kardiyol Derg. 2012 Nov;12(7):619]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Study purpose was to examine the validity of a 13-item short form of the Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (MASES-SF) in an independent sample of 150 hypertensive Turkish patients.
AB  - METHODS: This is a methodological study and 150 adult patients, who are receiving medication for hypertension in the last one year, were included as the study sample. The sample of the study was chosen with the method of simple random sampling. The study was conducted between October 25, 2010 and December 31, 2010 at Family Health Center (FHC). In this study, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used for psychometric evaluation. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to evaluate the reliability of the scale.
AB  - RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that all goodness indexes were at acceptable quality: chi(2)=61.72, df=65, p>0.05, GFI=0.99, CFI=1.00, RMSA=0.00. Reliability coefficient of the Turkish adaptation of MASES-SF was found as 0.94 and item-total correlations ranged between 0.63 - 0.80. [corrected]. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension had lower self-efficacy scores compared to those with normal blood pressure.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This result indicated that the preliminary criterion validity is adequate. Psychometric testing demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency and validity of the instrument for patients in the study group. It can be used confidently in determining and testing interventions to improve medication adherence self-efficacy perceptions and behaviors in hypertensive Turkish patients. The MASES-SF is brief, quick to administer, and capture useful data on medication adherence self-efficacy in hypertensive patients.

TI  - Sustained decrease in blood pressure following missed doses of aliskiren or telmisartan: the ASSERTIVE double-blind, randomized study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The AliSkiren Study of profound antihypERtensive efficacy in hyperTensIVE patients (ASSERTIVE) study was designed to assess the sustained blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of aliskiren vs. telmisartan after a 7-day treatment withdrawal in patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Patients were randomized to once-daily aliskiren 150  mg (N = 414) or telmisartan 40  mg (N = 408). After 2 weeks, all patients were uptitrated to double the initial dose for 10 weeks; subsequently, all patients were treated with placebo to simulate a 7-day treatment withdrawal.
AB  - RESULTS: At the end of active treatment (EoA), similar decreases in mean ambulatory BP were observed with aliskiren and telmisartan. From EoA to day 7 of treatment withdrawal (end of withdrawal, EoW), the least squares mean increase in 24-h mean ambulatory SBP was smaller for aliskiren (2.7 mmHg) vs. telmisartan (6.5  mmHg). Between-treatment difference was significant in favour of aliskiren (-3.8  mmHg; P < 0.0001). Similar effects were observed for the increase in 24-h mean ambulatory DBP after EoW (-2.1 mmHg; P < 0.0001). Mean sitting SBP and DBP were also significantly lower with aliskiren than telmisartan after EoW with SBP (2.0  mmHg) and DBP (1.1  mmHg) differences in favour of aliskiren, already evident on day 2 after a single 'missed dose'.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Aliskiren showed a greater and more sustained BP-lowering effect than telmisartan during a 7-day treatment withdrawal. Aliskiren may provide sustained BP lowering during 1 day or more missed dose.

TI  - Baseline medication adherence and blood pressure in a 24-month longitudinal hypertension study.
AB  - AIM AND OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify the feasibility and predictive validity of an easy and quick self-reported measure of medication adherence and to identify characteristics of people with hypertension that may warrant increase attentiveness by nurses to address hypertensive self-management needs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current control rates of hypertension are approximately 50%. Effective blood pressure control can be achieved in most people with hypertension through antihypertensive medication. However, hypertension control can only be achieved if the patient is adherent with their medication regimen. Patients who are non-adherent may be in need of additional intervention.
AB  - DESIGN: This secondary analysis evaluated the systolic blood pressure of patients who received usual hypertension management across 24 months at six-month intervals.
AB  - METHODS: A longitudinal study of 159 hypertensive patients in two primary care clinics.
AB  - RESULTS: In a sample of 159 patients receiving care in a primary care facility, baseline medication non-adherence was associated with a 6.3 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05) at baseline, a 8.4 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05) at 12 months and a 7.5 increase in systolic blood pressure at 24 months (p < 0.05) compared with adherent patients, respectively. Results also indicate a significant increase in systolic blood pressure across 24 months among people who identified as minority and of low financial status.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence with antihypertensive medication at baseline was predictive of increased systolic blood pressure up to 24 months postbaseline.
AB  - RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study demonstrates the use of an easy-to-use questionnaire to identify patients who are non-adherent. We recommend assessing medication adherence to identify patients who are non-adherent with their anti-hypertensive medication and to be especially vigilant with patients who are minority or are considered low income.Copyright © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Clinical and economic outcomes of the Cincinnati Pharmacy Coaching Program for diabetes and hypertension.
AB  - PURPOSE: Value-based insurance designs (VBID) have been developed by health insurance companies and used by employers to allocate health care resources appropriately and to lower patients' out-of-pocket costs for services related to chronic conditions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the Cincinnati Pharmacy Coaching Program (CPCP) on clinical and economic outcomes. The CPCP is a VBID implemented by Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield in Ohio. It provided tailored pharmacist-based educational services and financial incentives to participants.
AB  - METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental pre/post longitudinal study in which patients were identified as they enrolled in the CPCP between Jan. 1, 2008, and Dec. 31, 2009. Patients could participate in a Diabetes Coaching Program (DCP) or a Heart Healthy Coaching Program (HHCP). Control subjects were selected from patients who were invited but did not choose to participate. Control subjects were matched to intervention cohorts using propensity score matching. Clinical (blood pressure, lipid levels, and hemoglobin A1c) and economic (all-cause and disease-attributable) outcomes were evaluated using within-subject (pre-post) and between-subject comparison (intervention-control) design.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 607 patients were enrolled in intervention groups, and 557 control subjects were selected after matching. Significant reductions were found in blood pressure, lipid levels, and hemoglobin A1c after enrollment, and a significantly greater proportion of patients, compared with controls, achieved their clinical goals according to national guidelines in both programs. Hypertension-related cost trends were favorable for HHCP relative to the control cohort. Diabetes-related costs increased for all groups from pre- to post-index, largely driven by office visits and medication costs in the DCP and inpatient/ER visits in the control cohort.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Results showed significant improvements in all diabetes- and hypertension-related clinical measures. This study shows the effect of a comprehensive VBID on the health of patients with chronic disease.

TI  - [Inertia and treatment compliance in patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care]. [Spanish]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic inertia (TI) and therapeutic compliance (TC) are 2 important barriers in achieving the therapeutic objectives recommended for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). This study analyzes the TI in patients with DM2 who do not achieve the glycemic, blood pressure (BP) and LDL-cholesterol (c-LDL) control goals, the patients' TC and the relationship between TI and TC.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive study conducted in a Primary Health Care center. We included 320 diabetic patients. Objectives of control were HbA1c < 7%, blood pressure (BP) < 130/80 mm Hg, c-LDL < 100 mg/dl, TI (when the objectives of control were not reached and the professional did not change the treatment) and TC (by counting withdrawals of pharmacy prescriptions).
AB  - RESULTS: The objectives of control for HbA1c, BP and c-LDL were reached by 66.4, 43.2 and 40.5% of patients, respectively. There was TI in the 86.4% of patients for c-LDL, in 76.7% for BP and in 40.6% for HbA1c. The percentage of therapeutic non-compliance was of 36.1, 37.5 and 32.0% for antidiabetic, antihypertensive and lipid lowering drugs, respectively. Elderly patients were better compliants. TI and TC were not associated. We did not find differences in the level of control, TI, use of drugs and TC by sex.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TI and TC play an important role in the non-consecution of the control objectives in diabetic patients, especially regarding BP and lipids. TC is not related to TI.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

TI  - Medication beliefs and antihypertensive adherence among older adults: a pilot study.
AB  - Older adults with hypertension are dependent on medication to control blood pressure and reduce risk for cardiovascular disease and renal impairment. Unfortunately, adherence to antihypertensive regimens remains low. This pilot study examines the relation among medication beliefs, demographic variables, and antihypertensive medication adherence in a sample of older adults (median age = 74 years). Medication beliefs were measured using the Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), and medication adherence was measured by electronic monitoring. Among study participants (n = 33), concerns about medications were found to be related to poorer antihypertensive adherence. In particular, older adults with lower medication adherence were concerned about dependency and long-term effects from their medications. When controlling for other factors that may influence antihypertensive adherence, beliefs about medication necessity were related to adherence (odds ratio: 2.027, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-3.75).Copyright © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

TI  - Patient factors, but not provider and health care system factors, predict medication adherence in hypertensive black men.
AB  - The problem of medication adherence is pronounced in hypertensive black men. However, factors influencing their adherence are not well understood. This secondary analysis of the ongoing Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension (CAATCH) randomized clinical trial investigated the patient, provider, and health care system factors associated with medication adherence among hypertensive black men. Participants (N=253) were aged 56.6+/-11.6 years, earned <$20,000 yearly (72.7%), and almost one half were on Medicaid (44%). Mean systolic blood pressure was 148.7+/-15.8 mm Hg and mean diastolic blood pressure was 92.7+/-9.8 mm Hg. Over one half of participants (54.9%) were nonadherent. In a hierarchical regression analysis, the patient factors that predicted medication adherence were age, self-efficacy, and depression. The final model accounted for 32.1% of the variance (F=7.80, df 10, 165, P<.001). In conclusion, age, self-efficacy, and depression were associated with antihypertensive medication adherence in black men followed in Community/Migrant Health Centers. Age is a characteristic that may allow clinicians to predict who may be at risk for poor medication adherence. Depression can be screened for and treated. Self-efficacy is modifiable and its implications for practice would be the development of interventions to increase self-efficacy in black men with hypertension.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Adherence to placebo and mortality in the Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have reported lower mortality among patients who adhere to placebo compared with those who do not. We explored this phenomenon by reanalyzing data from the placebo arm of the Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of bucindolol and mortality.
AB  - AIMS: Our primary aim was to measure and explain the association between adherence to placebo and total mortality among the placebo-allocated participants in the BEST trial. Secondary aims included assessment of the association between placebo adherence and cause-specific mortality.
AB  - METHODS: Participants with "higher placebo adherence" were defined as having taken at least 75% of their placebo study medication over the entire course of each individual's participation in the study, while those with "lower placebo adherence" took <75%. Primary outcome was in-study all-cause mortality. To account for confounding, we adjusted for all available modifiable, non-modifiable and psychosocial variables.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherent participants had a significantly lower total mortality compared to less-adherent participants (HR=0.61, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.46-0.82). Adjusting for available confounders did not change the magnitude or significance of the estimates. When considering cause-specific mortality, CVD and pump failure showed similar associations.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of the BEST trial data support a strong association between adherence to placebo study medication and total mortality. While probably not due to publication bias or simple confounding by healthy lifestyle factors, the underlying explanation for the association remains a mystery. Prospective examination of this association is necessary to better understand the underlying mechanism of this observation.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Symptoms of depression and anxiety and adherence to antihypertensive medication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to drug treatment is a major contributor to antihypertensive treatment failure. Mood disorders could impair the patient's desire and ability to follow physician's recommendations. We evaluated the role of symptoms of depression and anxiety on adherence to antihypertensive drug treatment.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal cohort study in 20-70 years old patients starting antihypertensive drug treatment, without other chronic conditions, and not taking mood-modifying drugs. Severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety were evaluated at enrollment and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of follow-up, using the Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) and the psychological general well-being index (PGWB), respectively. Treatment adherence was measured by pill count. Nonadherence was defined as taking <80% of the prescribed number of pills. Poisson regression was used to model the association of the exposures with adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: We enrolled 178 patients (58% male; mean age: 50 years; 508 follow-up visits). The risk of nonadherence was 52.6% in 12 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 46.1, 59.1). After adjusting for other risk factors, individuals with at least mild depression (BDI-II >14) and those with at least mild anxiety (PGWB anxiety score <22) were 2.48 (95% CI: 1.47, 4.18) and 1.59 (95% CI: 0.99, 2.56) times more likely to become nonadherent in the following 3 months, respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with at least mild anxiety and depression symptoms are at increased risk of becoming nonadherent to antihypertensive medication. Screening for depression and anxiety symptoms could be used to identify high-risk patients. Further evidence is needed to elucidate whether interventions targeting these conditions improve adherence.

TI  - Effect of a physician uncertainty reduction intervention on blood pressure in uncontrolled hypertensives--a cluster randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical inertia, provider failure to appropriately intensify treatment, is a major contributor to uncontrolled blood pressure (BP). Some clinical inertia may result from physician uncertainty over the patient's usual BP, adherence, or value of continuing efforts to control BP through lifestyle changes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that providing physicians with uncertainty reduction tools, including 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, electronic bottle cap monitoring, and lifestyle assessment and counseling, will lead to improved BP control.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial with five intervention clinics (IC) and five usual care clinics (UCC).
AB  - SETTING: Six public and 4 private primary care clinics.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 665 patients (63 percent African American) with uncontrolled hypertension (BP >140 mmHg/90 mmHg or >130/80 mmHg if diabetic).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: An order form for uncertainty reduction tools was placed in the IC participants' charts before each visit and results fed back to the provider.
AB  - OUTCOME MEASURES: Percent with controlled BP at last visit. Secondary outcome was BP changes from baseline.
AB  - RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 24 months. IC physicians intensified treatment in 81% of IC patients compared to 67% in UCC (p<0.001); 35.0% of IC patients and 31.9% of UCC patients achieved control at the last recorded visit (p>0.05). Multi-level mixed effects longitudinal regression modeling of SBP and DBP indicated a significant, non-linear slope difference favoring IC (p (time x group interaction)=0.048 for SBP and p=0.001 for DBP). The model-predicted difference attributable to intervention was -2.8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP by month 24, and -6.5 mmHg for both SBP and DBP by month 36.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The uncertainty reduction intervention did not achieve the pre-specified dichotomous outcome, but led to lower measured BP in IC patients.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of valsartan versus losartan and the effect of switching.[Erratum appears in J Med Econ. 2012;15(3):610]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Losartan will shortly become generic, and this may encourage switching to the generic drug. However, valsartan was shown in a meta-analysis to be statistically superior in lowering blood pressure (BP) to losartan. This paper examines the costs of treatment with these two drugs and the potential consequences of switching established valsartan patients to generic losartan.
AB  - METHODS: A US payer cost-effectiveness model was developed incorporating the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events related to systolic blood pressure (SBP) control comparing valsartan to continual losartan and switching from valsartan to generic losartan. The model, based upon a meta-analysis by Nixon et al. and Framingham equations, included first CVD event costs calculated from US administrative data sets and utility values from published sources. The modeled outcomes were number of CVD events, costs and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY).
AB  - RESULTS: Fewer patients had fatal and non-fatal CVD events with valsartan therapy compared with continual losartan and with patients switched from valsartan to generic losartan. The base-case model results indicated that continued treatment with valsartan had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $27,268 and $25,460 per life year gained, and $32,313 and $30,170 per QALY gained, relative to continual losartan and switching treatments, respectively. Sensitivity analyses found that patient discontinuation post-switching was a sensitive parameter. Including efficacy offsets with lowered adherence or discontinuation resulted in more favorable ratios for valsartan compared to switching therapy.
AB  - LIMITATIONS: The model does not evaluate post-primary CVD events and considers change in SBP from baseline level as the sole predictor of CVD risk.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Valsartan appears to be cost-effective compared to switching to generic losartan and switching to the generic drug does not support a cost offset argument over the longer term. Physicians should continue to consider the needs of individual patient and not cost offsets.

TI  - Navigating change: how outreach facilitators can help clinicians improve patient outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe outreach facilitation as an effective method of assisting and supporting primary care practices to improve processes and delivery of care.
AB  - METHODS: We spent 4 years working with 83 practices in Eastern Ontario, Canada, on the Improved Delivery of Cardiovascular Care through the Outreach Facilitation program.
AB  - RESULTS: Primary care practices, even if highly motivated, face multiple challenges when providing quality patient care. Outreach facilitation can be an effective method of assisting and supporting practices to make the changes necessary to improve processes and delivery of care. Multiple jurisdictions use outreach facilitation for system redesign, improved efficiencies, and advanced access.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The development and implementation of quality improvement programs using practice facilitation can be challenging. Our research team has learned valuable lessons in developing tools, finding resources, and assisting practices to reach their quality improvement goals. These lessons can lead to improved experiences for the practices and overall improved outcomes for the patients they serve.

TI  - Delegating responsibility from clinicians to nonprofessional personnel: the example of hypertension control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Involving nonclinician personnel in the treatment of hypertension may provide a solution to improve blood pressure control; however, this team-based approach cannot be implemented without first determining clinicians' willingness to delegate patient care to nonclinician team members. This study explores clinicians' perspectives on working with nonclinicians trained as "health coaches" to address medication adherence and lack of medication intensification among low-income patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: We used a qualitative research approach to determine clinicians' opinions on the Treat-to-Target study, an intervention to improve blood pressure control. We conducted focus groups with clinicians who practice family medicine in a safety net clinic. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic content analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Seven overarching themes emerged: (1) Clinicians support the delegation of functions to health coaches; (2) clinicians like the high frequency of coach-patient interactions; (3) clinicians feel that health coaching assists medication adherence; (4) clinicians have varying views on home titration; (5) coach-clinician communication is necessary for successful delegation; (6) coaching helps clinicians understand their patients' barriers to hypertension control; and (7) clinicians would like health coaching to continue on a permanent basis.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Clinicians appreciate the presence of nonclinicians on the primary care team. In the coming era of primary care clinician shortage, clinicians can be supportive of nonprofessional team members assisting with the care of patients with hypertension.

TI  - Higher physical fatigue predicts adherence to a 12-week exercise intervention in women with elevated blood pressure.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate predictors of exercise adherence to a 12-week exercise intervention for sedentary women and men with elevated blood pressure (BP).
AB  - METHODS: Fifty-one otherwise healthy and unmedicated adults (27 women and 24 men) with elevated BP (>120/80 mmHg but <179/109 mmHg) participated in a 12-week exercise intervention involving cardiovascular and strength training. Participants kept weekly exercise logs detailing minutes spent exercising each week. The following were assessed before and after the intervention: cardiorespiratory fitness (in mL/kg/min), body mass index (BMI), level of habitual physical activity, physical fatigue, self-efficacy for exercise habits, and social support.
AB  - RESULTS: Regression analysis revealed that mean exercise minutes/week were predicted by higher age (p < .05), higher cardiorespiratory fitness (p < .05), and a gender by physical fatigue interaction (p < .01; R2 = 0.34, F = 3.248, p < .01). Women who reported higher physical fatigue prior to the intervention spent more time exercising during the 12-week intervention than those with lower levels of physical fatigue. This relationship persisted after controlling for age, BMI, cardiorespiratory fitness, level of habitual physical activity prior to the intervention, self-efficacy for exercise habits, and social support (p < .01). The gender by physical fatigue interaction explained 13.9% of the variance in mean minutes exercised/week above and beyond the effects of covariates.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Both gender and fatigue should be considered when developing exercise interventions, such that more initial physical fatigue in women is associated with a tendency to devote greater amounts of time to exercising.

TI  - Anxiety and depression symptoms in arterial hypertension: the influence of antihypertensive treatment. the HUNT study, Norway.
AB  - Antihypertensive drugs have been suggested to modulate symptoms of depression and anxiety. It is disputed whether this is due to the hypertension per se, its treatment, or both. The aim of this study was to investigate these associations in a large population sample. 55,472 participants in the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT 2, 1995-1997), Norway, who completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression rating Scale, were divided into 3 groups according to their diastolic blood pressure and antihypertensive treatment status. A cut-off of >90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure was used to identify hypertensive status. Differences in anxiety and depression symptom levels in untreated and treated hypertensives (all treatments) versus the normotensive reference group were explained by differences in age and gender distribution in the three groups in this study. However, the receipt of two or more antihypertensive drugs was associated with depressive symptoms alone (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.03-1.90), but not with symptoms of anxiety (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.83-1.57) or mixed anxiety and depression (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.82-1.72) in the fully adjusted model, compared to untreated hypertension. Antihypertensive monotherapy (all agents) nor any single antihypertensive drug class were associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, or mixed anxiety and depression. There may be a positive association between multi antihypertensive drug use and symptoms of depression, whereas this was not found in persons with symptoms of anxiety or mixed anxiety and depression. This might reflect poor antihypertensive treatment adherence leading to polypharmacy, or other unfavorable health behaviors in people with symptoms of pure depression.

TI  - Self measurement of blood pressure for control of blood pressure levels and adherence to treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The measurement of blood pressure (BP) by the patient himself without strict protocols, adequate training, and validated equipment at their own household is defined as self measured blood pressure (SMBP).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interference of the SMBP in treatment adherence and blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: The study included 57 patients, 38 in the study group (SG) and 19 in the control group (CG). These patients were followed for 12 months and assessed at randomization (V1) as well as in the sixth (V2) and the twelfth month (V3). Compare the mean blood pressure by casual measurement, by SMBP and by ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure (AMBP), laboratory tests and the answers to the questionnaire on lifestyle. The instruments used were: OMRON HEM 714, for SMBP; OMRON 705 CP, for the casual measurement, and Monitor SPACELABS 9002 for the AMBP.
AB  - RESULTS: The average age was 62.05 +/- 10.78 in the SG and 55.42 +/- 11.87 in the CG (p = 0.03). The values of systolic blood pressure (SBP) by casual measurement in the SG and CG were: 140.01 +/- 16.73 mmHg and 141.79 +/- 23.21 mmHg in V1 (p = 0.72), 135.49 +/- 12.73 mmHg and 145.69 +/- 19.31 mmHg in V2 (p = 0.02), 131.64 +/- 19.28 mmHg and 134.88 +/- 23.21 mmHg at V3 (p = 0.59). The values of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were: 84.13 +/- 10.71 mmHg and 86.29 +/- 10.35 mmHg in V1 (p = 0.47), 81.69 +/- 10.88 mmHg and 89.61 V2 +/- 11.58 mmHg (p = 0.02), 80.31 +/- 11.83 mmHg and 86 +/- 13.38 mmHg in V3 (p = 0.12).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients in the SG had adherence to non-pharmacological treatment similar to the CG, but they had greater adherence to drug treatment and used fewer antihypertensive drugs. There was no difference between groups when comparing the metabolic profile and renal function.

TI  - Increasing physical activity in patients with asthma through positive affect and self-affirmation: a randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma engage in less physical activity than peers without asthma. Protocols are needed to prudently increase physical activity in asthma patients. We evaluated whether an educational intervention enhanced with positive-affect induction and self-affirmation was more effective than the educational protocol alone in increasing physical activity in asthma patients.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial in New York City from September 28, 2004, through July 5, 2007; of 258 asthma patients, 252 completed the trial. At enrollment, control subjects completed a survey measuring energy expenditure, made a contract to increase physical activity, received a pedometer and an asthma workbook, and then underwent bimonthly follow-up telephone calls. Intervention patients received this protocol plus small gifts and instructions in fostering positive affect and self-affirmation. The main outcome was the within-patient change in energy expenditure in kilocalories per week from enrollment to 12 months with an intent-to-treat analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean (SD) energy expenditure at enrollment was 1767 (1686) kcal/wk among controls and 1860 (1633) kcal/wk among intervention patients (P = .65) and increased by 415 (95% CI, 76-754; P = .02) and 398 (95% CI, 145-652; P = .002) kcal/wk, respectively, with no difference between groups (P = .94). For both groups, energy expenditure was sustained through 12 months. No adverse events were attributed to the trial. In multivariate analysis, increased energy expenditure was associated with less social support, decreased depressive symptoms, more follow-up calls, use of the pedometer, fulfillment of the contract, and the intervention among patients who required urgent asthma care (all P < .10, 2-sided test).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multiple-component protocol was effective in increasing physical activity in asthma patients, but an intervention to increase positive affect and self-affirmation was not effective within this protocol. The intervention may have had some benefit, however, in the subgroup of patients who required urgent asthma care during the trial. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00195117.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of positive-affect intervention and medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence explains poor blood pressure (BP) control; however African Americans suffer worse hypertension-related outcomes.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial evaluated whether a patient education intervention enhanced with positive-affect induction and self-affirmation (PA) was more effective than patient education (PE) alone in improving medication adherence and BP reduction among 256 hypertensive African Americans followed up in 2 primary care practices. Patients in both groups received a culturally tailored hypertension self-management workbook, a behavioral contract, and bimonthly telephone calls designed to help them overcome barriers to medication adherence. Also, patients in the PA group received small gifts and bimonthly telephone calls to help them incorporate positive thoughts into their daily routine and foster self-affirmation. The main outcome measures were medication adherence (assessed with electronic pill monitors) and within-patient change in BP from baseline to 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were similar in both groups: the mean BP was 137/82 mm Hg; 36% of the patients had diabetes; 11% had stroke; and 3% had chronic kidney disease. Based on the intention-to-treat principle, medication adherence at 12 months was higher in the PA group than in the PE group (42% vs 36%, respectively; P =.049). The within-group reduction in systolic BP (2.14 mm Hg vs 2.18 mm Hg; P = .98) and diastolic BP (-1.59 mm Hg vs -0.78 mm Hg; P = .45) for the PA group and PE group, respectively, was not significant.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A PE intervention enhanced with PA led to significantly higher medication adherence compared with PE alone in hypertensive African Americans. Future studies should assess the cost-effectiveness of integrating such interventions into primary care. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00227175.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of positive-affect induction to promote physical activity after percutaneous coronary intervention.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within 1 year after percutaneous coronary intervention, more than 20% of patients experience new adverse events. Physical activity confers a 25% reduction in mortality; however, physical activity is widely underused. Thus, there is a need for more powerful behavioral interventions to promote physical activity. Our objective was to motivate patients to achieve an increase in expenditure of 336 kcal/wk or more at 12 months as assessed by the Paffenbarger Physical Activity and Exercise Index.
AB  - METHODS: Two hundred forty-two patients were recruited immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention between October 2004 and October 2006. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. The patient education (PE) control group (n = 118) (1) received an educational workbook, (2) received a pedometer, and (3) set a behavioral contract for a physical activity goal. The positive-affect/self-affirmation (PA) intervention group (n = 124) received the 3 PE control components plus (1) a PA workbook chapter, (2) bimonthly induction of PA by telephone, and (3) small mailed gifts. All patients were contacted with standardized bimonthly telephone follow-up for 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Attrition was 4.5%, and 2.1% of patients died. Significantly more patients in the PA intervention group increased expenditure by 336 kcal/wk or more at 12 months, our main outcome, compared with the PE control group (54.9% vs 37.4%, P = .007). The PA intervention patients were 1.7 times more likely to reach the goal of a 336-kcal/wk or more increase by 12 months, controlling for demographic and psychosocial measures. In multivariate analysis, the PA intervention patients had nearly double the improvement in kilocalories per week at 12 months compared with the PE control patients (602 vs 328, P = .03).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients who receive PA intervention after percutaneous coronary intervention are able to achieve a sustained and clinically significant increase in physical activity by 12 months. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00248846.

TI  - Approach to antihypertensive adherence: a feasibility study on the use of student health coaches for uninsured hypertensive adults.
AB  - Despite pharmacologic advances, medication non-adherence continues to challenge primary care providers in blood pressure (BP) management. Medical, nursing and pharmacy students (n=11) were recruited and trained as health coaches for uninsured, hypertensive patients (n=25) of a free clinic in an uncontrolled open trial. Pre-post analysis was conducted on BP, medication adherence, frequency of home BP monitoring, and health behavior (eg, diet, exercise). Patient satisfaction and feasibility of a student coach model was qualitatively evaluated. In the 12 patients who completed the intervention, an increase in medication adherence as measured by the Brief Medication Questionnaire was observed (P<.01), with a 11 mmHg reduction in systolic BP (P=.03). Qualitative data showed patient satisfaction with the intervention and other health behavior change. This feasibility study shows use of student health coaches to combat medication non-adherence in uninsured, hypertensive adults is promising.

TI  - [Prevention of therapeutic inertia in the treatment of arterial hypertension by using a program of home blood pressure monitoring]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a program of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) on therapeutic Inertia (TI) in mild-to-moderate hypertension (AHT).
AB  - DESIGN: Controlled, randomised clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: Forty six clinics in 35 primary care centres. Spain.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 232 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were included.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Two groups with 116 patients were formed: 1) Control group (CG): standard health intervention; 2) Intervention group (IG): patients who were included in the HBPM program.
AB  - MAIN MEASUREMENTS: TI was calculated by the ratio: Number of patients whose pharmacological treatment was not changed in each visit/Number of patients with an average BP 140mmHg and/or 90mmHg in the general population or 130 and/or 90 mmHg in diabetics. The mean BPs and the percentage of controlled patients were calculated. The mean number of people that required an intervention in order to avoid TI was calculated (NI).
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 209 patients completed the study, with TI in 35.64% (95% CI=29.85%-41.43%) of the sample, and in 71.63% (95% CI=63.9-79.36%) of the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The TI was 22.42% (95% CI=24.2-37%) in the IG and 50% (95% CI=37.75-62.25) in the CG (p<.05) in visit 2, and 25.23% (95% CI=14.84-35.62) and 46.07% (95% CI=33.85-58.29) in the final visit for IG and CG, respectively (P<.05). The NI was 4.3.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TI was very significant among the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The studied interventions are effective for improving TI.Copyright A© 2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

TI  - A culturally adapted telecommunication system to improve physical activity, diet quality, and medication adherence among hypertensive African-Americans: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is more prevalent and clinically severe among African-Americans than whites. Several health behaviors influence blood pressure (BP) control, but effective, accessible, culturally sensitive interventions that target multiple behaviors are lacking.
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated a culturally adapted, automated telephone system to help hypertensive, urban African-American adults improve their adherence to their antihypertensive medication regimen and to evidence-based guidelines for dietary behavior and physical activity.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized 337 hypertensive primary care patients to an 8-month automated, multi-behavior intervention or to an education-only control. Medication adherence, diet, physical activity, and BP were assessed at baseline and every 4 months for 1 year. Data were analyzed using longitudinal modeling.
AB  - RESULTS: The intervention was associated with improvements in a measure of overall diet quality (+3.5 points, p<0.03) and in energy expenditure (+80 kcal/day, p<0.03). A decrease in systolic BP between groups was not statistically significant (-2.3 mmHg, p=0.25).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Given their convenience, scalability, and ability to deliver tailored messages, automated telecommunications systems can promote self-management of diet and energy balance in urban African-Americans.

TI  - Comparison of associations of adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet with risks of cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) share some risk factors, including obesity, but it is unclear how dietary patterns associated with reduced risk of CVD relate to risk of VTE.
AB  - OBJECTIVE:  To compare the relationships of adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet with the risks of CVD and VTE.
AB  - PATIENTS/METHODS: We confirmed by medical record review 1094 incident cases of CVD and 675 incident VTEs during a mean follow-up of 14.6 years in 34 827 initially healthy participants in the Women's Health Study who completed at baseline a 133-item food frequency questionnaire scored for adherence to a DASH diet. We compared estimated associations of dietary patterns with CVD and VTE from proportional hazards models in a competing risk framework.
AB  - RESULTS: Initial analyses adjusted for age, energy intake and randomized treatments showed 36-41% reduced hazards of CVD among women in the top two quintiles of DASH score relative to those in the bottom quintile (P(trend) < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, women in the top two quintiles had 12-23% reduced hazards of CVD relative to women in the bottom quintile (P(trend) = 0.04). Analyses restricted to coronary events showed more variable 10-33% reduced hazards in the top two quintiles (P(trend) = 0.09). In contrast, higher DASH scores were unrelated to risk of VTE, with a 1% reduced hazard for the top vs. bottom quintile (P(trend) = 0.95).
AB  - CONCLUSION: An apparently strong association of adherence to the DASH diet with incidence of CVD was attenuated upon control for confounding variables. Adherence to the DASH diet was not associated with risk of VTE in women.Copyright © 2011 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

TI  - Qualitative analysis of peer coaches' experiences with counseling African Americans about reducing heart disease risk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite mounting evidence that peer coaches can make significant contributions to patient health, little is known about factors that must be addressed to engage and retain them in their role.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify motivators and barriers to serving as a peer coach.
AB  - DESIGN: Open ended semi-structured interviews.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: In a randomized trial of peer support, patients with well controlled hypertension and good interpersonal skills were recruited and trained to serve as peer coaches for African-American patients from the same practices who had poorly controlled hypertension. Peer coaches spoke by telephone at least three times with their same sex patient-clients on alternate months during the 6-month intervention and counseled about medication adherence as well as other healthy lifestyles.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Of 15 trained peer coaches, ten were contacted and agreed to participate in the qualitative interview. Peer coaches had a mean age of 66 years, 50% were women, and 80% were African-American. Themes regarding favorable aspects of the peer coach experience included: meaning and satisfaction derived from contributing to community health and the personal emotional and physical benefits derived from serving as a peer coach. Negative aspects centered on: challenges in establishing the initial telephone contact and wanting more information about their patient-clients' personal health conditions and status. Peer coaches endorsed gender matching but were less clear about race-matching.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Programs that utilize peer support to enhance positive health behaviors should recognize that a spirit of volunteerism motivates many successful peer coaches. Program planners should acknowledge the special characteristics required of successful peer coaches when selecting, motivating and training individuals for this role.

TI  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and bevacizumab for HER2-negative breast cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A, has shown clinical efficacy in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer. We evaluated the efficacy, measured according to the rate of pathological complete response (absence of invasive and intraductal disease in the breast and the axillary lymph nodes), and the safety of adding bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer.
AB  - METHODS: We randomly assigned 1948 patients with a median tumor size of 40 mm on palpation to receive neoadjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, with or without concomitant bevacizumab. Patients with untreated HER2-negative breast cancer were eligible if they had large tumors, hormone-receptor-negative disease, or hormone-receptor-positive disease with palpable nodes or positive findings on sentinel-node biopsy, and no increased cardiovascular or bleeding risk.
AB  - RESULTS: Overall, the rates of pathological complete response were 14.9% with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel and 18.4% with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus bevacizumab (odds ratio with addition of bevacizumab, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.65; P=0.04); the corresponding rates of pathological complete response were 27.9% and 39.3% among 663 patients with triple-negative tumors (P=0.003) and 7.8% and 7.7% among 1262 patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumors (P=1.00). Breast-conserving surgery was possible in 66.6% of the patients in both groups. The addition of bevacizumab, as compared with neoadjuvant therapy alone, was associated with a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxic effects (febrile neutropenia, mucositis, the hand-foot syndrome, infection, and hypertension) but with a similar incidence of surgical complications.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased the rate of pathological complete response among patients with HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer. Efficacy was restricted primarily to patients with triple-negative tumors, in whom the pathological complete response is considered to be a reliable predictor of long-term outcome.

TI  - Managing side effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy to optimize adherence in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia: the role of the midlevel practitioner.
AB  - In the last decade, the development of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has brought about unprecedented change in the way newly diagnosed, chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients are treated. Two next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, nilotinib and dasatinib, were initially indicated for imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia patients and recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of newly diagnosed, chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients. In comparison with the previous standards of care, benefits with these three tyrosine kinase inhibitors have included more rapid response rates, increased survival, and fewer side effects. The improved long-term outcomes have altered the approach to management of chronic myeloid leukemia from a progressive fatal disease with a poor prognosis to a chronic condition similar to diabetes or hypertension. Prolonged survival increases the need for patient education, support, monitoring, and assistance with adverse event management. Even low-grade side effects can adversely affect patients' quality of life and, therefore, require prompt attention to prevent long-term complications or suboptimal outcomes. New evidence has indicated that patient adherence to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is essential to successful treatment. Midlevel practitioners can help to optimize outcomes by educating patients regarding the importance of adherence, performing regular monitoring, helping patients to understand their test results, and aggressively managing treatment-related side effects.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Adherence therapy for medication non-compliant patients with hypertension: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - The objective of this study is to establish the efficacy of adherence therapy (AT) compared with treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing blood pressure (BP) in non-compliant hypertensive patients. This study was designed as a parallel-group single-blind randomised controlled trial. The study was carried out at three general hospital outpatient clinics in Jordan. A total of 136 non-compliant hypertensive patients with a mean baseline BP of 164.5mmHg (s.d. 10.0) over 102.2mmHg (s.d. 7.0) participated in the study. 7 weekly 20-min sessions of AT in addition to TAU. The main outcome of this study is systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 11-weeks follow-up. In all, 68 patients received TAU and 68 AT. Intention-to-treat analysis included all participants randomised. AT lowered SBP by -23.11mmHg (95% CI: -25.85, -20.36) and diastolic BP (DBP) by -15.18mmHg (95% CI: -17.55, -12.80) at 11 weeks compared with TAU. Adherence (measured by pill counting) was also improved in the AT group by 37% at 11 weeks compared with TAU. No significant adverse events were reported. AT increases adherence to medication for hypertension which then leads to a clinically important reduction in BP.

TI  - Embolic protection device use and outcomes in patients receiving saphenous vein graft interventions--a single-center experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Percutaneous treatment of saphenous vein graft disease is hampered by high rates of periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI). The use of embolic protection devices (EPD) during these interventions is a class IB recommendation when technically feasible, yet they are used routinely in less than half of all cases. Our aim was to explore whether or not the under-utilization of EPDs led to any untoward cardiovascular events.
AB  - METHODS: Consecutive vein graft interventions from 2003-2008 were identified and stratified by EPD use. Information pertaining to demographics, comorbidities, medication use, and procedural details was collected. Primary endpoint was to compare the incidence of periprocedural MI, defined as any creatinine kinase-MB fraction elevation greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal between patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for saphenous vein grafts (SVG) with EPD versus patients who underwent PCI for SVG without EPD. Secondary endpoints included comparison of the incidence of recurrent ischemia, MI, revascularization (PCI or coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]), and mortality in the above 2 groups by the end of 1 year.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 164 consecutive vein graft interventions were identified. EPDs were used in 71 cases (43.4%). The EPD group was further out since their CABG and had a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes. Periprocedural MI occurred in 22 cases; 12 in the non-EPD group and 10 in the EPD group (14.1 vs. 12.9%; P=.82). The composite endpoint of death, MI, or target vessel revascularization at 12 months was significantly lower when EPDs were used (11.3 vs. 25.8%; P=.03). On multivariate analysis, chronic kidney disease increased the risk of periprocedural MI (odds ratio [OR], 5.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-15.13; P=.002), whereas the use of beta-blockers was protective (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.07-0.70; P=.011).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: EPD use during vein graft interventions did not improve periprocedural MI rates. However, the composite endpoint of adverse cardiovascular outcomes at 1 year was significantly reduced. EPDs are used in a minority of vein graft interventions. Efforts aimed at improving adherence to EPD use may improve long-term outcomes, though this hypothesis should be tested using prospective, randomized studies.

TI  - Electronic monitoring of adherence, treatment of hypertension, and blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although it is generally acknowledged that electronic monitoring of adherence to treatment improves blood pressure (BP) control by increasing patients' awareness to their treatment, little information is available on the long-term effect of this intervention.
AB  - METHODS: In this observational study among a total of 470 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, adherence was measured in 228 patients by means of both the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) and pill count (intervention group), and in 242 patients by means of pill count alone (control group). During a follow-up period of 1 year consisting of seven visits to the physician's office, BP measurements were performed and medication adjusted based on the achieved BP. In addition, at each visit adherence to treatment was assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: On the basis of pill counts, median adherence to treatment did not differ between the intervention group and the control group (96.1% vs. 94.2%; P = 0.97). In both groups, systolic and diastolic BP decreased similarly: 23/13 vs. 22/12 mm Hg in the intervention and control group respectively. Drug changes and the number of drugs used were associated with BP at the start of study, but not with electronic monitoring.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this study, electronic monitoring of adherence to treatment by means of MEMS did not lead to better long-term BP control nor did it result in less drug changes and drug use.

TI  - Aliskiren inhibits atherosclerosis development and improves plaque stability in APOE*3Leiden.CETP transgenic mice with or without treatment with atorvastatin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aliskiren is the first commercially available, orally active, direct renin inhibitor approved to treat hypertension. The renin-angiotensin system has been shown to be a significant contributor to the development of hypercholesterolemia-induced atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiatherosclerotic and plaque stabilization effects of aliskiren alone and in combination with atorvastatin.
AB  - METHODS: APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice (n = 14-17/group) were fed a western-type diet (containing 0.25% cholesterol) alone or were treated with either aliskiren (15 mg/kg per day), atorvastatin (3.6 mg/kg per day) or a combination of aliskiren and atorvastatin. Effects on SBP, total cholesterol, inflammation markers and atherosclerotic size and composition were assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: Aliskiren reduced SBP (-19%, P < 0.001) and atorvastatin reduced total cholesterol (-24%, P < 0.001). Atherosclerotic lesion area was reduced by aliskiren (-40%, P < 0.01), atorvastatin (-61%, P < 0.001) and the combination treatment (-69%, P < 0.001). Aliskiren alone and together with atorvastatin decreased the number of T cells in the aortic root area (-60%, P < 0.01; -41%, P < 0.05), as well as macrophage (-64%, P < 0.001; -72%, P < 0.001) and necrotic area (-52%, P = 0.071; -84%, P < 0.001) in the lesion. Atorvastatin alone and together with aliskiren decreased monocyte adherence (-43%, P < 0.05 and -51%, P < 0.01) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (both -36%, P < 0.01). The combination treatment decreased the number of lesions (-17%, P < 0.05) and E-selectin (-17%, P < 0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Aliskiren inhibited atherosclerosis development and improved plaque stability alone and in combination with atorvastatin, possibly via a mechanism involving T cells. These results suggest a potential benefit of using aliskiren in a clinical setting, particularly in combination with statin treatment.

TI  - Quantifying the 3 Biases That Lead to Unintentional Overestimation of the Blood Pressure-Lowering Effect of Renal Denervation. [Review]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of renal denervation report disparate results. Meta-analysis by trial design may allow quantitative estimation of sources and magnitude of biases in denervation studies.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred forty nonrandomized, 6 randomized open-label, and 2 randomized blinded studies were analyzed for 2 outcomes: (1) blood pressure changes for nonrandomized, open-label randomized, and blinded studies; and (2) quantification of 3 biases potentially contributing to apparent antihypertensive effects: (a) regression to the mean, (b) asymmetrical data handling, and (c) true blood pressure drops caused by something other than the tested therapy (confounding). Nonrandomized studies and open-label randomized trials reported large reductions in office blood pressure of 23.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.0 to 25.3) and 29.1 mm Hg (95% CI, 25.2 to 33.1 mm Hg), respectively. They reported smaller reductions in ambulatory blood pressures (11.2 mm Hg; 95% CI, 10.0 to 12.4). The blinded trials found no significant reduction in blood pressure (2.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -0.4 to 6.3). Analyses of these data indicate the magnitude of the 3 potential sources of bias to be regression to the mean, -1.01 mm Hg (95% CI, 4.24 to -6.27); asymmetrical data handling, -10.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -8.77 to -12.87); and confounding, -8.3 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.73 to -11.83).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Increasingly bias-resistant trial designs report effect sizes of decreasing magnitude. This disparity may be caused by asymmetrical data handling and confounding (eg, increased drug adherence). If these differences are caused by trial design and not by some other differences in patients or procedures, which happen to match the trial design, then randomization alone is not enough: blinding is also needed. This has broad implications across trials of medications and devices.Copyright © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.

TI  - Protocol Deviations before and after Treatment with Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator in Community Hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protocol deviations before and after tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment for ischemic stroke are common. It is unclear if patient or hospital factors predict protocol deviations. We examined predictors of protocol deviations and the effects of protocol violations on symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH).
AB  - METHODS: We used data from the Increasing Stroke Treatment through Interventional Behavior Change Tactics trial, a cluster-randomized, controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a barrier assessment and educational intervention to increase appropriate tPA use in 24 Michigan community hospitals, to review tPA treatments between 2007 and 2010. Protocol violations were defined as deviations from the standard tPA protocol, both before and after treatment. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to determine if patient and hospital variables were associated with pretreatment or post-treatment protocol deviations.
AB  - RESULTS: During the study, 557 patients (mean age 70, 52% male, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 12) were treated with tPA. Protocol deviations occurred in 233 (42%) patients: 16% had pretreatment deviations, 35% had post-treatment deviations, and 9% had both. The most common protocol deviations included elevated post-treatment blood pressure, antithrombotic agent use within 24 hours of treatment, and elevated pretreatment blood pressure. Protocol deviations were not associated with sICH, stroke severity, or hospital factors. Older age was associated with pretreatment protocol deviations (adjusted odds ratio [OR], .52; 95% confidence interval [CI], .30-.92). Pretreatment deviations were associated with post-treatment deviations (adjusted OR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.91-5.35).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Protocol deviations were not associated with sICH. Aside from age, patient and hospital factors were not associated with protocol deviations.Copyright © 2015 National Stroke Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Successful Multifaceted Trial to Improve Hypertension Control in Primary Care: Why Did it Work?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is important to understand which components of successful multifaceted interventions are responsible for study outcomes, since some components may be more important contributors to the intervention effect than others.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conducted a mediation analysis to determine which of seven factors had the greatest effect on change in systolic blood pressure (BP) after 6 months in a trial to improve hypertension control.
AB  - DESIGN: The study was a preplanned secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized clinical trial. Eight clinics in an integrated health system were randomized to provide usual care to their patients (n=222), and eight were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n=228).
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred three of 450 trial participants completing the 6-month follow-up visit were included.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Intervention group participants received home BP telemonitors and transmitted measurements to pharmacists, who adjusted medications and provided advice to improve adherence to medications and lifestyle modification via telephone visits.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Path analytic models estimated indirect effects of the seven potential mediators of intervention effect (defined as the difference between the intervention and usual care groups in change in systolic BP from baseline to 6 months). The potential mediators were change in home BP monitor use, number of BP medication classes, adherence to BP medications, physical activity, salt intake, alcohol use, and weight.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: The difference in change in systolic BP was 11.3 mmHg. The multivariable mediation model explained 47 % (5.3 mmHg) of the intervention effect. Nearly all of this was mediated by two factors: an increase in medication treatment intensity (24 %) and increased home BP monitor use (19 %). The other five factors were not significant mediators, although medication adherence and salt intake improved more in the intervention group than in the usual care group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Most of the explained intervention effect was attributable to the combination of self-monitoring and medication intensification. High adherence at baseline and the relatively low intensity of resources directed toward lifestyle change may explain why these factors did not contribute to the improvement in BP.

TI  - Outcomes of a Seven Practice Pilot in a Pay-For-Performance (P4P)-Based Program in Pennsylvania.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine how targeted six-month interventions impacted Best Practice/Patient Outcomes for minority patients receiving primary care in physician practices participating in a pay-for-performance (P4P) program.
AB  - METHODS: P4P Practices were invited to participate in a pilot intervention study designed to improve care for minority patients with hypertension, diabetes or pediatric asthma. Patient medical records were reviewed to assess how the interventions impacted (n=7 practices): Body mass index, diet and exercise, smoking, compliance with visits as recommended, blood pressure, sodium intake and weight management counseling, medication reconciliation, HbA1c testing, annual lipid profile, and anti-inflammatory medications.
AB  - RESULTS: Significant improvements in various clinical quality measures were observed in all seven practices. Of the 19 specified interventions, 13 were statistically significant at alpha=0.05 level and 14 met the target proportion. This suggests that the best practice intervention had a significant impact on some of the health care processes in the physician practices.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The most impactful interventions were those related to face-to-face educational discussions, patient medical chart documentations rather than those pertaining to medication adherence. Improvements in measuring reporting and recording of data at post-intervention were also observed.

TI  - Evaluating the safety and efficacy of sodium-restricted/Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet after acute decompensated heart failure hospitalization: design and rationale for the Geriatric OUt of hospital Randomized MEal Trial in Heart Failure (GOURMET-HF).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem affecting predominantly older adults. Nonadherence to diet remains a significant contributor to acute decompensated HF (ADHF). The sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD) eating plan reduces cardiovascular dysfunction that can lead to ADHF and is consistent with current HF guidelines. We propose that an intervention that promotes adherence to the DASH/SRD by home-delivering meals will be safe and improve health-related quality of life (QOL) in older adults after hospitalization for ADHF.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 3-center, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial of 12-week duration designed to determine the safety and efficacy of home-delivered DASH/SRD-compliant meals in older adults after discharge from ADHF hospitalization. Sixty-six subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 stratified fashion by gender and left ventricular ejection fraction (<50% vs >50%). Study subjects will receive either preprepared, home-delivered DASH/SRD-compliant meals or usual dietary advice for 4weeks after hospital discharge. Investigators will be blinded to group assignment, food diaries, and urinary electrolyte measurements until study completion. The primary efficacy end point is the change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary scores for health-related QOL from study enrollment to 4weeks postdischarge. Safety evaluation will focus on hypotension, renal insufficiency, and hyperkalemia. Exploratory end points include echocardiography, noninvasive vascular testing, markers of oxidative stress, and salt taste sensitivity.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of 4weeks of DASH/SRD after ADHF hospitalization. By testing a novel dietary intervention supported by multiple levels of evidence including preliminary data in outpatients with stable HF, we will address a critical evidence gap in the care of older patients with ADHF. If effective and safe, this intervention could be scaled to assess effects on readmission and healthcare costs in older adults after ADHF.Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Brief provider communication skills training fails to impact patient hypertension outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypertension remains a prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and improved medication adherence leads to better blood pressure (BP) control. We sought to improve medication adherence and hypertension outcomes among patients with uncontrolled BP through communication skills training targeting providers.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a communication skills intervention for primary care doctors compared to usual care controls, on the outcomes of BP (systolic, diastolic), patient self-reported medication adherence, and provider counseling, assessed at baseline and post-intervention. We enrolled 379 patients with uncontrolled BP; 203 (54%) with follow-up data comprised our final sample. We performed random effects least squares regression analyses to examine whether the provider training improved outcomes, using clinics as the unit of randomization.
AB  - RESULTS: In neither unadjusted nor multivariate analyses were significant differences in change detected from baseline to follow-up in provider counseling, medication adherence or BP, for the intervention versus control groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention did not improve the outcomes; it may have been too brief and lacked sufficient practice level changes to impact counseling, adherence or BP.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future intervention efforts may require more extensive provider training, along with broader systematic changes, to improve patient outcomes.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The effect of a community-based self-help multimodal behavioral intervention in Korean American seniors with high blood pressure.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Great strides have been made in improving heart health in the United States during the last 2 decades, yet these strides have not encompassed many ethnic minority populations. There are significant health disparity gaps stemming from both a paucity of valid research and a lack of culturally sensitive interventions. In particular, many Korean Americans with chronic illnesses encounter difficulty navigating the healthcare system because of limited health literacy.
AB  - METHODS: The effect of a multimodal Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of High Blood Pressure (HBP) was tested in a community-based clinical trial for Korean American seniors. Of 440 seniors enrolled, 369 completed the study (184 in the intervention group and 185 in the control group; mean age = 70.9+/-5.3 years). The intervention group received 6 weekly educational sessions on HBP management skill building, including health literacy training, followed by telephone counseling and home blood pressure (BP) monitoring for 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Findings support that the Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of HBP was effective in controlling BP in this ethnic/linguistic minority population. The BP control rates for the intervention and control groups were 49.5% vs. 43.2% at baseline, 58.5% vs. 42.4% at 6 months, 67.9% vs. 52.5% at 12 months, and 54.3% vs. 53.0% at 18 months. Significant changes were observed over time in some psychobehavioral outcomes, including self-efficacy for BP control, medication adherence behavior, HBP knowledge, and depression.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that the multimodal Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of HBP is effective at promoting optimal HBP control for this ethnic/linguistic minority population.

TI  - Improving adherence to glaucoma medication: a randomised controlled trial of a patient-centred intervention (The Norwich Adherence Glaucoma Study).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving adherence to ocular hypertension (OH)/glaucoma therapy is highly likely to prevent or reduce progression of optic nerve damage. The present study used a behaviour change counselling intervention to determine whether education and support was beneficial and cost-effective in improving adherence with glaucoma therapy.
AB  - METHODS: A randomised controlled trial with a 13-month recruitment and 8-month follow-up period was conducted. Patients with OH/glaucoma attending a glaucoma clinic and starting treatment with travoprost were approached. Participants were randomised into two groups and adherence was measured over 8 months, using an electronic monitoring device (Travalert dosing aid, TDA). The control group received standard clinical care, and the intervention group received a novel glaucoma education and motivational support package using behaviour change counselling. Cost-effectiveness framework analysis was used to estimate any potential cost benefit of improving adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Two hundred and eight patients were recruited (102 intervention, 106 control). No significant difference in mean adherence over the monitoring period was identified with 77.2% (CI, 73.0, 81.4) for the control group and 74.8% (CI, 69.7, 79.9) for the intervention group (p = 0.47). Similarly, there was no significant difference in percentage intraocular pressure reduction; 27.6% (CI, 23.5, 31.7) for the control group and 25.3% (CI, 21.06, 29.54) for the intervention group (p = 0.45). Participants in the intervention group were more satisfied with information about glaucoma medication with a mean score of 14.47/17 (CI, 13.85, 15.0) compared with control group which was 8.51 (CI, 7.72, 9.30). The mean intervention cost per patient was GB10.35 (<US$16) and not cost-effective.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adherence with travoprost was high and not further increased by the intervention. Nevertheless, the study demonstrated that provision of information, tailored to the individual, was inexpensive and able to achieve high patient satisfaction with respect to information about glaucoma medication. Measurement of adherence remains problematic since awareness of study participation may cause a change in participant behaviour.

TI  - A community health worker intervention to improve management of hypertension among Filipino Americans in New York and New Jersey: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the pilot study was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a 4-month community health worker (CHW) intervention to improve hypertension management among Filipino immigrants in New York and New Jersey.
AB  - DESIGN: Single-arm CHW pilot intervention using a pre-post design delivered by 5 CHWs.
AB  - SETTING: New York City, NY and Jersey City, NJ.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Of 88 Filipino individuals recruited for the study, 39 received the full pilot intervention, 18 received a partial intervention, and 31 dropped out; 13 Filipino participants, 10 CHW Trainers, and 3 Filipino CHWs were interviewed for qualitative analysis.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Individuals participated in 4 workshops related to hypertension management and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and received monthly in-person visits, and twice monthly phone calls individually from a CHW.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included blood pressure (BP) reduction and control, appointment keeping, and medication adherence; secondary outcomes included weight, body mass index (BMI), self-efficacy related to diet, exercise, and medication taking, CVD knowledge, and nutrition (salt/ sodium and cholesterol/fat).
AB  - RESULTS: A mixed method analysis was used to assess the intervention, utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods. By the end of the intervention, significant changes were exhibited for systolic and diastolic BP, weight, and BMI (P<.01). Significant changes were not seen for medication adherence and appointment keeping, however, CVD knowledge and self-efficacy related to diet and weight management all improved significantly (P<.01). Qualitative findings provided additional information on the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of the intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This pilot CHW intervention showed evidence of feasibility, as well as efficacy, in improving hypertension management and reducing CVD factors in Filipino Americans.

TI  - Tailored Case Management for Diabetes and Hypertension (TEACH-DM) in a community population: study design and baseline sample characteristics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recognition of the benefits associated with well-controlled diabetes and hypertension, control remains suboptimal. Effective interventions for these conditions have been studied within academic settings, but interventions targeting both conditions have rarely been tested in community settings. We describe the design and baseline results of a trial evaluating a behavioral intervention among community patients with poorly-controlled diabetes and comorbid hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Tailored Case Management for Diabetes and Hypertension (TEACH-DM) is a 24-month randomized, controlled trial evaluating a telephone-delivered behavioral intervention for diabetes and hypertension versus attention control. The study recruited from nine community practices. The nurse-administered intervention targets 3 areas: 1) cultivation of healthful behaviors for diabetes and hypertension control; 2) provision of fundamentals to support attainment of healthful behaviors; and 3) identification and correction of patient-specific barriers to adopting healthful behaviors. Hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure measured at 6, 12, and 24 months are co-primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, self-reported medication adherence, exercise, and cost-effectiveness.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 377 randomized patients, 193 were allocated to the intervention and 184 to attention control. The cohort is balanced in terms of gender, race, education level, and income. The cohort's mean baseline hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure are above goal, and mean baseline body mass index falls in the obese range. Baseline self-reported non-adherence is high for diabetes and hypertension medications. Trial results are pending.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: If effective, the TEACH-DM intervention's telephone-based delivery strategy and nurse administration make it well-suited for rapid implementation and broad dissemination in community settings.Copyright © 2013.

TI  - Characteristics, drug combinations and dosages of primary care patients with uncontrolled ambulatory blood pressure and high medication adherence.
AB  - Most studies on the prevalence and determinants of resistant hypertension (RH) do not account for white coat hypertension, medication non-adherence, or use of suboptimal treatment dosages. We studied the characteristics, drug combinations, and dosages of patients on at least three antihypertensives of different classes who had uncontrolled blood pressure on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and high medication adherence measured by electronic monitoring. The data were collected as part of the baseline measures of a hypertension control trial. Of 140 monitored primary care patients, all with uncontrolled office blood pressure, 69 (49%) were on at least three antihypertensives of different classes. Of these 69, 15 (22%) were controlled on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 20 (29%) were uncontrolled and non-adherent, leaving only 34 (49%) adherent to their medications and having uncontrolled ambulatory hypertension (uncontrolled RH). Thirty-one (91%) of the 34 uncontrolled RH patients were prescribed a diuretic, of which 24 were on hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Less than half of the patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or calcium channel blocker were prescribed maximal doses of these agents. Half of the RH can be attributed to white coat effect and poor medication adherence, and all of the remaining patients were on apparently suboptimal drug combinations and/or dosages. Primary care physicians need to be educated regarding the optimal treatment of RH. Copyright © 2013 American Society of Hypertension. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Disparities in antihypertensive medication adherence in adolescents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects up to 5 % of all children, but little is known about the role of medication adherence on blood pressure (BP) control. In this study we examined the association between adolescents' antihypertensive medication adherence and BP control, investigating for racial disparities.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 21 adolescents with essential hypertension [mean age 14.7 +/- 2.0 years, 57 % male, 52 % African American] were recruited from a pediatric nephrology clinic. Objective medication adherence measures were obtained with Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps and pharmacy refill records to determine medication possession ratios (MPRs).
AB  - RESULTS: The African Americans adolescents had lower medication adherence than non-African Americans adolescents based on the MPR over the past 12 months (mean 0.54 +/- 0.21 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.16, respectively; p < 0.001) and a trend for less adherence measured by MEMS caps over the last 28 days (mean 0.75 +/- 0.26 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.04, respectively; p < 0.07). Seven of the eight participants with low adherence (MPR <0.65) had uncontrolled BP (systolic and/or diastolic BPs > 95th percentile), and no participants with high adherence according to the MPR had uncontrolled BP (p < 0.001). There was no difference in BP control by race.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive medication adherence measured by pharmacy refills was associated with BP control. AAs were more likely to have lower medication adherence. Targeting medication adherence through the use of electronic medical records may be a potential mechanism to reduce health disparities.

TI  - The Trial Using Motivational Interviewing and Positive Affect and Self-Affirmation in African-Americans with Hypertension (TRIUMPH): from theory to clinical trial implementation.
AB  - This paper describes the application of a translational research model in developing The Trial Using Motivational Interviewing and Positive Affect and Self-Affirmation in African-Americans with Hypertension (TRIUMPH), a theoretically-based, randomized controlled trial. TRIUMPH targets blood pressure control among African-Americans with hypertension in a community health center and public hospital setting. TRIUMPH applies positive affect, self-affirmation, and motivational interviewing as strategies to increase medication adherence and blood pressure control. A total of 220 participants were recruited in TRIUMPH and are currently being followed. This paper provides a detailed description of the theoretical framework and study design of TRIUMPH and concludes with a critical reflection of the lessons learned in the process of implementing a health behavior intervention in a community-based setting. TRIUMPH provides a model for incorporating the translational science research paradigm to conducting pragmatic behavioral trials in a real-world setting in a vulnerable population. Lessons learned through interactions with our community partners reinforce the value of community engagement in research.Copyright © 2013. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Implementation of a web-based tool for patient medication self-management: the Medication Self-titration Evaluation Programme (Med-STEP) for blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Informatics tools may help support hypertension management.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To design, implement and evaluate a web-based system for patient anti-hypertensive medication self-titration.
AB  - METHODS: Study stages included: six focus groups (50 patients) to identify barriers/facilitators to patient medication self-titration, software design informed by qualitative analysis of focus group responses and a six-month single-arm pilot study (20 patients) to assess implementation feasibility.
AB  - RESULTS: Focus groups emphasised patient need to feel confident that their own primary care providers were directly involved and approved of the titration protocol. Physicians required 3.3 +/- 2.8 minutes/patient to create individualised six-step medication pathways for once-monthly blood pressure evaluations. Pilot participants (mean age of 51.5 +/- 11 years, 45% women, mean baseline blood pressure 139/84 +/- 12.2/7.5 mmHg) had five medication increases, two non-adherence self-reports, 52 months not requiring medication changes, 24 skipped months and 17 months with no evaluations due to technical issues. Four pilot patients dropped out before study completion. From baseline to study completion, blood pressure decreased among the 16 patients remaining in the study (8.0/4.7 mmHg, p = 0.03 for both systolic and diastolic pressures).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learned included the benefit of qualitative patient analysis prior to system development and the feasibility of physicians designing individual treatment pathways. Any potential clinical benefits were offset by technical problems, the tendency for patients to skip their monthly self-evaluations and drop outs. To be more widely adopted such systems must effectively generalise to a wider range of patients and be integrated into clinical workflow.

TI  - Protocol for a randomised controlled trial to estimate the effects and costs of a patient centred educational intervention in glaucoma management.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor glaucoma education is thought to be a causative factor of non-adherence to glaucoma therapy. However, the multi-factorial nature of non-adherent behaviour may explain the failure of purely educational interventions to achieve significant improvement in adherence. Behaviour Change Counselling (BCC) allows both the imparting of information and assessment of patient ambivalence to medication use and may elicit behaviour change in order to achieve better adherence. The chronic and complex nature of glaucoma means that patient non-adherence to glaucoma therapy does not easily correlate with measureable objective clinical endpoints. However, electronic medication monitoring offers an objective method of measuring adherence without reliance on clinical endpoints.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with glaucoma (open angle) or ocular hypertension patients attending a glaucoma clinic and prescribed travoprost. The study will determine whether additional glaucoma education using BCC is beneficial and cost effective in improving adherence with glaucoma therapy. An 8-month follow-up period, using an electronic adherence monitoring device (Travalert dosing aid, TDA), will indicate if the intervention is likely to be sustained in the longer term. Additionally, a cost-effectiveness framework will be used to estimate the cost benefit of improving adherence. The development of a novel intervention to deliver glaucoma education using BCC required practitioner training and fidelity testing. Five practitioners were successfully trained to become Glaucoma Support Assistants able to deliver the BCC intervention. The research group had prior clinical and investigative experience in this setting, and used multiple strategies to design a method to address the study objectives.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This RCT, using BCC to improve adherence to ocular hypotensive therapy, to our knowledge is the first within this disease area. Using a variety of adherence measures allows examination of the known inaccuracies of patient self-report with respect to glaucoma medication. The novel BCC component has undergone fidelity testing using BECCI and the BCC template will ensure conformity to a standardised intervention.

TI  - Factors associated with non-adherence to three hypertension self-management behaviors: preliminary data for a new instrument.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians have difficulty in identifying patients that are unlikely to adhere to hypertension self-management. Identifying non-adherence is essential to addressing suboptimal blood pressure control and high costs.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: 1) To identify risk factors associated with non-adherence to three key self-management behaviors in patients with hypertension: proper medication use, diet, and exercise; 2) To evaluate the extent to which an instrument designed to identify the number of risk factors present for non-adherence to each of the three hypertension self-management behaviors would be associated with self-management non-adherence and blood pressure.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of randomized trial data.
AB  - PATIENTS: Six hundred and thirty-six primary care patients with hypertension.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: 1) Demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and health belief-related factors; 2) measures of self-reported adherence to recommended medication use, diet recommendations, and exercise recommendations, all collected at baseline assessment; 3) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
AB  - RESULTS: We identified patient factors associated with measures of non-adherence to medications, diet, and exercise in hypertension. We then combined risk factors associated with >1 adherence measure into an instrument that generated three composite variables (medication, diet, and exercise composites), reflecting the number of risk factors present for non-adherence to the corresponding self-management behavior. These composite variables identified subgroups with higher likelihood of medication non-adherence, difficulty following diet recommendations, and difficulty following exercise recommendations. Composite variable levels representing the highest number of self-management non-adherence risk factors were associated with higher SBP and DBP.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We identified factors associated with measures of non-adherence to recommended medication use, diet, and exercise in hypertension. We then developed an instrument that was associated with non-adherence to these self-management behaviors, as well as with blood pressure. With further study, this instrument has potential to improve identification of non-adherent patients with hypertension.

TI  - Influence of living arrangements on the management and control of hypertension: a mixed-methods study of Korean American elderly.
AB  - Elders living alone may experience worse health outcomes than do those living with spouse and/or children. Using baseline data from a randomized trial to promote high blood pressure (HBP) control in Korean elders (N = 440), we examined the relationship between living arrangements and HBP control. We also interviewed a sub-sample to better understand the patterns of social interactions associated with different types of living arrangements. One in five reported living alone; this group tended to be older and female, and resided in senior group housing. Those living alone were twice as likely as those living with a spouse to have controlled BP (OR = 2.08; 95 % CI 1.09-3.97), even after controlling for study covariates. Those in senior group housing had frequent social interactions that involved conversations around health, encouragement concerning medication taking, and health information sharing. In conclusion, Korean elders living independently are neither socially-isolated nor at increased risk for poor BP control.

TI  - Relationship of blood pressure self-monitoring, medication adherence, self-efficacy, stage of change, and blood pressure control among municipal workers with hypertension.
AB  - Uncontrolled blood pressure remains a major public health issue. Medication adherence is a key factor in blood pressure management; however, adherence behavior is not clearly understood and the most significant factors contributing to poor medication adherence and blood pressure control are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of self-monitoring of blood pressure, medication adherence, self-efficacy, stage of change, and blood pressure control among municipal workers with access to health insurance. Stage of change was a significant independent predictor of self-monitoring of blood pressure, but not blood pressure control. A strong relationship was found between medication adherence and medication adherence self-efficacy (r = .549, p < .05).Copyright 2012, SLACK Incorporated.

TI  - Prevalence of blood pressure self-monitoring, medication adherence, self-efficacy, stage of change, and blood pressure control among municipal workers with hypertension.
AB  - Despite the availability of effective medications, hypertension remains inadequately managed in the United States. It has been established that medication adherence is a major strategy for controlling blood pressure. Combined interventions to promote adherence are promising, but further research is needed to understand which behaviors to target. The frequency of self-monitoring of blood pressure among municipal workers is unknown, and the literature is limited regarding assessing individuals' readiness and confidence to engage in medication adherence. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of medication adherence, readiness, self-efficacy, self-monitoring of blood pressure, and blood pressure control among hypertensive municipal workers. The study population was enrolled in a wellness program established more than 20 years ago to promote health and safety for a work force in a large southeastern U.S. city. The majority of the study participants (75.7%) demonstrated controlled blood pressure, reported adherence to antihypertensive medication (70%), and self-monitored blood pressure (70%).Copyright 2012, SLACK Incorporated.

TI  - Reducing clinical inertia in hypertension treatment: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
AB  - Clinical inertia is a major contributor to poor blood pressure (BP) control. The authors tested the effectiveness of an intervention targeting physician, patient, and office system factors with regard to outcomes of clinical inertia and BP control. A total of 591 adult primary care patients with elevated BP (mean systolic BP > 140 mm Hg or mean diastolic BP > 90 mm Hg) were randomized to intervention or usual care. An outreach coordinator raised patient and provider awareness of unmet BP goals, arranged BP-focused primary care clinic visits, and furnished providers with treatment decision support. The intervention reduced clinical inertia (-29% vs -11%, P=.001). Nonetheless, change in BP did not differ between intervention and usual care (-10.1/-4.1 mm Hg vs -9.1/-4.5 mm Hg, P=.50 and 0.71 for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively). Future primary care-focused interventions might benefit from the use of specific medication titration protocols, treatment adherence support, and more sustained patient follow-up visits.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Adherence to placebo and mortality in the Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have reported lower mortality among patients who adhere to placebo compared with those who do not. We explored this phenomenon by reanalyzing data from the placebo arm of the Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of bucindolol and mortality.
AB  - AIMS: Our primary aim was to measure and explain the association between adherence to placebo and total mortality among the placebo-allocated participants in the BEST trial. Secondary aims included assessment of the association between placebo adherence and cause-specific mortality.
AB  - METHODS: Participants with "higher placebo adherence" were defined as having taken at least 75% of their placebo study medication over the entire course of each individual's participation in the study, while those with "lower placebo adherence" took <75%. Primary outcome was in-study all-cause mortality. To account for confounding, we adjusted for all available modifiable, non-modifiable and psychosocial variables.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherent participants had a significantly lower total mortality compared to less-adherent participants (HR=0.61, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.46-0.82). Adjusting for available confounders did not change the magnitude or significance of the estimates. When considering cause-specific mortality, CVD and pump failure showed similar associations.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of the BEST trial data support a strong association between adherence to placebo study medication and total mortality. While probably not due to publication bias or simple confounding by healthy lifestyle factors, the underlying explanation for the association remains a mystery. Prospective examination of this association is necessary to better understand the underlying mechanism of this observation.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Managing side effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy to optimize adherence in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia: the role of the midlevel practitioner.
AB  - In the last decade, the development of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has brought about unprecedented change in the way newly diagnosed, chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients are treated. Two next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, nilotinib and dasatinib, were initially indicated for imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia patients and recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of newly diagnosed, chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients. In comparison with the previous standards of care, benefits with these three tyrosine kinase inhibitors have included more rapid response rates, increased survival, and fewer side effects. The improved long-term outcomes have altered the approach to management of chronic myeloid leukemia from a progressive fatal disease with a poor prognosis to a chronic condition similar to diabetes or hypertension. Prolonged survival increases the need for patient education, support, monitoring, and assistance with adverse event management. Even low-grade side effects can adversely affect patients' quality of life and, therefore, require prompt attention to prevent long-term complications or suboptimal outcomes. New evidence has indicated that patient adherence to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is essential to successful treatment. Midlevel practitioners can help to optimize outcomes by educating patients regarding the importance of adherence, performing regular monitoring, helping patients to understand their test results, and aggressively managing treatment-related side effects.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Community Outreach and Cardiovascular Health (COACH) Trial: a randomized, controlled trial of nurse practitioner/community health worker cardiovascular disease risk reduction in urban community health centers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite well-publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, the implementation of risk-reducing practices remains poor. This report describes the results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a comprehensive program of cardiovascular disease risk reduction delivered by nurse practitioner /community health worker (NP/CHW) teams versus enhanced usual care (EUC) to improve lipids, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and patient perceptions of the quality of their chronic illness care in patients in urban community health centers.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 525 patients with documented cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension and levels of LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, or HbA1c that exceeded goals established by national guidelines were randomly assigned to NP/CHW (n=261) or EUC (n=264) groups. The NP/CHW intervention included aggressive pharmacological management and tailored educational and behavioral counseling for lifestyle modification and problem solving to address barriers to adherence and control. Compared with EUC, patients in the NP/CHW group had significantly greater 12-month improvement in total cholesterol (difference, 19.7 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (difference,15.9 mg/dL), triglycerides (difference, 16.3 mg/dL), systolic blood pressure (difference, 6.2 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (difference, 3.1 mm Hg), HbA1c (difference, 0.5%), and perceptions of the quality of their chronic illness care (difference, 1.2 points).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: An intervention delivered by an NP/CHW team using individualized treatment regimens based on treat-to-target algorithms can be an effective approach to improve risk factor status and perceptions of chronic illness care in high-risk patients.

TI  - Medication adherence among rural, low-income hypertensive adults: a randomized trial of a multimedia community-based intervention.
AB  - PURPOSE: Examine the effectiveness of a community-based, multimedia intervention on medication adherence among hypertensive adults.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Rural south Alabama.
AB  - SUBJECTS: Low-income adults (N  =  434) receiving medication at no charge from a public health department or a Federally Qualified Health Center.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Both interventions were home-based and delivered via computer by a community health advisor. The adherence promotion (AP) intervention focused on theoretical variables related to adherence (e.g., barriers, decisional balance, and role models). The cancer control condition received general cancer information.
AB  - MEASURES: Adherence was assessed by pill count. Other adherence-related variables, including barriers, self-efficacy, depression, and sociodemographic variables, were collected via a telephone survey.
AB  - ANALYSIS: Chi-square analysis tested the hypothesis that a greater proportion of participants in the AP intervention are >80% adherent compared to the control group. General linear modeling examined adherence as a continuous variable.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants receiving the intervention did not differ from individuals in the control group (51% vs. 49% adherent, respectively; p  =  .67). Clinic type predicted adherence (p < .0001), as did forgetting to take medications (p  =  .01) and difficulty getting to the clinic to obtain medications (p < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel interventions that focus on individual behavior and community-level targets (e.g., how health care is accessed and delivered) may be needed to improve medication adherence among low-income rural residents.

TI  - Impact of comorbidity type on measures of quality for diabetes care.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies provide conflicting results about the impact of comorbid conditions on the quality of chronic illness care. We assessed the effect of comorbidity type (concordant, discordant, or both) on the receipt of guideline-recommended care among patients with diabetes.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN: Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 condition groups: diabetes-concordant (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, hyperlipidemia), and/or diabetes-discordant (arthritis, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) conditions, or neither. We evaluated hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol readings at index and measured overall good quality of diabetes care, including a 6-month follow-up interval. We assessed the effect of condition group on overall good quality of care with logistic regression and generalized ordered logistic regression.
AB  - RESULTS: We assigned 35,872 patients to the diabetes comorbid condition groups, ranging from 2.0% in the discordant-only group to 58.0% in the concordant-only group. Patients with both types of conditions were more likely than those with no comorbidities to receive overall good quality for glycemic [odds ratio (OR), 2.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.86-2.41], blood pressure (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.40-1.84), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 3.08-4.05) control within 6 months of an index visit. They were also more likely to receive overall good quality for all 3 quality measures combined (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.96-2.39).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the greatest clinical complexity were more likely than less complex patients to receive high quality diabetes care, suggesting that increased complexity does not necessarily predispose chronically ill patients to receiving poorer care. However, caution should be used in treating certain patient groups, such as the elderly, for whom adherence to multiple condition-specific guidelines may lack benefit or cause harm.

TI  - The effect of minority status and rural residence on actions to control high blood pressure in the U.S.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined actions to control high blood pressure (HBP) and health-care provider recommendations for blood pressure control among adults by racial/ethnic group and rural/urban residence.
AB  - METHODS: We examined data from 45,024 participants with HBP in the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. We used multiple logistic regression analyses to assess the independent association between current actions to control HBP and health-care provider recommendations for blood pressure control by race/ethnicity and rural/urban status after accounting for confounders.
AB  - RESULTS: Black people, regardless of rural or urban residence, were more likely to report reducing salt and alcohol intake, changing eating habits, and taking medications than both white urban and white rural adults. Black people, regardless of rural or urban status, were more likely to be advised to cut down on salt, reduce alcohol use, and change eating habits. Black rural adults were also more likely to report being advised to take medications than white urban adults, while white rural adults were less likely to be advised to exercise than white urban adults.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Race/ethnicity and rural/urban status have a differential effect on actions to control HBP and provider advice to control HBP.

TI  - Multicenter cluster-randomized trial of a multifactorial intervention to improve antihypertensive medication adherence and blood pressure control among patients at high cardiovascular risk (the COM99 study).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence is common and results in preventable disease complications. This study assessed the effectiveness of a multifactorial intervention to improve both medication adherence and blood pressure control and to reduce cardiovascular events.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicenter, cluster-randomized trial, physicians from hospital-based hypertension clinics and primary care centers across Spain were randomized to receive and provide the intervention to their high-risk patients. Eligible patients were > 50 years of age, had uncontrolled hypertension, and had an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk greater than 30%. Physicians randomized to the intervention group counted patients' pills, designated a family member to support adherence behavior, and provided educational information to patients. The primary outcome was blood pressure control at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included both medication adherence and a composite end point of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. Seventy-nine physicians and 877 patients participated in the trial. The mean duration of follow-up was 39 months. Intervention patients were less likely to have an uncontrolled systolic blood pressure (odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.78) and were more likely to be adherent (odds ratio 1.91, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 3.05) than control group patients at 6 months. After 5 years, 16% of the patients in the intervention group and 19% in the control group met the composite end point (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.39).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifactorial intervention to improve adherence to antihypertensive medication was effective in improving both adherence and blood pressure control, but it did not appear to improve long-term cardiovascular events.

TI  - Understanding racial disparities in treatment intensification for hypertension management.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disparities in blood pressure (BP) control may be a function of disparities in treatment intensification (TI).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine racial differences in TI, understand modifiable factors that may mediate this relationship, and explore the relative effects of TI and race on blood pressure.
AB  - DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 819 black and white patients with hypertension from an urban, safety-net hospital
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: We sequentially explored the effects of patient race, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, beliefs about BP/medications, perceptions of provider/discrimination, sodium intake, medication adherence, and provider counseling on TI, performing a series of random effects analyses. To assess the effects of race and TI on BP, we performed linear regressions, using systolic BP (SBP) as the outcome.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Unadjusted analyses and those including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics revealed that black patients had less TI than whites (-0.31 vs.-0.24, p < 0.001), but adjustment for patient beliefs and experiences eliminated the effects of race (beta =-0.02, p = 0.5). Increased patient concerns about BP medications were related to lower TI, as was more provider counseling (beta =-0.06, p = 0.02 and beta = -0.01, p = 0.001, respectively). In the unadjusted analysis, black race was a significant predictor of SBP (134 mm/Hg for blacks vs. 131 mm/Hg for whites, p = 0.009), but when both race and TI were included in the model, TI was a significant predictor of SBP (final SBP 2.0 mm/Hg lower for each additional therapy increase per 10 visits, p < 0.001), while race was not (Blacks 1.6 mm/Hg higher than whites, p = 0.17).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Improved patient-provider communication targeted towards addressing patient concerns about medications may have the potential to reduce racial disparities in TI and ultimately, BP control.

TI  - Coronary heart disease in moderately hypercholesterolemic, hypertensive black and non-black patients randomized to pravastatin versus usual care: the antihypertensive and lipid lowering to prevent heart attack trial (ALLHAT-LLT).
AB  - BACKGROUND: In previous analyses in ALLHAT, blacks had a significantly lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the pravastatin group compared to the usual care group, whereas non-blacks had no benefit from pravastatin. No previous statin trial has reported results separately in blacks.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine if apparent racial differences in CHD in ALLHAT are explained by differences in baseline characteristics, adherence during the trial, or achieved blood pressure and lipid lowering.
AB  - METHODS: This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Hypertensive, moderately hypercholesterolemic participants were assigned to open-label pravastatin (40 mg/d) or usual care. The outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. We performed intention-to-treat survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for baseline covariates (age, sex, aspirin use, history of CHD and diabetes, and baseline hypertension treatment) and time-varying levels of blood pressure and total cholesterol.
AB  - RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline characteristics, there remained a significant interaction between race and treatment group (P = .02). In stratified models, blacks in the pravastatin group had a 29% lower risk of CHD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.90, P = .005) compared to those in the usual care group, whereas non-blacks had no benefit (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85-1.19, P = .95). With further adjustment for achieved blood pressure and total cholesterol, the HR in blacks was 0.65 (95% CI 0.45-0.96, P = .03) and in non-blacks was 1.07 (95% CI 0.81-1.41, P = .65).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pravastatin is effective in preventing CHD in blacks.

TI  - Cohort study of medication adherence in older adults (CoSMO): extended effects of Hurricane Katrina on medication adherence among older adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research indicates that many patients with hypertension ran out of medications and had difficulties getting refills immediately after Hurricane Katrina. The extended effect of Hurricane Katrina on antihypertensive medication adherence is not well characterized.
AB  - METHODS: Data were analyzed for 2194 participants who completed the baseline survey for the Cohort Study of Medication Adherence among Older Adults between August 2006 and September 2007. Based on pre-Katrina zip codes, the study population was categorized into high- and low-affected areas. Low medication adherence was defined as a score less than 6 on the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale.
AB  - RESULTS: Prevalence of low adherence was similar among participants living in high and low affected areas. Low medication adherence was similar for participants with greater than or less than 25% of the residence damaged by Hurricane Katrina and for participants with and without symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. In high affected areas, nonsignificant associations were present for those who had moved since the storm and those with a friend or immediate family member who had died in the month after the storm. These factors were not associated with low medication adherence in low affected areas. In both high- and low-affected areas, lower scores on the hurricane coping self-efficacy scale were associated with low medication adherence (P < 0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The effect of Hurricane Katrina on patient adherence to antihypertensive medication was limited in the second year after the storm. Intrinsic patient factors, such as low coping self-efficacy, remain important factors associated with low adherence.

TI  - Why don't diabetes patients achieve recommended risk factor targets? Poor adherence versus lack of treatment intensification.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of effective hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia therapies, target levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c), and hemoglobin A1c control are often not achieved.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relative importance of patient medication nonadherence versus clinician lack of therapy intensification in explaining above target cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor levels.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional assessment.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: In 2005, 161,697 Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult diabetes patients were included in the study.
AB  - MEASUREMENT: "Above target" was defined as most recent A1c >/=7.0% for hyperglycemia, LDL-c >/=100 mg/dL for hyperlipidemia, and SBP >/=130 mmHg for hypertension. Poor adherence was defined as medication gaps for >/=20% of days covered for all medications for each condition separately. Treatment intensification was defined as an increase in the number of drug classes, increased dosage of a class, or a switch to a different class within the 3 months before or after notation of above target levels.
AB  - RESULTS: Poor adherence was found in 20-23% of patients across the 3 conditions. No evidence of poor adherence with no treatment intensification was found in 30% of hyperglycemia patients, 47% of hyperlipidemia patients, and 36% of hypertension patients. Poor adherence or lack of therapy intensification was evident in 53-68% of patients above target levels across conditions.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Both nonadherence and lack of treatment intensification occur frequently in patients above target for CVD risk factor levels; however, lack of therapy intensification was somewhat more common. Quality improvement efforts should focus on these modifiable barriers to CVD risk factor control.

TI  - Psychometric properties of a short self-reported measure of medication adherence among patients with hypertension treated in a busy clinical setting in Korea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) among adults with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 373 adults with hypertension were given face-to-face interviews in 2 cardiology clinics at 2 large teaching hospitals in Seoul, South Korea. Blood pressure was measured twice, and medical records were reviewed. About one-third of the participants (n = 109) were randomly selected for a 2-week test-retest evaluation of reliability via telephone interview.
AB  - RESULTS: Internal consistency reliability was moderate (Cronbach alpha = 0.56), and test-retest reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation = 0.91; P < 0.001), although a ceiling effect was detected. The correlation of MMAS-8 scores with scores for the original 4-item scale indicated that convergent validity was good (r = 0.92; P < 0.01). A low MMAS-8 score was significantly associated with poor blood pressure control (chi(2) = 29.86; P < 0.001; adjusted odds ratio = 5.08; 95% CI, 2.56-10.08). Using a cut-off point of 6, sensitivity and specificity were 64.3% and 72.9%, respectively. Exploratory factor analysis identified 3 dimensions of the scale, with poor fit for the 1-dimensional construct using confirmatory factory analysis.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The MMAS-8 had satisfactory reliability and validity and thus might be suitable for assessment and counseling regarding medication adherence among adults with hypertension in a busy clinical setting in Korea.

TI  - Clinical inertia: a common barrier to changing provider prescribing behavior.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional content analysis nested within a randomized, controlled trial was conducted to collect information on provider responses to computer alerts regarding guideline recommendations for patients with suboptimal hypertension care.
AB  - METHODS: Participants were providers who cared for 1,017 patients with uncontrolled hypertension on a single antihypertensive agent within Veterans Affairs primary care clinics. All reasons for action or inaction were sorted into a framework to explain the variation in guideline adaptation.
AB  - RESULTS: The 184 negative provider responses to computer alerts contained explanations for not changing patient treatment; 76 responses to the alerts were positive, that is, the provider was going to make a change in antihypertensive regimen. The negative responses were categorized as: inertia of practice (66%), lack of agreement with specific guidelines (5%), patient-based factors (17%), environmental factors (10%), and lack of knowledge (2%). Most of the 135 providers classified as inertia of practice indicated, "Continue current medications and I will discuss at the next visit." The median number of days until the next visit was 45 days (interquartile range, 29 to 78 days).
AB  - DISCUSSION: Clinical inertia was the primary reason for failing to engage in otherwise indicated treatment change in a subgroup of patients. A framework was provided as a taxonomy for classification of provider barriers.

TI  - Effects of nebivolol on artery hypertension--multicentre study Bosnia and Herzegovina.
AB  - Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases; drugs that reduce blood pressure and simultaneously improve or reverse endothelian dysfunction, as nebivolol, may be advantageous in terms of cardiovascular protection. The objective of this study is to show the anti-hypertensive efficacy and safety of nebivolol (5 mg once a day) given to patients with arterial hypertension for 3 months. It should also provide information about drug's influence on laboratory tests--fasting blood glucose and serum cholesterol, triglyceride and creatinine concentrations. Six centers--Tuzla, Sarajevo, Mostar, Bihac, Zenica and Banja Luka participated in this prospective study with follow-up period of 3 months that included 3 visits. The study group consisted of 328 hypertensic patients. Results showed a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate at the end of the study. Fasting blood glucose level and serum cholesterol, triglyceride and creatinine changed significantly during the study, with lower levels of all the tests. Nebivolol seems to be free from some of the problems that generally accompany not only the classical beta- blockers but sometimes also newer classes of antihypertensive drugs. With its high anti-hypertensive efficiency and safety, and presence of statically significant difference in laboratory tests and beneficial effects, absence of adverse interaction with glucose and lipid metabolism, patients treated with Nebivolol may show an optimal adherence to therapy.

TI  - Multifaceted Prospective Memory Intervention to Improve Medication Adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test whether a multifaceted prospective memory intervention improved adherence to antihypertensive medications and to assess whether executive function and working memory processes moderated the intervention effects.
AB  - DESIGN: Two-group longitudinal randomized control trial.
AB  - SETTING: Community.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older without signs of dementia or symptoms of severe depression who were self-managing prescribed medication.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: After 4 weeks of initial adherence monitoring using a medication event monitoring system, individuals with 90% or less adherence were randomly assigned to groups.
AB  - INTERVENTION: The prospective memory intervention was designed to provide strategies that switch older adults from relying on executive function and working memory processes (that show effects of cognitive aging) to mostly automatic associative processes (that are relatively spared with normal aging) for remembering to take medications. Strategies included establishing a routine, establishing cues strongly associated with medication taking actions, performing the action immediately upon thinking about it, using a medication organizer, and imagining medication taking to enhance encoding and improve cuing.
AB  - RESULTS: There was significant improvement in adherence in the intervention group (57% at baseline to 78% after the intervention), but most of these gains were lost after 5 months. The control condition started at 68% and was stable during the intervention, but dropped to 62%. Executive function and working memory moderated the intervention effect, with the intervention producing greater benefit for those with lower executive function and working memory.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention improved adherence, but the benefits were not sustained. Further research is needed to determine how to sustain the substantial initial benefits.© 2016, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2016, The American Geriatrics Society.

TI  - Positive airway pressure improves nocturnal beat-to-beat blood pressure surges in obesity hypoventilation syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea.
AB  - Positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment has been shown to have a modest effect on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, there is a paucity of data on the effect of PAP therapy on rapid, yet significant, BP swings during sleep, particularly in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). The present study hypothesizes that PAP therapy will improve nocturnal BP on the first treatment night (titration PAP) in OHS patients with underlying OSA, and that these improvements will become more significant with 6 wk of PAP therapy. Seventeen adults (7 men, 10 women; age 50.4 +/- 10.7 years, BMI 49.3 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2)) with OHS and clinically diagnosed OSA participated in three overnight laboratory visits that included polysomnography and beat-to-beat BP monitoring via finger plethysmography. Six weeks of PAP therapy, but not titration PAP, lowered mean nocturnal BP. In contrast, when nocturnal beat-to-beat BPs were aggregated into bins consisting of at least three consecutive cardiac cycles with a >10 mmHg BP surge (i.e., DELTA10-20, DELTA20-30, DELTA30-40, and DELTA>40 mmHg), titration, and 6-wk PAP reduced the number of BP surges per hour (time x bin, P < 0.05). PAP adherence over the 6-wk period was significantly correlated to reductions in nocturnal systolic (r = 0.713, P = 0.001) and diastolic (r = 0.497, P = 0.043) BP surges. Despite these PAP-induced improvements in nocturnal beat-to-beat BP surges, 6 wk of PAP therapy did not alter daytime BP. In conclusion, PAP treatment reduces nocturnal beat-to-beat BP surges in OHS patients with underlying OSA, and this improvement in nocturnal BP regulation was greater in patients with higher PAP adherence.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

TI  - Mobile Phone Text Messages to Support Treatment Adherence in Adults With High Blood Pressure (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]): A Single-Blind, Randomized Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the effect of automated treatment adherence support delivered via mobile phone short message system (SMS) text messages on blood pressure.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: In this pragmatic, single-blind, 3-arm, randomized trial (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]) undertaken in South Africa, patients treated for high blood pressure were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to information only, interactive SMS text messaging, or usual care. The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure at 12 months from baseline measured with a validated oscillometric device. All trial staff were masked to treatment allocation. Analyses were intention to treat. Between June 26, 2012, and November 23, 2012, 1372 participants were randomized to receive information-only SMS text messages (n=457), interactive SMS text messages (n=458), or usual care (n=457). Primary outcome data were available for 1256 participants (92%). At 12 months, the mean adjusted change in systolic blood pressure compared with usual care was -2.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -4.4 to -0.04) with information-only SMS and -1.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -3.7 to 0.6) with interactive SMS. Odds ratios for the proportion of participants with a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg were 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.95) for information-only messaging and 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.95) for interactive messaging compared with usual care.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial of an automated adherence support program delivered by SMS text message in a general outpatient population of adults with high blood pressure, we found a small reduction in systolic blood pressure control compared with usual care at 12 months. There was no evidence that an interactive intervention increased this effect.

TI  - The FAITH Trial: Baseline Characteristics of a Church-based Trial to Improve Blood Pressure Control in Blacks.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the baseline characteristics of participants in the Faith-based Approaches in the Treatment of Hypertension (FAITH) Trial.
AB  - DESIGN: FAITH evaluates the effectiveness of a faith-based lifestyle intervention vs health education control on blood pressure (BP) reduction among hypertensive Black adults.
AB  - SETTING PARTICIPANTS AND MAIN MEASURES: Participants included 373 members of 32 Black churches in New York City. Baseline data collected included participant demographic characteristics, clinical measures (eg, blood pressure), behaviors (eg, diet, physical activity), and psychosocial factors (eg, self-efficacy, depressive symptoms).
AB  - RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 63.4 +/- 11.9 years and 76% were female. About half completed at least some college (53%), 66% had an income >$20,000, and 42.2% were retired or on disability. Participants had a mean systolic and diastolic BP of 152.1 +/- 16.8 mm Hg and 86.2 +/- 12.2 mm Hg, respectively, and a mean BMI of 32 kg/m2. Hypertension (HTN) medications were taken by 95% of participants, but most (79.1%) reported non-adherence to their regimen. Participants reported consuming 3.4 +/- 2.6 servings of fruits and vegetables and received 30.9% of their energy from fat. About one-third (35.9%) reported a low activity level.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the FAITH trial exhibited several adverse clinical and behavioral characteristics at baseline. Future analyses will evaluate the effectiveness of the faith-based lifestyle intervention on changes in BP and lifestyle behaviors among hypertensive Black adults.

TI  - A Multicomponent Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Stroke Risk Factor Behaviors: The Stroke Health and Risk Education Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Stroke Health and Risk Education Project was a cluster-randomized, faith-based, culturally sensitive, theory-based multicomponent behavioral intervention trial to reduce key stroke risk factor behaviors in Hispanics/Latinos and European Americans.
AB  - METHODS: Ten Catholic churches were randomized to intervention or control group. The intervention group received a 1-year multicomponent intervention (with poor adherence) that included self-help materials, tailored newsletters, and motivational interviewing counseling calls. Multilevel modeling, accounting for clustering within subject pairs and parishes, was used to test treatment differences in the average change since baseline (ascertained at 6 and 12 months) in dietary sodium, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity, measured using standardized questionnaires. A priori, the trial was considered successful if any one of the 3 outcomes was significant at the 0.05/3 level.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 801 subjects who consented, 760 completed baseline data assessments, and of these, 86% completed at least one outcome assessment. The median age was 53 years; 84% subjects were Hispanic/Latino; and 64% subjects were women. The intervention group had a greater increase in fruit and vegetable intake than the control group (0.25 cups per day [95% confidence interval: 0.08, 0.42], P=0.002), a greater decrease in sodium intake (-123.17 mg/d [-194.76, -51.59], P=0.04), but no difference in change in moderate- or greater-intensity physical activity (-27 metabolic equivalent-minutes per week [-526, 471], P=0.56).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This multicomponent behavioral intervention targeting stroke risk factors in predominantly Hispanics/Latinos was effective in increasing fruit and vegetable intake, reaching its primary end point. The intervention also seemed to lower sodium intake. Church-based health promotions can be successful in primary stroke prevention efforts.

TI  - A community-driven hypertension treatment group in rural Honduras.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We formed a self-funded hypertension treatment group in a resource-poor community in rural Honduras. After training community health workers and creating protocols for standardized treatment, we used group membership fees to maintain the group, purchase generic medications in bulk on the local market, and hire a physician to manage treatment. We then assessed whether participation in the group improved treatment, medication adherence, and hypertension control.
AB  - DESIGN: This is a program evaluation using quasi-experimental design and no control group. Using data from the 86 members of the hypertension treatment group, we analyzed baseline and follow-up surveys of members, along with 30 months of clinical records of treatment, medication adherence, and blood pressure readings.
AB  - RESULTS: Our initial hypertension needs assessment revealed that at baseline, community hypertensives relied on the local Ministry of Health clinic as their source of anti-hypertensive medications and reported that irregular supply interfered with medication adherence. At baseline, hypertension group members were mainly female, overweight or obese, physically active, non-smoking, and non-drinking. After 30 months of managing the treatment group, we found a significant increase in medication adherence, from 54.8 to 76.2% (p<0.01), and hypertension control (<140/90 mmHg), from 31.4 to 54.7% (p<0.01). We also found a mean monthly decrease of 0.39 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (p<0.01). At the end of the 30-month observation period, the local Ministry of Health system had increased provision of low-cost anti-hypertensive medications and adopted the hypertension treatment group's treatment protocols.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Formation of a self-funded, community-based hypertension treatment group in a rural, resource-poor community is feasible, and group participation may improve treatment, medication adherence, and hypertension control and can serve as a political driver for improving hypertension treatment services provided by the public system.

TI  - Baseline characteristics of African Americans in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.
AB  - The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) will compare treatment to a systolic blood pressure goal of <120 mm Hg to treatment to the currently recommended goal of <140 mm Hg for effects on incident cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic outcomes including cognitive decline. The objectives of this analysis are to compare baseline characteristics of African American (AA) and non-AA SPRINT participants and explore factors associated with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) by race. SPRINT enrolled 9361 hypertensive participants aged older than 50 years. This cross-sectional analysis examines sociodemographics, baseline characteristics, and study measures among AAs compared with non-AAs. AAs made up 31% of participants. AAs (compared with non-AAs) were younger and less frequently male, had less education, and were more likely uninsured or covered by Medicaid. In addition, AAs scored lower on the cognitive screening test when compared with non-AAs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found BP control rates to <140/90 mm Hg were higher for AAs who were male, had higher number of chronic diseases, were on diuretic treatment, and had better medication adherence. SPRINT is well poised to examine the effects of systolic blood pressure targets on clinical outcomes as well as predictors influencing BP control in AAs.

TI  - Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Lutein/Zeaxanthin, or Other Nutrient Supplementation on Cognitive Function: The AREDS2 Randomized Clinical Trial.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Observational data have suggested that high dietary intake of saturated fat and low intake of vegetables may be associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of oral supplementation with nutrients on cognitive function.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a double-masked randomized clinical trial (the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 [AREDS2]), retinal specialists in 82 US academic and community medical centers enrolled and observed participants who were at risk for developing late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) from October 2006 to December 2012. In addition to annual eye examinations, several validated cognitive function tests were administered via telephone by trained personnel at baseline and every 2 years during the 5-year study.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) (1 g) and/or lutein (10 mg)/zeaxanthin (2 mg) vs placebo were tested in a factorial design. All participants were also given varying combinations of vitamins C, E, beta carotene, and zinc.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the yearly change in composite scores determined from a battery of cognitive function tests from baseline. The analyses, which were adjusted for baseline age, sex, race, history of hypertension, education, cognitive score, and depression score, evaluated the differences in the composite score between the treated vs untreated groups. The composite score provided an overall score for the battery, ranging from -22 to 17, with higher scores representing better function.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 89% (3741/4203) of AREDS2 participants consented to the ancillary cognitive function study and 93.6% (3501/3741) underwent cognitive function testing. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 72.7 (7.7) years and 57.5% were women. There were no statistically significant differences in change of scores for participants randomized to receive supplements vs those who were not. The yearly change in the composite cognitive function score was -0.19 (99% CI, -0.25 to -0.13) for participants randomized to receive LCPUFAs vs -0.18 (99% CI, -0.24 to -0.12) for those randomized to no LCPUFAs (difference in yearly change, -0.03 [99% CI, -0.20 to 0.13]; P=.63). Similarly, the yearly change in the composite cognitive function score was -0.18 (99% CI, -0.24 to -0.11) for participants randomized to receive lutein/zeaxanthin vs -0.19 (99% CI, -0.25 to -0.13) for those randomized to not receive lutein/zeaxanthin (difference in yearly change, 0.03 [99% CI, -0.14 to 0.19]; P=.66). Analyses were also conducted to assess for potential interactions between LCPUFAs and lutein/zeaxanthin and none were found to be significant.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older persons with AMD, oral supplementation with LCPUFAs or lutein/zeaxanthin had no statistically significant effect on cognitive function.

TI  - Effects of a behavioral intervention that emphasizes spices and herbs on adherence to recommended sodium intake: results of the SPICE randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For decades, dietary sodium intake in the United States has remained high, and few studies have examined strategies for maintaining recommended intakes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of a behavioral intervention, which emphasized spices and herbs, on the maintenance of sodium intake at the recommended intake of 1500 mg/d in individuals to whom the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans apply.
AB  - DESIGN: We conducted a 2-phase study that included adults >18 y of age for whom Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends 1500 mg Na/d. The study was conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, from 2012 to 2014. In phase 1, 55 individuals consumed a low-sodium diet for 4 wk. Participants were provided all foods, snacks, and calorie-containing drinks. In phase 2, 40 participants from phase 1 were randomly assigned to either a behavioral intervention to reduce sodium intake (n = 20) or a self-directed control group (n = 20) for 20 wk. The primary study outcome was the change in mean 24-h urinary sodium excretion during phase 2. Linear regression analyses were used to determine intervention effects on urinary sodium excretion.
AB  - RESULTS: Participant characteristics were as follows: women: 65%; African American: 88%; hypertension: 63%; diabetes: 18%; mean age: 61 y; and mean body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 30. At the end of phase 2, mean 24-h sodium excretion was lower in the behavioral intervention than in the self-directed group (mean difference: -956.8 mg/d; 95% CI: -1538.7, -374.9 mg/d) after sodium intake at screening was controlled for (P = 0.002). These findings persisted in sensitivity analyses that excluded potentially incomplete urine collections [Mage's equation mean difference: -1090 mg/d (P = 0.001); Joosens' equation mean difference: -796 mg/d (P = 0.04)].
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifactorial behavioral intervention emphasizing spices and herbs significantly reduced sodium intake. Because of the ubiquity of sodium in the US food supply, multilevel strategies addressing individual behaviors and the food supply are needed to improve adherence to recommendations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01615159.Copyright © 2015 American Society for Nutrition.

TI  - Monotherapy versus dual therapy for the initial treatment of hypertension (PATHWAY-1): a randomised double-blind controlled trial.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have suggested that more intensive initial therapy for hypertension results in better long-term blood pressure (BP) control. We test this hypothesis comparing initial monotherapy with dual therapy in the management of essential hypertension.
AB  - METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled trial in patients with essential hypertension. Around 50% of patients studied will be newly diagnosed and the others will be known hypertensives who previously received only monotherapy. The trial is divided into three phases as follows: Phase 1 (Week 0-Week 16): Randomised, parallel-group, masked assignation to either combination or monotherapy. Phase 2 (Week 17-Week 32): Open-label combination therapy. Phase 3 (Week 33-Week 52): Open-label combination therapy plus open-label add-on (if BP is above 140/90 mm Hg). Hierarchical primary end points are: a comparison of home BP (home systolic blood pressure (HSBP)) averaged over the duration of phase 1 and 2 in the combination versus monotherapy arms. If combination is superior in this analysis, then the averaged mean HSBP between initial monotherapy and initial combination therapy at the end of phase 2 will be compared. Secondary end points include: BP control at 1 year; the role of age, baseline renin, sodium status, plasma volume, haemodynamic compensation and peripheral resistance on BP control; validation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence/British Hypertension Society joint guideline algorithm; safety and tolerability of combination therapy; and the impact of combination versus monotherapy on left ventricular mass and aortic pulse wave velocity. A sample size of 536 (268 in each group) will have 90% power to detect a difference in means of 4 mm Hg.
AB  - ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: PATHWAY 1 was approved by UK ethics (REC Reference 09/H0308/132). Trial results will be published and all participating subjects will be informed of the results.

TI  - The Cost-Effectiveness of Low-Cost Essential Antihypertensive Medicines for Hypertension Control in China: A Modelling Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is China's leading cardiovascular disease risk factor. Improved hypertension control in China would result in result in enormous health gains in the world's largest population. A computer simulation model projected the cost-effectiveness of hypertension treatment in Chinese adults, assuming a range of essential medicines list drug costs.
AB  - METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-China, a Markov-style computer simulation model, simulated hypertension screening, essential medicines program implementation, hypertension control program administration, drug treatment and monitoring costs, disease-related costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by preventing cardiovascular disease or lost because of drug side effects in untreated hypertensive adults aged 35-84 y over 2015-2025. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in cardiovascular disease patients (secondary prevention) and for two blood pressure ranges in primary prevention (stage one, 140-159/90-99 mm Hg; stage two, >160/>100 mm Hg). Treatment of isolated systolic hypertension and combined systolic and diastolic hypertension were modeled as a reduction in systolic blood pressure; treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension was modeled as a reduction in diastolic blood pressure. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored ranges of antihypertensive drug effectiveness and costs, monitoring frequency, medication adherence, side effect severity, background hypertension prevalence, antihypertensive medication treatment, case fatality, incidence and prevalence, and cardiovascular disease treatment costs. Median antihypertensive costs from Shanghai and Yunnan province were entered into the model in order to estimate the effects of very low and high drug prices. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than the per capita gross domestic product of China (11,900 international dollars [Int$] in 2015) were considered cost-effective. Treating hypertensive adults with prior cardiovascular disease for secondary prevention was projected to be cost saving in the main simulation and 100% of probabilistic simulation results. Treating all hypertension for primary and secondary prevention would prevent about 800,000 cardiovascular disease events annually (95% uncertainty interval, 0.6 to 1.0 million) and was borderline cost-effective incremental to treating only cardiovascular disease and stage two patients (2015 Int$13,000 per QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval, Int$10,000 to Int$18,000]). Of all one-way sensitivity analyses, assuming adherence to taking medications as low as 25%, high Shanghai drug costs, or low medication efficacy led to the most unfavorable results (treating all hypertension, about Int$47,000, Int$37,000, and Int$27,000 per QALY were gained, respectively). The strengths of this study were the use of a recent Chinese national health survey, vital statistics, health care costs, and cohort study outcomes data as model inputs and reliance on clinical-trial-based estimates of coronary heart disease and stroke risk reduction due to antihypertensive medication treatment. The limitations of the study were the use of several sources of data, limited clinical trial evidence for medication effectiveness and harms in the youngest and oldest age groups, lack of information about geographic and ethnic subgroups, lack of specific information about indirect costs borne by patients, and uncertainty about the future epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases in China.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Expanded hypertension treatment has the potential to prevent about 800,000 cardiovascular disease events annually and be borderline cost-effective in China, provided low-cost essential antihypertensive medicines programs can be implemented.

TI  - Medication adherence and visit-to-visit variability of systolic blood pressure in African Americans with chronic kidney disease in the AASK trial.
AB  - Lower adherence to antihypertensive medications may increase visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure (VVV of BP), a risk factor for cardiovascular events and death. We used data from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) trial to examine whether lower medication adherence is associated with higher systolic VVV of BP in African Americans with hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Determinants of VVV of BP were also explored. AASK participants (n=988) were categorized by self-report or pill count as having perfect (100%), moderately high (75-99%), moderately low (50-74%) or low (<50%) proportion of study visits with high medication adherence over a 1-year follow-up period. We used multinomial logistic regression to examine determinants of medication adherence, and multivariable-adjusted linear regression to examine the association between medication adherence and systolic VVV of BP, defined as the coefficient of variation or the average real variability (ARV). Participants with lower self-reported adherence were generally younger and had a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions. Compared with perfect adherence, moderately high, moderately low and low adherence was associated with 0.65% (+/-0.31%), 0.99% (+/-0.31%) and 1.29% (+/-0.32%) higher systolic VVV of BP (defined as the coefficient of variation) in fully adjusted models. Results were qualitatively similar when using ARV or when using pill counts as the measure of adherence. Lower medication adherence is associated with higher systolic VVV of BP in African Americans with hypertensive CKD; efforts to improve medication adherence in this population may reduce systolic VVV of BP.

TI  - Patient and professional user experiences of simple telehealth for hypertension, medication reminders and smoking cessation: a service evaluation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To establish patient and professional user satisfaction with the Advice & Interactive Messaging (AIM) for Health programme delivered using a mobile phone-based, simple telehealth intervention, 'Florence'.
AB  - DESIGN: A service evaluation using data extracted from Florence and from a professional user electronic survey.
AB  - SETTING: 425 primary care practices across 31 Clinical Commissioning Groups in England.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 3381 patients registered on 1 of 10 AIM protocols between March 2013 and January 2014 and 77 professional users.
AB  - INTERVENTION: The AIM programme offered 10 clinical protocols, in three broad groups: (1) hypertension diagnosis/monitoring, (2) medication reminders and (3) smoking cessation. Florence sent patients prompts to submit clinical information, educational messages and user satisfaction questions. Patient responses were reviewed by their primary healthcare providers.
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients and professional user experiences of using AIM, and within this, Florence.
AB  - RESULTS: Patient activity using Florence was generally good at month 1 for the hypertension protocols (71-80%), but reduced over 2-3 months (31-60%). For the other protocols, patient activity was 0-39% at 3 months. Minimum target days of texting were met for half the hypertension protocols. 1707/2304 (74%) patients sent evaluative texts responded at least once. Among responders, agreement with the adapted friends and family statement generally exceeded preproject aspirations. Professional responders were generally positive or equivocal about the programme.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with AIM appeared optimal when patients were carefully selected for the protocol; professional users were familiar with the system, the programme addressed a problem with the previous service delivery that was identified by users and users took an active approach to achieve clinical goals. However, there was a significant decrease in patients' use of Florence over time. Future applications may be optimised by identifying and addressing reasons for the waning use of the service and enhancing support during implementation of the service.Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

TI  - Case Study: Community Engagement and Clinical Trial Success: Outreach to African American Women.
AB  - This brief report examines how the use of community engagement principles and approaches enhanced clinical trial recruitment and retention. The Community-Engaged Research Core (CERC), a CTSA-supported resource designed to facilitate community involvement in clinical and translational research, was consulted to provide assistance with the implementation of the clinical trial, and specifically to enhance participation of the target population-African American women. CERC's key recommendations included: (1) convene a Community Engagement Studio, (2) redesign the recruitment advertisement, (3) simplify the language used to explain the scope of the study, and (4) provide transportation for participants. As a result of these interventions, a comprehensive strategy to recruit, enroll, and retain participants was formulated. After implementation of the plan by the study team, enrollment increased 78% and recruitment goals were met 16 months ahead of schedule. Participant retention and study drug adherence was 100%. We conclude that community engagement is essential to the development of an effective multifaceted plan to improve recruitment of underrepresented groups in clinical trials.

TI  - Performance and persistence of a blood pressure self-management intervention: telemonitoring and self-management in hypertension (TASMINH2) trial.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate, in detail, the implementation of the self-management intervention used in the TASMINH2 trial. The intervention, comprising self-monitoring for the first week of each month and an individualised treatment self-titration schedule, was developed from a previous trial of self-management. Two hundred and sixty-three patients with poorly controlled but treated hypertension were randomised to receive this intervention and underwent training over two or three sessions. Participants were followed up for 12 months during which time process data were collected regarding the persistence and fidelity of actual behaviour compared with intervention recommendations. Two hundred and forty-one (92%) patients completed training of whom 188 (72%) self-managed their BP and completed at least 90% of expected self-monitoring measurements for the full year of the study. Overall, 268/483 (55%) of recommended medication changes were implemented. Only 25 (13%) patients had controlled BP throughout the year and so were not recommended any medication changes. Adherence to the protocol reduced over time as the number of potential changes increased. Of those self-managing throughout, 131 (70%) made at least one medication change, with 77 (41%) implementing all their recommended changes. In conclusion, self-management of hypertension was possible in practice with most participants making at least one medication change. Although adherence to the intervention reduced over time, implementation of treatment recommendations appeared better than equivalent trials using physician titration. Future self-management interventions should aim to better support patients' decision making, perhaps through enhanced use of technology.

TI  - Knowledge and adherence to antihypertensive therapy in primary care: results of a randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of a healthcare education program for patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, cluster-randomized trial was conducted. Randomization was by primary care center; 18 of 36 urban primary care centers in Barcelona and its metropolitan area were randomized to the intervention group (IG) and 18 to the control group (CG). The study sample consisted of patients with hypertension (n=996; 515 in the IG and 481 in the CG) receiving outpatient treatment with antihypertensive drugs. The intervention consisted of personalized information by a trained nurse and written leaflets. Questionnaires on knowledge and awareness of hypertension and its medication, treatment adherence, healthy lifestyle habits, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index were assessed at each visit, with a 12-month follow-up. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied.
AB  - RESULTS: Knowledge of hypertension increased by 27.8% in the IG and by 18.5% in the CG, while that of medication increased by 10.1% in the IG and 5.5% in the CG. Treatment adherence measured by the Morisky-Green test increased by 9.6% (95% CI: 5.5-13.6) in the IG and 8.8% (95% CI: 4.9-12.6) in the CG. There were no differences in adherence on the other tests used. No differences were observed between the IG and CG in clinical variables such as blood pressure or BMI at the end of the trial.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The educational intervention had no significant impact on patients' adherence to the medication.Copyright © 2010 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine therapeutic compliance when brand name amlodipine and simvastatin are substituted for generic drugs, and to determine patients' and physicians' opinions of this substitution.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed an observational study with a control group, based on a review of the medical records in six primary care centers. Participants consisted of patients > 40 years old initiating treatment with a brand name drug (initial period), which was later substituted by a generic drug (final period). The study subgroups consisted of patients with hypertension (amlodipine) or dyslipidemia (simvastatin). The main measures were comorbidity, compliance, treatment length, biochemistry determinations, and patients' and physicians' opinions (interviews). All patients received a brand name drug for a minimum of 1 year followed by a generic drug for a minimum of 1 year (minimum continuation/patient: 24 months).
AB  - RESULTS: There were 1,252 patients (groups: 49.5% amlodipine; 50.5% simvastatin). Patients treated with amlodipine (period comparison) showed better compliance (65.8 vs. 61.3%; p=0.037) and blood pressure control (48.5 vs. 45.8%; p=0.039) with the brand name drug. The percentages with simvastatin were 62.8 vs. 58.4% (p=0.041), respectively. A total of 73.6% of the physicians interviewed prescribed generic drugs and 59.2% believed that both types of drug had the same efficacy. Most of the patients interviewed (79.8%; CI: 74.3-85.3%) accepted the substitution; 55.3% (CI: 48.5-62.1%) received the appropriate information but 61.5% were confused by the different products. Lack of compliance was reported by 18.2%.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In patients receiving amlodipine or simvastatin, compliance decreased with time, independently of the change from a band name to a generic drug.Copyright © 2010 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana. All rights reserved.

TI  - Failure of Internet-based audit and feedback to improve quality of care delivered by primary care residents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of Internet-based audit and feedback to physicians to improve care for diabetes and hypertension.
AB  - DESIGN: Time-series analysis of an intervention.
AB  - METHODS: The study setting was Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, a 14-site multispecialty group in greater Boston. The study period was July 1997-June 1999.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: were 12 primary care internal medicine residents who provided care to adult patients with diabetes (n = 76 pre-intervention and n = 88 post-intervention), hypertension (n = 329 pre-intervention and n = 338 post-intervention), or both (n = 62 pre-intervention and n = 71 post-intervention). We determined the proportion of each resident's patients whose care fulfilled national guidelines for quality (i.e. diabetes patients had hemoglobin testing in the previous 6 months or hypertension patients received a beta-blocker or diuretic in the same time period). After meeting individually with each resident to obtain informed consent and to encourage participation, we sent each resident information for accessing his or her practice profile on a secure website. The main outcome measures were (i) the proportion of resident physicians who accessed their profiles and (ii) change following the intervention in the proportion of patients whose care followed national guidelines.
AB  - RESULTS: Over a 1-year period, only four of the 12 residents accessed their websites. One of the residents visited her site three times, while the other three residents visited their sites once each. In interrupted time-series analyses, the intervention had no discernible effect on adherence to practice guidelines for diabetes or hypertension.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The lack of participation in this Internet-based intervention may have important implications for the development of future programs that require physicians to interact with technology to improve quality of care.

TI  - Application of global positioning system methods for the study of obesity and hypertension risk among low-income housing residents in New York City: a spatial feasibility study.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using global positioning system (GPS) methods to understand the spatial context of obesity and hypertension risk among a sample of low-income housing residents in New York City (n = 120). GPS feasibility among participants was measured with a pre- and post-survey as well as adherence to a protocol which included returning the GPS device as well as objective data analysed from the GPS devices. We also conducted qualitative interviews with 21 of the participants. Most of the sample was overweight (26.7%) or obese (40.0%). Almost one-third (30.8%) was pre-hypertensive and 39.2% was hypertensive. Participants reported high ratings of GPS acceptability, ease of use and low levels of wear-related concerns in addition to few concerns related to safety, loss or appearance, which were maintained after the baseline GPS feasibility data collection. Results show that GPS feasibility increased over time. The overall GPS return rate was 95.6%. Out of the total of 114 participants with GPS, 112 (98.2%) delivered at least one hour of GPS data for one day and 84 (73.7%) delivered at least one hour on 7 or more days. The qualitative interviews indicated that overall, participants enjoyed wearing the GPS devices, that they were easy to use and charge and that they generally forgot about the GPS device when wearing it daily. Findings demonstrate that GPS devices may be used in spatial epidemiology research in low-income and potentially other key vulnerable populations to understand geospatial determinants of obesity, hypertension and other diseases that these populations disproportionately experience.

TI  - Understanding disparities in lipid management among patients with type 2 diabetes: gender differences in medication nonadherence after treatment intensification.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gender differences in dyslipidemia are widely documented, but the contributors to these differences are not well understood. This study examines whether differences in quality of care, intensity of lipid-lowering medication regimen, and medication adherence can explain this disparity.
AB  - METHODS: Secondary analysis of medical records data and questionnaires collected from adult patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 1,369) from seven outpatient clinics affiliated with an academic medical center as part of the Reducing Racial Disparities in Diabetes: Coached Care (R2D2C2) study. Primary outcome was low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
AB  - FINDINGS: Women had higher LDL cholesterol levels than men (mean [SD], 101.2 [35.2] vs. 92.3 [33.0] mg/dL; p < .001), but were no less likely to receive recommended processes of diabetes care, to attain targets for glycemic control and blood pressure, or to be on intensive medication regimens. More women than men reported medication nonadherence related to cost (32.7% vs. 24.2%; p = .040) and related to side effects (47.2% vs. 36.8%; p = .024). For all patients, regimen intensity (p < .05) and nonadherence related to side effects (p < .01) were each associated with higher LDL cholesterol levels. The addition of a new lipid-lowering agent was associated with subsequent nonadherence related to side effects for women (p < .001), but not for men (p = .45; test for interaction p = .048).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Despite comparable quality of diabetes care and regimen intensity for lipid management, women with diabetes experienced poorer lipid control than men. Medication nonadherence seemed to be a major contributor to dyslipidemia, particularly for women because of side effects associated with intensifying the lipid-lowering regimen.Copyright © 2015 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.

TI  - Rationale and design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating community health worker-based interventions for the secondary prevention of acute coronary syndromes in India (SPREAD).
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need to evaluate and implement cost-effective strategies to improve adherence to treatments in coronary heart disease. There are no studies from low- to middle income countries (LMICs) evaluating trained community health worker (CHW)-based interventions for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.
AB  - METHODS: We designed a hospital-based, open randomized trial of CHW-based interventions versus standard care. Patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were randomized to an intervention group (a CHW-based intervention package, comprising education tools to enhance self-care and adherence, and regular follow-up by the CHW) or to standard care for 12 months during which study outcomes were recorded. The CHWs were trained over a period of 6 months. The primary outcome measure was medication adherence. The secondary outcomes were differences in adherence to lifestyle modification, physiological parameters (blood pressure [BP], body weight, body mass index [BMI], heart rate, lipids), and major adverse cardiovascular events.
AB  - RESULTS: We recruited 806 patients stabilized after an ACS from 14 hospitals in 13 Indian cities. The mean age was 56.4 (+/- 11.32) years, and 17.2% were females. A high prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension (43.4%), diabetes (31.9%), tobacco consumption (35.4%), and inadequate physical activity (70.5%) was documented. A little over half had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (53.7%), and 46.3% had non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The CHW interventions and training for SPREAD have been developed and adapted for local use. The results and experience of this study will be important to counter the burden of cardiovascular diseases in low- to middle income countries.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Facilitators of and Barriers to Adherence to Hypertension Treatment Scale.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of adherence to recommended regimens is a major cause of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) among African/Black American (AA) women. The national initiative to increase BP control among AAs by 50% makes clear the need for culturally appropriate instruments to assess facilitators of adherence to treatment of hypertension (high BP [HBP]).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a culturally sensitive measure of facilitators of and barriers to adherence to hypertension treatment regimens for AA women.
AB  - METHODS: We developed the Facilitators of and Barriers to Adherence to Hypertension Treatment Scale (FATS) with input from focus groups with 20 AA women. A total of 147 AA women from a federally funded inner-city clinic in Los Angeles were enrolled in the study and 70 (48%) completed the survey. Internal consistency reliability was estimated using Cronbach's alpha.
AB  - RESULTS: Coefficient alpha for the 18-item FATS was 78. In a multivariate regression model, controlling for BP stage, the FATS was significantly associated with the Hill-Bone High Blood Pressure Compliance Scale (standardized beta = .35; P = .0014), the Enhancing Recovery From Coronary Heart Disease Social Support Inventory (beta = .42; P = .001), the and CAGE (cut down on your drinking, annoyed by being criticized for your drinking, guilty about drinking, and eye-opener drink in the morning) alcohol screening instrument (beta = -.24; P = .05).
AB  - DISCUSSION: The FATS is a culturally sensitive measure for assessing adherence to treatment regimens of HBP in AA women. Further study in other samples of AA women is needed to confirm that the FATS adequately assesses facilitators of adherence to regimens for HBP in AA women.

TI  - Reinforcing adherence to antihypertensive medications.
AB  - This pilot study evaluated a reinforcement intervention to improve adherence to antihypertensive therapy. Twenty-nine participants were randomized to standard care or standard care plus financial reinforcement for 12 weeks. Participants in the reinforcement group received a cell phone to self-record videos of adherence, for which they earned rewards. These participants sent videos demonstrating on-time adherence 97.8% of the time. Pill count adherence differed significantly between the groups during treatment, with 98.8%+/-1.5% of pills taken during treatment in the reinforcement condition vs 92.6%+/-9.2% in standard care (P<.002). Benefits persisted throughout a 3-month follow-up, with 93.8%+/-9.3% vs 78.0%+/-18.5% of pills taken (P<.001). Pill counts correlated significantly (P<.001) with self-reports of adherence, which also differed between groups over time (P<.01). Systolic blood pressure decreased modestly over time in participants overall (P<.01) but without significant time-by-group effects. These results suggest that reinforcing medication adherence via cellular phone technology and financial reinforcement holds potential to improve adherence.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Medication non-adherence after myocardial infarction: an exploration of modifying factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication non-adherence is a major impediment to the management of cardiovascular disease risk factors. A better understanding of the modifying factors underlying medication non-adherence among individuals with known cardiovascular disease may inform approaches for addressing non-adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify demographic and patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, psychosocial factors, and health belief-related factors associated with medication non-adherence among patients with known cardiovascular disease.
AB  - DESIGN: We performed secondary analysis of baseline data from a randomized trial.
AB  - PATIENTS: The study included 405 patients with a diagnosis of hypertension and history of acute myocardial infarction that was diagnosed within a three-year period prior to enrollment.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Baseline demographics and patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, psychosocial factors, health belief-related factors, and patient-reported medication non-adherence were analyzed.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Of 405 patients, 173 (42.7 %) reported medication non-adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence in bivariate analysis included younger age, non-white race, having less than 12 years of education, smoking, financial insecurity, identifying as nervous or tense, higher life chaos score, greater worry about having a myocardial infarction, and greater worry about having a stroke. Using multivariable modeling, we determined that age (OR 0.97 per additional year, 95 % CI, 0.95-0.99), life chaos (OR 1.06 per additional point, 95 % CI, 1.00-1.11), and worry about stroke (OR 1.12 per additional point, 95 % CI, 1.01-1.25) remained significantly associated with self-reported medication non-adherence.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We found that worry about having a stroke, higher life chaos, and younger age were all significantly associated with self-reported medication non-adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease and a history of myocardial infarction. Further research exploring these factors as targets for intervention is needed, as is additional research examining modifiable causes of medication non-adherence among patients with cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Impact of a community health workers-led structured program on blood glucose control among latinos with type 2 diabetes: the DIALBEST trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Latinos with type 2 diabetes (T2D) face major healthcare access and disease management disparities. We examined the impact of the Diabetes Among Latinos Best Practices Trial (DIALBEST), a community health worker (CHW)-led structured intervention for improving glycemic control among Latinos with T2D.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 211 adult Latinos with poorly controlled T2D were randomly assigned to a standard of healthcare (n = 106) or CHW (n = 105) group. The CHW intervention comprised 17 individual sessions delivered at home by CHWs over a 12-month period. Sessions addressed T2D complications, healthy lifestyles, nutrition, healthy food choices and diet for diabetes, blood glucose self-monitoring, and medication adherence. Demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, anthropometric, and biomarker (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profile) data were collected at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months (6 months postintervention). Groups were equivalent at baseline.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants had high HbA1c at baseline (mean 9.58% [81.2 mmol/mol]). Relative to participants in the control group, CHWs had a positive impact on net HbA1c improvements at 3 months (-0.42% [-4.62 mmol/mol]), 6 months (-0.47% [-5.10 mmol/mol]), 12 months (-0.57% [-6.18 mmol/mol]), and 18 months (-0.55% [-6.01 mmol/mol]). The overall repeated-measures group effect was statistically significant (mean difference -0.51% [-5.57 mmol/mol], 95% CI -0.83, -0.19% [-9.11, -2.03 mmol/mol], P = 0.002). CHWs had an overall significant effect on fasting glucose concentration that was more pronounced at the 12- and 18-month visits. There was no significant effect on blood lipid levels, hypertension, and weight.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: DIALBEST is an effective intervention for improving blood glucose control among Latinos with T2D.Copyright © 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

TI  - Effect of a low-fat or low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet on markers of cardiovascular risk among premenopausal women: a randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-fat and low-carbohydrate weight-loss diets can have a beneficial effect on longitudinal measures of blood pressure and blood lipids. We aimed to assess longitudinal changes in blood pressure and blood lipids in a population of premenopausal women. We hypothesized that results may differ by level of adherence to the respective diet protocol and baseline presence of hypertension or hyperlipidemia.
AB  - METHODS: Overweight or obese premenopausal women were randomized to a low-fat (n=41) or low-carbohydrate (n=38) diet. As part of the 52-week Lifestyle Eating and Fitness (LEAF) intervention trial, we fit linear mixed models to determine whether a change in outcome differed by treatment arm.
AB  - RESULTS: Within-group trends in blood pressure and blood lipids did not differ (p>0.30). Across study arms, there was a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP, 3mm Hg, p=0.01) over time, but diastolic blood pressure (DBP) did not change significantly over the course of the study. Blood lipids (total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoproteins [LDL], and high-density lipoproteins [HDL]) all exhibited nonlinear trends over time (p<0.01); each decreased initially but returned to levels comparable to baseline by study conclusion (p>0.20). We observed a decline in SBP among women who were hypertensive at baseline (p<0.01), but hypercholesterolemia at baseline did not affect trends in blood lipids (p>0.40).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that dietary interventions may be efficacious for lowering blood pressure and blood lipids among overweight or obese premenopausal women. However, a decrease in SBP was the only favorable change that was sustained in this study population. These changes can be maintained over the course of a 1-year intervention, yet changes in blood lipids may be less sustainable.

TI  - The Utah Remote Monitoring Project: improving health care one patient at a time.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The expanding role of technology to augment diabetes care and management highlights the need for clinicians to learn about these new tools. As these tools continue to evolve and enhance improved outcomes, it is imperative that clinicians consider the role of telemonitoring, or remote monitoring, in patient care. This article describes a successful telemonitoring project in Utah.
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a nonrandomized prospective observational preintervention-postintervention study, using a convenience sample. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes and/or hypertension from four rural and two urban primary care clinics and one urban stroke center participated in a telemonitoring program. The primary clinical outcome measures were changes in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and blood pressure. Other outcomes included fasting lipids, weight, patient engagement, diabetes knowledge, hypertension knowledge, medication adherence, and patient perceptions of the usefulness of the telemonitoring program.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean A1C decreased from 9.73% at baseline to 7.81% at the end of the program (P<0.0001). Systolic blood pressure also declined significantly, from 130.7 mm Hg at baseline to 122.9 mm Hg at the end (P=0.0001). Low-density lipoprotein content decreased significantly, from 103.9 mg/dL at baseline to 93.7 mg/dL at the end (P=0.0263). Other clinical parameters improved nonsignificantly. Knowledge of diabetes and hypertension increased significantly (P<0.001 for both). Patient engagement and medication adherence also improved, but not significantly. Per questionnaires at study end, patients felt the telemonitoring program was useful.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring improved clinical outcomes and may be a useful tool to help enhance disease management and care of patients with diabetes and/or hypertension.

TI  - Participant adherence indicators predict changes in blood pressure, anthropometric measures, and self-reported physical activity in a lifestyle intervention: HUB city steps.
AB  - The objective of this secondary analysis was to evaluate the utility of several participant adherence indicators for predicting changes in clinical, anthropometric, dietary, fitness, and physical activity (PA) outcomes in a lifestyle intervention, HUB City Steps, conducted in a southern, African American cohort in 2010. HUB City Steps was a 6-month, community-engaged, multicomponent, noncontrolled intervention targeting hypertension risk factors. Descriptive indicators were constructed using two participant adherence measures, education session attendance (ESA) and weekly steps/day pedometer diary submission (PDS), separately and in combination. Analyses, based on data from 269 primarily African American adult participants, included bivariate tests of association and multivariable linear regression to determine significant relationships between seven adherence indicators and health outcome changes, including clinical, anthropometric, dietary, fitness, and PA measures. ESA indicators were significantly correlated with four health outcomes: body mass index (BMI), fat mass, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and PA (-.29 < r < .23, p < .05). PDS indicators were significantly correlated with PA (r = .27, p < .001). Combination ESA/PDS indicators were significantly correlated with five health outcomes: BMI, percentage body fat (%BF), fat mass, LDL, and PA (r = -.26 to .29, p < .05). Results from the multivariate models indicated that the combination ESA/PDS indicators were the most significant predictors of changes for five outcomes--%BF, fat mass, LDL diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PA--while ESA performed best for BMI only. For DBP, a one-unit increase in the continuous-categorical ESA/PDS indicator resulted in 0.3 mm Hg decrease. Implications for assessing participant adherence in community-based, multicomponent lifestyle intervention research are discussed.Copyright © 2014 Society for Public Health Education.

TI  - Comprehensive approach for hypertension control in low-income populations: rationale and study design for the hypertension control program in Argentina. [Review]
AB  - Although the efficacy and effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive pharmaceutical treatment for the prevention and control of hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular disease have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, this scientific knowledge has not been fully applied in the general population, especially in low-income communities. This article summarizes interventions to improve hypertension management and describes the rationale and study design for a cluster randomized trial testing whether a comprehensive intervention program within a national public primary care system will improve hypertension control among uninsured hypertensive men and women and their families. We will recruit 1,890 adults from 18 clinics within a public primary care network in Argentina. Clinic patients with uncontrolled hypertension, their spouses and hypertensive family members will be enrolled. The comprehensive intervention program targets the primary care system through health care provider education, a home-based intervention among patients and their families (home delivery of antihypertensive medication, self-monitoring of blood pressure [BP], health education for medication adherence and lifestyle modification) conducted by community health workers and a mobile health intervention. The primary outcome is net change in systolic BP from baseline to month 18 between intervention and control groups among hypertensive study participants. The secondary outcomes are net change in diastolic BP, BP control and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. This study will generate urgently needed data on effective, practical and sustainable intervention programs aimed at controlling hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular disease in underserved populations in low- and middle-income countries.

TI  - Relationships among stressful life events and physiological markers, treatment adherence, and psychosocial functioning among youth with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships between stressful life events and physiological measures, adherence to prescribed oral medication regimens, depressive symptoms, and impaired quality of life (QoL) in adolescents with recent-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D).
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected from 497 ethnically diverse participants (66% female) in the final year of the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth multicenter clinical trial. Exposure to 32 possible events over the previous year and rating of subsequent distress were collected by self-report and summarized as a major stressors score. This score was analyzed for relationship to glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c and treatment failure), body mass index, diagnosis of hypertension or triglyceride dyslipidemia, adherence to a prescribed oral medication regimen, presence of depressive symptoms, and impaired QoL.
AB  - RESULTS: The total number of major stressful life events in the adolescents with T2D was calculated, with 33% reporting none, 67% reporting > 1, 47% reporting > 2, 33% reporting > 3, and 20% reporting > 4. There were no associations between the major stressors score and physiological measures or diagnosis of comorbidities. The odds of medication nonadherence increased significantly from those reporting > 1 major stressor (OR, 1.58; P = .0265) to those reporting > 4 major stressors (OR, 2.70; P = .0009). Significant odds of elevated depressive symptoms and impaired QoL were also found with increased reporting of major stressors.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Exposure to major stressful life events is associated with lower adherence to prescribed oral medication regimens and impaired psychosocial functioning in adolescents with T2D.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A cluster-randomized trial of task shifting and blood pressure control in Ghana: study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are experiencing an epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD) propelled by rapidly increasing rates of hypertension. Barriers to hypertension control in SSA include poor access to care and high out-of-pocket costs. Although SSA bears 24% of the global disease burden, it has only 3% of the global health workforce. Given such limited resources, cost-effective strategies, such as task shifting, are needed to mitigate the rising CVD epidemic in SSA. Ghana, a country in SSA with an established community health worker program integrated within a national health insurance scheme provides an ideal platform to evaluate implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) task-shifting strategy. This study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the implementation of the WHO Package targeted at CV risk assessment versus provision of health insurance coverage, on blood pressure (BP) reduction.
AB  - METHODS: Using a cluster randomized design, 32 community health centers (CHCs) and district hospitals in Ghana will be randomized to either the intervention group (16 CHCs) or the control group (16 CHCs). A total of 640 patients with uncomplicated hypertension (BP 140-179/90-99 mm Hg and absence of target organ damage) will be enrolled in this study (20 patients per CHC). The intervention consists of WHO Package of CV risk assessment, patient education, initiation and titration of antihypertensive medications, behavioral counseling on lifestyle behaviors, and medication adherence every three months for 12 months. The primary outcome is the mean change in systolic BP from baseline to 12 months. The secondary outcomes are rates of BP control at 12 months; levels of physical activity, percent change in weight, and dietary intake of fruits and vegetables at 12 months; and sustainability of intervention effects at 24 months. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, six months and 12 months. Trained community health nurses will deliver the intervention as part of Ghana's community-based health planning and services (CHPS) program.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will provide policy makers and other stakeholders needed information to recommend scalable and cost-effective policy with respect to comprehensive CV risk reduction and hypertension control in resource-poor settings.

TI  - CPAP versus oxygen in obstructive sleep apnea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with hypertension, inflammation, and increased cardiovascular risk. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces blood pressure, but adherence is often suboptimal, and the benefit beyond management of conventional risk factors is uncertain. Since intermittent hypoxemia may underlie cardiovascular sequelae of sleep apnea, we evaluated the effects of nocturnal supplemental oxygen and CPAP on markers of cardiovascular risk.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in which patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors were recruited from cardiology practices. Patients were screened for obstructive sleep apnea with the use of the Berlin questionnaire, and home sleep testing was used to establish the diagnosis. Participants with an apnea-hypopnea index of 15 to 50 events per hour were randomly assigned to receive education on sleep hygiene and healthy lifestyle alone (the control group) or, in addition to education, either CPAP or nocturnal supplemental oxygen. Cardiovascular risk was assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of the study treatment. The primary outcome was 24-hour mean arterial pressure.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 318 patients who underwent randomization, 281 (88%) could be evaluated for ambulatory blood pressure at both baseline and follow-up. On average, the 24-hour mean arterial pressure at 12 weeks was lower in the group receiving CPAP than in the control group (-2.4 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.7 to -0.1; P=0.04) or the group receiving supplemental oxygen (-2.8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.1 to -0.5; P=0.02). There was no significant difference in the 24-hour mean arterial pressure between the control group and the group receiving oxygen. A sensitivity analysis performed with the use of multiple imputation approaches to assess the effect of missing data did not change the results of the primary analysis.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP, but not nocturnal supplemental oxygen, resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure.

TI  - Blood pressure improvement with continuous positive airway pressure is independent of obstructive sleep apnea severity.[Erratum appears in J Clin Sleep Med. 2014;10(6):711 Note: Barandiaran, Felipe Aizpuru [corrected to Aizpuru, Felipe]]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We sought to perform a patient-level meta-analysis using the individual patient data of the trials identified in our previous study-level meta-analysis investigating the effect of positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on blood pressure (BP).
AB  - DESIGN: Patient-level meta-analysis.
AB  - SETTING: N/A.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 968 adult OSA subjects without major comorbidities drawn from eight randomized controlled trials.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic PAP versus non-therapeutic control conditions (sham-PAP, pill placebo or standard care) over at least one week.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean reductions in BP between PAP and non-therapeutic control arms were -2.27 mm Hg (95% CI -4.01 to -0.54) for systolic BP and -1.78 mm Hg (95% CI -2.99 to -0.58) for diastolic BP. The presence of uncontrolled hypertension at baseline was significantly associated with a reduction in systolic BP of 7.1 mm Hg and diastolic BP of 4.3 mm Hg after controlling for OSA severity (apnea-hypopnea index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, PAP level), patient demographics (age, gender, body mass index, use of antihypertensive medication/s), and measures of PAP efficacy (PAP adherence and treatment duration).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: OSA patients with uncontrolled hypertension are likely to gain the largest benefit from PAP in terms of a substantial reduction in BP, even after controlling for disease severity.

TI  - Youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus: lessons learned from the TODAY study.
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly diagnosed in obese children and adolescents. Evidence suggests that this disease commonly progresses more rapidly in youth compared with adults and is associated with high rates of early microalbuminuria, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study was the first multiethnic, multicenter randomized trial in the United States to compare 3 treatment approaches in obese youth with new-onset type 2 diabetes (n=699; ages 10-17 years): monotherapy with metformin, metformin with rosiglitazone, and metformin with an intensive lifestyle intervention. The primary outcome was glycemic control. Diabetes-related complications and cardiovascular risk factors were also examined. Approximately half of the participants could not maintain glycemic control by using metformin alone. Combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone resulted in better durability of glycemic control, and metformin plus intensive lifestyle intervention was intermediate but not superior to metformin alone. Deterioration in glycemic control was associated with rapid loss of beta cell function, not worsened insulin sensitivity, and could not be explained by differences in adherence or body mass index. After 3.9 years, 236 (33.8%) of participants had hypertension and 116 participants (16.6%) had microalbuminuria. Only 55.9% of participants had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 100 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) after 3 years, and 71 of 517 participants (13.7%) had retinopathy. The significance of the findings from this important trial for the management of youth and young adults with youth-onset type 2 diabetes and its complications is discussed. An aggressive multifaceted approach is needed to prevent or forestall premature microvascular and macrovascular complications in youth-onset type 2 diabetes.

TI  - An investigation of associations between clinicians' ethnic or racial bias and hypertension treatment, medication adherence and blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have directly investigated the association of clinicians' implicit (unconscious) bias with health care disparities in clinical settings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinicians' implicit ethnic or racial bias is associated with processes and outcomes of treatment for hypertension among black and Latino patients, relative to white patients.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Primary care clinicians completed Implicit Association Tests of ethnic and racial bias. Electronic medical records were queried for a stratified, random sample of the clinicians' black, Latino and white patients to assess treatment intensification, adherence and control of hypertension. Multilevel random coefficient models assessed the associations between clinicians' implicit biases and ethnic or racial differences in hypertension care and outcomes.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Standard measures of treatment intensification and medication adherence were calculated from pharmacy refills. Hypertension control was assessed by the percentage of time that patients met blood pressure goals recorded during primary care visits.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight primary care clinicians and 4,794 patients with hypertension participated. Black patients received equivalent treatment intensification, but had lower medication adherence and worse hypertension control than white patients; Latino patients received equivalent treatment intensification and had similar hypertension control, but lower medication adherence than white patients. Differences in treatment intensification, medication adherence and hypertension control were unrelated to clinician implicit bias for black patients (P = 0.85, P = 0.06 and P = 0.31, respectively) and for Latino patients (P = 0.55, P = 0.40 and P = 0.79, respectively). An increase in clinician bias from average to strong was associated with a relative change of less than 5 % in all outcomes for black and Latino patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Implicit bias did not affect clinicians' provision of care to their minority patients, nor did it affect the patients' outcomes. The identification of health care contexts in which bias does not impact outcomes can assist both patients and clinicians in their efforts to build trust and partnership.

TI  - Efficacy of a text messaging (SMS) based intervention for adults with hypertension: protocol for the StAR (SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial) randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions to support people with hypertension in attending clinics and taking their medication have potential to improve outcomes, but delivery on a wide scale and at low cost is challenging. Some trials evaluating clinical interventions using short message service (SMS) text-messaging systems have shown important outcomes, although evidence is limited. We have developed a novel SMS system integrated with clinical care for use by people with hypertension in a low-resource setting. We aim to test the efficacy of the system in improving blood pressure control and treatment adherence compared to usual care.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial (StAR) is a pragmatic individually randomised three-arm parallel group trial in adults treated for hypertension at a single primary care centre in Cape Town, South Africa. The intervention is a structured programme of clinic appointment, medication pick-up reminders, medication adherence support and hypertension-related education delivered remotely using an automated system with either informational or interactive SMS text-messages. Usual care is supplemented by infrequent non-hypertension related SMS text-messages. Participants are 1:1:1 individually randomised, to usual care or to one of the two active interventions using minimisation to dynamically adjust for gender, age, baseline systolic blood pressure, years with hypertension, and previous clinic attendance. The primary outcome is the change in mean systolic blood pressure at 12-month follow-up from baseline measured with research staff blinded to trial allocation. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with 80% or more of days medication available, proportion of participants achieving a systolic blood pressure less than 140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, hospital admissions, health status, retention in clinical care, satisfaction with treatment and care, and patient related quality of life. Anonymised demographic data are collected on non-participants.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The StAR trial uses a novel, low cost system based on widely available mobile phone technology to deliver the SMS-based intervention, manage communication with patients, and measure clinically relevant outcomes. The results will inform implementation and wider use of mobile phone based interventions for health care delivery in a low-resource setting.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of nighttime dosing of antihypertensives: review of the literature and design of a pragmatic clinical trial. [Review]
AB  - Blood pressure exhibits circadian variability, and nighttime blood pressure is one of the best predictors of cardiovascular (CV) events. Adults with hypertension who lack a nighttime dipping pattern are at particularly high risk. Several studies have found that bedtime dosing of antihypertensive agents reduces sleep blood pressure and improves the dipping pattern in nondippers. One small study and 2 substudies of diabetes and chronic kidney disease suggest that bedtime dosing of > 1 antihypertensives significantly reduced CV events. A Cochrane review of 5 studies found no difference in adverse events between morning and evening dosing. However, several evaluations in ophthalmology have found that nocturnal arterial hypotension precipitated ocular vascular disorders such as ischemic optic neuropathy. Some authors have suggested that additional studies of nighttime dosing of antihypertensive agents that evaluate CV events need to be conducted. The authors describe a randomized controlled pragmatic trial that is being planned at the University of Iowa and Duke University. Patients with hypertension and other comorbid conditions will be randomized to either continue morning dosing of all antihypertensive agents or to switch their nondiuretic medications to bedtime dosing. Patients will be followed for 36 to 42 months. This study will determine whether nighttime dosing reduces CV risk when compared with traditional morning dosing of antihypertensive agents.Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES): rationale for a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist-administered intervention for achieving cardiovascular disease risk reduction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are significant, but often preventable, contributors to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Medication and behavioral nonadherence are significant barriers to successful hypertension, hyperlidemia, and diabetes management. Our objective was to describe the theoretical framework underlying a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist-administered intervention for achieving CVD risk reduction.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults with poorly controlled hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia were enrolled from three outpatient primary care clinics associated with the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Durham, NC). Participants were randomly assigned to receive a pharmacist-administered, tailored, 1-year telephone-based intervention or usual care. The goal of the study was to reduce the risk for CVD through a theory-driven intervention to increase medication adherence and improve health behaviors.
AB  - RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2011 and is ongoing. The target sample size is 500 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) intervention has been designed with a strong theoretical underpinning. The theoretical foundation and intervention are designed to encourage patients with multiple comorbidities and poorly controlled CVD risk factors to engage in home-based monitoring and tailored telephone-based interventions. Evidence suggests that clinical pharmacist-administered telephone-based interventions may be efficiently integrated into primary care for patients with poorly controlled CVD risk factors.

TI  - Implementation of the NHLBI integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: rationale and study design for young hearts, strong starts, a cluster-randomized trial targeting body mass index, blood pressure, and tobacco.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the underlying atherosclerosis begin in childhood, and their presence and intensity are related to known cardiovascular disease risk factors. Attention to risk factor control in childhood has the potential to reduce subsequent risk of CVD.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Young Hearts Strong Starts Study was designed to test strategies facilitating adoption of the National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute supported Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents. This study compares guideline-based quality measures for body mass index, blood pressure, and tobacco using two strategies: a multifaceted, practice-directed intervention versus standard dissemination.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Two primary care research networks recruited practices and provided support for the intervention and outcome evaluations. Individual practices were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups using a cluster randomized design based on network affiliation, number of clinicians per practice, urban versus nonurban location, and practice type. The units of observation are individual children because measure adherence is abstracted from individual patient's medical records. The units of randomization are physician practices. This results in a multilevel design in which patients are nested within practices. The intervention practices received toolkits and supported guideline implementation including academic detailing, an ongoing e-learning group. This project is aligned with the American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification requirements including monthly physician self-abstraction, webinars, and other elements of the trial.
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: This trial will provide an opportunity to demonstrate tools and strategies to enhance CV prevention in children by guideline-based interventions.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - EHR-based medication support and nurse-led medication therapy management: rationale and design for a three-arm clinic randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic conditions often use complex medical regimens. A nurse-led strategy to support medication therapy management incorporated into primary care teams may lead to improved use of medications for disease control. Electronic health record (EHR) tools may offer a lower-cost, less intensive approach to improving medication management.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study is a health center-level cluster-randomized trial being conducted within a network of federally qualified community health centers. Health centers have been enrolled in groups of 3 and randomized to (1) usual care, (2) EHR-based medication management tools alone, or (3) EHR tools plus nurse-led medication therapy management. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are prescribed > 3 medications of any kind are recruited from the centers. EHR tools include a printed medication list to prompt review at each visit and automated plain-language medication information within the after-visit summary to encourage proper medication use. In the nurse-led intervention, patients receive one-on-one counseling about their medication regimens to clarify medication discrepancies and identify drug-related concerns, safety issues, and nonadherence. Nurses also provide follow-up telephone calls following new prescriptions and periodically to perform medication review. The primary study outcome is systolic blood pressure after 1 year. Secondary outcomes include measures of understanding of dosing instructions, discrepancies between patient-reported medications and the medical record, adherence, and intervention costs.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study will assess the effects of 2 approaches to support outpatient medication management among patients with uncontrolled hypertension in federally qualified health center settings.

TI  - The Heart Healthy Lenoir project--an intervention to reduce disparities in hypertension control: study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in blood pressure control are well established; however the impact of low health literacy (LHL) on blood pressure has garnered less attention. Office based interventions that are created with iterative patient, practice and community stakeholder input and are rolled out incrementally, may help address these disparities in hypertension control. This paper describes our study protocol.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Using a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach, we designed and implemented a cohort study that includes both a practice level and patient level intervention to enhance the care and support of patients with hypertension in primary care practices in a rural region of eastern North Carolina. The study is divided into a formative phase and an ongoing 2.5 year implementation phase. Our main care enhancement activities include the integration of a community health coach, using home blood pressure monitoring in clinical decision making, standardizing care delivery processes, and working to improve medication adherence. Main outcomes include overall blood pressure change, the differential change in blood pressure by race (African American vs. White) and health literacy level (low vs. higher health literacy).
AB  - DISCUSSION: Using a community based participatory approach in primary care practice settings has helped to engage patients and practice staff and providers in the research effort and in making practice changes to support hypertension care. Practices have engaged at varying levels, but progress has been made in implementing and iteratively improving upon the interventions to date.

TI  - Improving refill adherence and hypertension control in black patients: Wisconsin TEAM trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and sustainability of a 6-month Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) intervention for black patients with hypertension in community chain pharmacies.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial.
AB  - SETTING: 28 chain pharmacies (14 TEAM and 14 control) in five Wisconsin cities from December 2006 to February 2009.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 576 black patients with hypertension.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Trained pharmacist-technician teams implemented a 6-month intervention using scheduled visits, Brief Medication Questionnaires (BMQs), and novel toolkits for facilitating medication adherence and pharmacist feedback to patients and physicians. Control participants received patient information only.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refill adherence (>80% days covered) and changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and blood pressure control using blinded assessments at 6 and 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: At baseline, all patients had blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more. Of those eligible, 79% activated the intervention (mean 4.25 visits). Compared with control participants at 6 months, TEAM participants achieved greater improvements in refill adherence (60% vs. 34%, P < 0.001), SBP (-12.62 vs. -5.31 mm Hg, P < 0.001), and blood pressure control (50% vs. 36%, P = 0.01). Six months after intervention discontinuation, TEAM participants showed sustained improvements in refill adherence ( P < 0.001) and SBP ( P = 0.004), though the difference in blood pressure control was not significant ( P < 0.05) compared with control participants. Analysis of intervention fidelity showed that patients who received the full intervention during months 1 through 6 achieved significantly greater 6- and 12-month improvements in refill adherence and blood pressure control compared with control participants.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A team-based intervention involving community chain pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and novel toolkits led to significant and sustained improvements in refill adherence and SBP in black patients with hypertension.

TI  - Effects of individual physician-level and practice-level financial incentives on hypertension care: a randomized trial.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Pay for performance is intended to align incentives to promote high-quality care, but results have been contradictory.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of explicit financial incentives to reward guideline-recommended hypertension care.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized trial of 12 Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics with 5 performance periods and a 12-month washout that enrolled 83 primary care physicians and 42 nonphysician personnel (eg, nurses, pharmacists).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Physician-level (individual) incentives, practice-level incentives, both, or none. Intervention participants received up to 5 payments every 4 months; all participants could access feedback reports.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Among a random sample, number of patients achieving guideline-recommended blood pressure thresholds or receiving an appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure, number of patients prescribed guideline-recommended medications, and number who developed hypotension.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean (SD) total payments over the study were $4270 ($459), $2672 ($153), and $1648 ($248) for the combined, individual, and practice-level interventions, respectively. The unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change over the study in patients meeting the combined blood pressure/appropriate response measure were 75% to 84% and 8.84% (95% CI, 4.20% to 11.80%) for the individual group, 80% to 85% and 3.70% (95% CI, 0.24% to 7.68%) for the practice-level group, 79% to 88% and 5.54% (95% CI, 1.92% to 9.52%) for the combined group, and 86% to 86% and 0.47% (95% CI, -3.12% to 4.04%) for the control group. The adjusted absolute estimated difference in the change between the proportion of patients with blood pressure control/appropriate response for individual incentive and control groups was 8.36% (95% CI, 2.40% to 13.00%; P=.005). The other incentive groups did not show a significant change compared with controls for this outcome. For medications, the unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change were 61% to 73% and 9.07% (95% CI, 4.52% to 13.44%), 56% to 65% and 4.98% (95% CI, 0.64% to 10.08%), 65% to 80% and 7.26% (95% CI, 2.92% to 12.48%), and 63% to 72% and 4.35% (95% CI, -0.28% to 9.28%), respectively. These changes in the use of guideline-recommended medications were not significant in any of the incentive groups compared with controls, nor was the incidence of hypotension. The effect of the incentive was not sustained after a washout.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Individual financial incentives, but not practice-level or combined incentives, resulted in greater blood pressure control or appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure; none of the incentives resulted in greater use of guideline-recommended medications or increased incidence of hypotension compared with controls. Further research is needed on the factors that contributed to these findings.

TI  - Effects of a web-based patient activation intervention to overcome clinical inertia on blood pressure control: cluster randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Only approximately half of patients with hypertension have their blood pressure controlled, due in large part to the tendency of primary care providers (PCPs) not to intensify treatment when blood pressure values are elevated.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study tested the effect of an intervention designed to help patients ask questions at the point of care to encourage PCPs to appropriately intensify blood pressure treatment.
AB  - METHODS: PCPs and their patients with hypertension (N=500) were recruited by letter and randomized into 2 study groups: (1) intervention condition in which patients used a fully automated website each month to receive tailored messages suggesting questions to ask their PCP to improve blood pressure control, and (2) control condition in which a similar tool suggested questions to ask about preventive services (eg, cancer screening). The Web-based tool was designed to be used during each of the 12 study months and before scheduled visits with PCPs. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients in both conditions with controlled blood pressure.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 500 enrolled patients (intervention condition: n=282; control condition: n=218), 418 (83.6%) completed the 12-month follow-up visit. At baseline, 289 (61.5%) of participants had controlled blood pressure. Most (411/500, 82.2%) participants used the intervention during at least 6 of 12 months and 222 (62.5%) reported asking questions directly from the Web-based tool. There were no group differences in asking about medication intensification and there were no differences in blood pressure control after 12 months between the intervention condition (201/282, 71.3%) and control condition (143/218, 65.6%; P=.27) groups. More intervention condition participants discussed having a creatinine test (92, 52.6% vs 49, 35.5%; P=.02) and urine protein test (81, 44.8% vs 21, 14.6%; P<.001), but no group differences were observed in the rate of testing. The control condition participants reported more frequent discussions about tetanus and pneumonia vaccines and reported more tetanus (30, 13.8% vs 15, 5.3%; P=.02) and pneumonia (25, 11.5% vs 16, 5.7%; P=.02) vaccinations after 12 months.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The use of an interactive website designed to overcome clinical inertia for hypertension care did not lead to improvements in blood pressure control. Participant adherence to the intervention was high. The control intervention led to positive changes in the use of preventive services (eg, tetanus immunization) and the intervention condition led to more discussions of hypertension-relevant tests (eg, serum creatinine and urine protein). By providing patients with individually tailored questions to ask during PCP visits, this study demonstrated that participants were likely to discuss the questions with PCPs. These discussions did not, however, lead to improvements in blood pressure control.

TI  - A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of varenicline for smokeless tobacco dependence in India.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The rate of smokeless tobacco use in India is 20%; its use causes serious health problems, and no trial has assessed behavioral or pharmacological treatments for this public health concern. This trial evaluated varenicline for treating smokeless tobacco dependence in India.
AB  - METHODS: This was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of varenicline (12 weeks, 1mg, twice per day) with 237 smokeless tobacco users in India. All participants received behavioral counseling. Outcomes included self-reported and biochemically verified abstinence at the end of treatment (EOT), lapse and recovery events, safety, and medication adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Self-reported EOT abstinence was significantly greater for varenicline (43%) versus placebo (31%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-4.2, p = .009). Biochemically confirmed EOT abstinence was greater for varenicline versus placebo (25.2% vs. 19.5%), but this was not statistically different (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.84-3.1, p = .15). Compared with placebo, varenicline did not reduce the risk for a lapse (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.69-1.1, p = .14), but it did increase the likelihood of recovery to abstinence (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.02-1.4, p = .02). Greater adherence increased EOT cessation rates for varenicline (39% vs. 18%, p = .003) but not for placebo (28% vs. 14%, p = .06). There were no significant differences between varenicline and placebo in rate of side effects, serious adverse events, hypertension, or stopping or reducing medication.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Varenicline is safe for treating smokeless tobacco dependence in India, and further examination of this medication for this important public health problem is warranted.

TI  - Characteristics of diabetic patients associated with achieving and maintaining blood pressure targets in the Adherence and Intensification of Medications program.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine patient characteristics associated with achieving and sustaining blood pressure (BP) targets in the Adherence and Intensification of Medications program, a program led by pharmacists trained in motivational interviewing and authorized to make BP medication changes.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with diabetes and persistent hypertension in Kaiser Permanente and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Using two-level logistic regression, baseline survey data from 458 program participants were examined to determine patient characteristics associated with (1) discharge from the program with a target BP (short-term success) and (2) maintenance of the target BP over a nine-month period (long-term success).
AB  - RESULTS: In multivariable analyses, patients who screened positive for depression or had a higher baseline systolic BP were less likely to achieve short-term success (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.42 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.19-0.93], p=0.03; AOR 0.94 [0.91-0.97], p<0.01; respectively). Patients who reported at baseline one or more barriers to medication adherence were less likely to achieve long-term success (AOR 0.50 [0.26-0.94], p=0.03).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Although almost 90% of patients achieved short-term success, only 28% achieved long-term success. Baseline barriers to adherence were associated with lack of long-term success and could be the target of maintenance programs for patients who achieve short-term success.

TI  - Association of race consciousness with the patient-physician relationship, medication adherence, and blood pressure in urban primary care patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Race consciousness (the frequency with which one thinks about his or her own race) is a measure that may be useful in assessing whether racial discrimination negatively impacts blood pressure (BP). However, the relation between race consciousness and BP has yet to be empirically tested, especially within the context of the patient-physician relationship and medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: Race-stratified generalized estimating equations were used to assess the relationship of race consciousness on BP, measures of the patient-physician relationship, and self-reported medication adherence, controlling for patients being nested within physicians and for patient age and sex.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 61.3 years, 62% were black, and 65% were women. Black patients were more likely to ever think about race than were white patients (49% vs. 21%; P < 0.001). Race-conscious blacks had significantly higher diastolic BP (79.4 vs. 74.5 mm Hg; P = 0.004) and somewhat higher systolic BP (138.8 vs. 134.7 mm Hg; P = 0.13) than blacks who were not race conscious. Race-conscious whites were more likely to perceive respect from their physician (57.1% vs. 25.8%; P = 0.01) but had lower medication adherence (62.4% vs. 82.9%; P = 0.05) than whites who were not race-conscious.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Among blacks, race consciousness was associated with higher diastolic BP. In contrast, among whites, there was no association between race consciousness and BP, but race consciousness was associated with poor ratings of adherence, despite more favorable ratings of the patient-physician relationship. Future work should explore disparities in race consciousness and its impact on health and health-care disparities.Copyright © American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2013. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of health literacy on desire for participation in healthcare, medical visit communication, and patient reported outcomes among patients with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low health literacy (HL) is associated with poor healthcare outcomes; mechanisms for these associations remain unclear.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate how HL influences patients' interest in participating in healthcare, medical visit communication, and patient reported visit outcomes.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study of enrollment data from a randomized controlled trial of interventions to improve patient adherence to hypertension treatments. Participants were 41 primary care physicians and 275 of their patients. Prior to the enrollment visit, physicians received a minimal intervention or communication skills training and patients received a minimal intervention or a pre-visit coaching session. This resulted in four intervention groups (minimal patient/minimal physician; minimal patient/intensive physician; intensive patient/minimal physician; and intensive patient/intensive physician).
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine; patients' desire for involvement in decision making; communication behaviors; patient ratings of participatory decision making (PDM), trust, and satisfaction.
AB  - RESULTS: A lower percentage of patients with low versus adequate literacy had controlled blood pressure. Both groups were similarly interested in participating in medical decision making. Communication behaviors did not differ based on HL except for medical question asking by patients, which was lower among low literacy patients. This was particularly true in the intensive patient /intensive physician group (3.85 vs. 6.42 questions; p = 0.002). Overall, ratings of care didn't differ based on HL; however, in analyses stratified by intervention assignment, patients with low literacy in minimal physician intervention groups reported significantly lower PDM scores than adequate literacy patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low and adequate literacy were similarly interested in participating in medical decision making. However, low literacy patients were less likely to experience PDM in their visits. Low literacy patients in the intensive physician intervention groups asked fewer medical questions. Patients with low literacy may be less able to respond to physicians' use of patient-centered communication approaches than adequate literacy patients.

TI  - Pilot trial of a licensed practical nurse intervention for hypertension and depression.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Depression is a risk factor for hypertension, and risk of depression is increased substantially in patients with hypertension. Our objective was to examine whether an intervention carried out by Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) integrating depression treatment into care for hypertension improved blood pressure control and depressive symptoms.
AB  - METHODS: In all, 60 patients ages 41 to 92 years with hypertension and depressive symptoms at a large primary care practice in Philadelphia were randomly assigned to an integrated care intervention carried out by LPNs (n=30) or usual care (n=30). Intervention and control groups did not differ statistically on baseline measures. Outcomes assessed at baseline and 12 weeks included standard laboratory procedures to measure blood pressure control and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients in the integrated care intervention had lower diastolic blood pressure (intervention 74.2 mmHg versus usual care 82.0 mmHg) and fewer depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 mean scores, intervention 2.4 versus usual care 7.1) compared with patients in the usual care group at 12 weeks after adjustment for baseline values. Patients in the integrated care intervention also had lower systolic blood pressure (intervention 130.0 mmHg versus usual care 140.6 mmHg) compared with patients in the usual care group at 12 weeks although the results approached but did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Training existing primary care practice office staff will facilitate implementation in real world practices with limited resources and competing demands.

TI  - Antihypertensive medication nonadherence in black men: direct and mediating effects of depressive symptoms, psychosocial stressors, and substance use.
AB  - Black men suffer disproportionately from hypertension. Antihypertensive medication nonadherence is a major contributor to poor blood pressure control, yet few studies consider how psychosocial functioning may impact black men's medication adherence. The authors examined the direct and mediating pathways between depressive symptoms, psychosocial stressors, and substance use on antihypertensive medication nonadherence in 196 black men enrolled in a clinical trial to improve hypertension care and control. The authors found that greater depressive symptoms were associated with more medication nonadherence (beta=0.05; standard error [SE], 0.01; P<.001). None of the psychosocial stressor variables were associated with antihypertensive medication nonadherence. Alcohol misuse was associated with increased medication nonadherence (beta=0.81; SE, 0.26; P<.01), but it did not mediate the association between depressive symptoms and medication nonadherence. Clinicians should consider screening for depressive symptoms and alcohol misuse if patients are found to be nonadherent and should treat or refer patients to appropriate resources to address those issues.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Design of the Blood Pressure Goals in Dialysis pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is markedly increased among hemodialysis (HD) patients. Optimizing blood pressure (BP) among HD patients may present an important opportunity to reduce the disparity in CVD rates between HD patients and the general population. The optimal target predialysis systolic BP (SBP) among HD patients is unknown. Current international guidelines, calling for a predialysis SBP < 140 mm Hg, are based on the opinion and extrapolation from the general population. Existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were small and did not include prespecified BP targets.
AB  - METHODS: The authors described the design of the Blood Pressure in Dialysis (BID) Study, a pilot, multicenter RCT where HD patients are randomized to either a target-standardized predialysis SBP of 110 to 140 mm Hg or 155 to 165 mm Hg. This is the first study to randomize HD patients to 2 different SBP targets.
AB  - RESULTS: Primary outcomes are feasibility and safety. Feasibility parameters include recruitment and retention rates, adherence with prescribed BP measurements and achievement and maintenance of selected BP targets. Safety parameters include rates of hypotension and other adverse and serious adverse events. The authors obtained preliminary data on changes in left ventricular mass, aortic pulse wave velocity, vascular access thromboses and health-related quality of life across study arms, which may be the secondary outcomes in the full-scale study.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The data acquired in the pilot RCT will determine the feasibility and safety and inform the design of a full-scale trial, powered for hard outcomes, which may require 2000 participants.

TI  - Financial incentives and physician commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension management.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of financial incentives on physician goal commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension care.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Clinic-level cluster-randomized trial with 4 arms: individual, group, or combined incentives, and control.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 83 full-time primary care physicians at 12 Veterans Affairs medical centers completed web-based surveys measuring their goal commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension care every 4 months and telephone interviews at months 8 and 16. Intervention arm participants received performance-based incentives every 4 months for 5 periods. All participants received guideline education at baseline and audit and feedback every 4 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Physician goal commitment did not vary over time or across arms. Participants reported patient nonadherence was a perceived barrier and consistent follow-up was a perceived facilitator to successful hypertension care, suggesting that providers may perceive hypertension management as more of a patient responsibility (external locus of control).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives may constitute an insufficiently strong intervention to influence goal commitment when providers attribute performance to external forces beyond their control.

TI  - The Nigerian antihypertensive adherence trial: a community-based randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research in industrialized countries has demonstrated that a key factor limiting the control of hypertension is poor patient adherence and that the most successful interventions for long-term adherence employ multiple strategies. Very little data exist on this question in low-income countries, wherein medication-taking behavior may be less well developed.
AB  - METHOD: We conducted a treatment adherence trial of 544 patients [mean age ~63 years, mean blood pressure (BP) ~168/92 mmHg] with previously untreated hypertension in urban and rural Nigeria. Eligible participants were randomized to one of two arms: clinic management only, or clinic management and home visits. Both interventions included three elements: a community based, nurse-led treatment program with physician backup; facilitation of clinic visits and health education; and the use of diuretics and a beta blocker as needed. After initial diagnosis, the management protocol was implemented by a nurse with physician backup. Participants were evaluated monthly for 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Medication adherence was assessed with pill count and urine testing. Drop-out rates, by treatment group, ranged from 12 to 28%. Among participants who completed the 6-month trial, overall adherence was high (~77% of participants took >98% of prescribed pills). Adherence did not differ by treatment arm, but was better at the rural than the urban site and among those with higher baseline BP. Hypertension control (BP <140/90 mmHg) was achieved in approximately 66% of participants at 6 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This community-based intervention confirms relatively modest default rates compared with industrialized societies, and suggests that medication adherence can be high in developing world settings in clinic attenders.

TI  - The effect of enhanced depression care on adherence to risk-reducing behaviors after acute coronary syndromes: findings from the COPES trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of depression after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with worse prognosis and lower adherence to risk-reducing behaviors. We reported earlier that an enhanced depression care intervention reduces depression symptoms and major adverse cardiac events. This study evaluates the impact of the depression intervention on health behavior and blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: Between 2005 and 2008, 157 patients who remained persistently depressed 3 months after ACS were randomized to a 6-month depression intervention (initial patient preference for problem-solving therapy and/or pharmacotherapy, followed by stepped care; 80 patients) or to usual care (77 patients). At randomization, and then 2, 4, and 6 months later, patients were asked if they (1) missed taking their aspirin; (2) followed a heart healthy diet; (3) exercised regularly; and (4) used tobacco products. Blood pressure was measured before randomization and 6 months later.
AB  - RESULTS: At the end of the intervention, there was no significant improvement in the percentage of intervention compared to control group patients who adhered to aspirin (+3% versus -1%, P = .23), followed a healthy diet (+10% versus +8%, P = .39), exercised regularly (+5% versus +4%, P = .65), abstained from tobacco (-3% versus -1%, P = .77), or had controlled blood pressure (+6% versus +16%, P = .26).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite improving depression, enhanced depression care after an ACS did not improve health behavior or blood pressure control compared to usual care. Research is needed to test whether adding an adherence intervention to enhanced depression care can improve adherence and cardiovascular prognosis in depressed patients post-ACS.Copyright © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

TI  - Adherence to blood pressure telemonitoring in a cluster-randomized clinical trial.
AB  - Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and death worldwide. Advances in technology have added telemedicine as a tool for managing hypertension. The effectiveness of telemedicine depends on patients' ability to adhere to schedules of home monitoring and case management. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension in the intervention arm of a randomized trial who completed 6 months of follow-up were included in this analysis. They were asked to measure their blood pressure (BP) a minimum of 6 times per week using a telemonitor that transmitted the readings to their pharmacist case manager. Hypertensive patients in this study had high adherence to telemonitoring (73% took at least 6 BP readings per week) and phone visits (88% of expected visits were attended). In a multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, and some college education predicted better telemonitoring adherence. White non-Hispanic race/ethnicity predicted better adherence to phone visits with pharmacist case managers. Telemonitoring adherence and phone adherence were highly correlated; participants who did not send readings on schedule were more likely to skip at least one phone visit with their pharmacist case manager. The findings from this analysis indicate that hypertensive patients in this study were able to achieve and maintain high adherence to both the telemonitoring and the phone case management visits.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - A multifaceted prospective memory intervention to improve medication adherence: design of a randomized control trial.
AB  - Adherence to prescribed antihypertensive agents is critical because control of elevated blood pressure is the single most important way to prevent stroke and other end organ damage. Unfortunately, nonadherence remains a significant problem. Previous interventions designed to improve adherence have demonstrated only small benefits of strategies that target single facets such as understanding medication directions. The intervention described here is informed by prospective memory theory and performance of older adults in laboratory-based paradigms and uses a comprehensive, multifaceted approach to improve adherence. It incorporates multiple strategies designed to support key components of prospective remembering involved in taking medication. The intervention is delivered by nurses in the home with an education control group for comparison. Differences between groups in overall adherence following the intervention and 6 months later will be tested. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels also will be examined between groups and as they relate to adherence. Intra-individual regression is planned to examine change in adherence over time and its predictors. Finally, we will examine the association between executive function/working memory and adherence, predicting that adherence will be related to executive/working memory in the control group but not in the intervention group.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Determinants and consequences of adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet in African-American and white adults with high blood pressure: results from the ENCORE trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is an accepted nonpharmacologic treatment for hypertension, little is known about what patient characteristics affect dietary adherence and what level of adherence is needed to reduce blood pressure (BP).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine what factors predict dietary adherence and the extent to which dietary adherence is necessary to produce clinically meaningful BP reductions.
AB  - DESIGN: Ancillary study of the ENCORE (Exercise and Nutrition Interventions for Cardiovascular Health) trial--a 16-week randomized clinical trial of diet and exercise.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants included 144 sedentary, overweight, or obese adults (body mass index 25 to 39.9) with high BP (systolic 130 to 159 mm Hg and/or diastolic 85 to 99 mm Hg).
AB  - INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to one of three groups: DASH diet alone, DASH diet plus weight management, and Usual Diet Controls.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Our primary outcomes were a composite index of adherence to the DASH diet and clinic BP.
AB  - STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: General linear models were used to compare treatment groups on post-treatment adherence to the DASH diet. Linear regression was used to examine potential predictors of post-treatment DASH adherence. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the relation of adherence to the DASH diet and BP.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants in the DASH diet plus weight management (16.1 systolic BP [SBP]; 95% CI 13.0 to 19.2 mm Hg and 9.9 diastolic BP [DBP]; 95% CI 8.1 to 11.6 mm Hg) and DASH diet alone (11.2 SBP; 95% CI 8.1 to 14.3 mm Hg and 7.5 DBP; 95% CI 5.8 to 9.3 mm Hg) groups showed significant reductions in BP in comparison with Usual Diet Controls participants (3.4 SBP; 95% CI 0.4 to 6.4 mm Hg and DBP 3.8; 95% CI 2.2 to 5.5 mm Hg). Greater post-treatment consumption of DASH foods was noted in both the DASH diet alone (mean = 6.20; 95% CI 5.83 to 6.57) and DASH diet plus weight management groups (mean = 6.23; 95% CI 5.88 to 6.59) compared with Usual Diet Controls (mean = 3.66; 95% CI 3.30 to 4.01; P<0.0001), and greater adherence to the DASH diet was associated with larger reductions in clinic SBP and DBP (P < 0.01). Only ethnicity predicted dietary adherence, with African Americans less adherent to the DASH diet compared with whites (4.68; 95% CI 4.34 to 5.03 vs 5.83; 95% CI 5.50 to 6.11; P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Greater adherence to the DASH diet was associated with larger BP reductions independent of weight loss. African Americans were less likely to be adherent to the DASH dietary eating plan compared with whites, suggesting that culturally sensitive dietary strategies might be needed to improve adherence to the DASH diet.Copyright © 2012 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

TI  - Translation and validation of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension for koreans intervention: culturally tailored dietary guidelines for Korean Americans with high blood pressure.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle modification strategies such as adoption of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet are now recognized as an integral part of high blood pressure (HBP) management. Although the high prevalence of HBP among Korean Americans (KAs) is well documented, few dietary interventions have been implemented in this population, in part because of a lack of culturally relevant nutrition education guidelines. Translating and testing the efficacy of culturally relevant dietary recommendations using a well-established dietary guideline such as DASH are imperative for promoting better cardiovascular health for this high-risk cultural group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to systematically translate and validate a culturally modified DASH for Koreans (K-DASH) and obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy.
AB  - METHODS: A 2-step approach of intervention translation and efficacy testing, together with close adherence to principles of community-based participatory research, was used to maximize community input. A 1-group pre-post design with 24-hour urine and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring comparisons was used to test the initial feasibility and efficacy of the K-DASH intervention.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 28 KAs with HBP participated in a 10-week dietary intervention consisting of group education sessions and individual counseling. Both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, as measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, were significantly decreased at postintervention evaluation (systolic blood pressure, -4.5 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure, -2.6 mm Hg; P < .05). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly decreased (-7.3 mg/dL; P < .05). Serum potassium and ascorbic acid levels were also improved in the reference range. Urine potassium level was significantly increased, supporting increased fruit and vegetable consumption.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This pilot study has (a) demonstrated that a cultural adaptation of DASH using community-based participatory research methodology produced a culturally relevant and efficacious dietary intervention for the KAs with HBP and (b) provided strong preliminary evidence for the efficacy of the K-DASH intervention in reducing HBP in hypertensive KAs.

TI  - Translating basic behavioral and social science research to clinical application: the EVOLVE mixed methods approach.[Erratum appears in J Consult Clin Psychol. 2013 Apr;81(2):230]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a mixed-methods approach to develop and test a basic behavioral science-informed intervention to motivate behavior change in 3 high-risk clinical populations. Our theoretically derived intervention comprised a combination of positive affect and self-affirmation (PA/SA), which we applied to 3 clinical chronic disease populations.
AB  - METHOD: We employed a sequential mixed methods model (EVOLVE) to design and test the PA/SA intervention in order to increase physical activity in people with coronary artery disease (post-percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) or asthma (ASM) and to improve medication adherence in African Americans with hypertension (HTN). In an initial qualitative phase, we explored participant values and beliefs. We next pilot tested and refined the intervention and then conducted 3 randomized controlled trials with parallel study design. Participants were randomized to combined PA/SA versus an informational control and were followed bimonthly for 12 months, assessing for health behaviors and interval medical events.
AB  - RESULTS: Over 4.5 years, we enrolled 1,056 participants. Changes were sequentially made to the intervention during the qualitative and pilot phases. The 3 randomized controlled trials enrolled 242 participants who had undergone PCI, 258 with ASM, and 256 with HTN (n = 756). Overall, 45.1% of PA/SA participants versus 33.6% of informational control participants achieved successful behavior change (p = .001). In multivariate analysis, PA/SA intervention remained a significant predictor of achieving behavior change (p < .002, odds ratio = 1.66), 95% CI [1.22, 2.27], controlling for baseline negative affect, comorbidity, gender, race/ethnicity, medical events, smoking, and age.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The EVOLVE method is a means by which basic behavioral science research can be translated into efficacious interventions for chronic disease populations.

TI  - Patient trust in physicians and adoption of lifestyle behaviors to control high blood pressure.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between patients' trust in their physician and self-reported adoption of lifestyle modification behaviors and medication adherence for control of hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of interventions to enhance hypertensive patients' adherence to medications and recommended lifestyle modifications. Two hundred patients were seen by 41 physicians at 14 urban primary care practices in Baltimore, Maryland, and followed for 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Seventy percent of patients reported complete trust in their physician. In adjusted analyses, patients with complete trust had higher odds of reporting that they were trying to lose weight (OR=2.27, 95% CI=1.38-3.74) than did patients with less than complete trust in their physician. Though not statistically significant, the odds of reporting trying to cut back on salt and engaging in regular exercise were greater in patients with complete trust. We observed no association for reports of medication adherence.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Trust in one's physician predicts attempts to lose weight among patients with hypertension, and may contribute to attempts to reduce salt and increase exercise.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Strengthening patient-physician relationships through efforts to enhance trust may be a promising strategy to enhance patients' engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors for hypertension.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - 'Decision support system (DSS) for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among hypertensive (HTN) patients in Andhra Pradesh, India'--a cluster randomised community intervention trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Very few studies having decision support systems as an intervention report on patient outcomes for cardiovascular disease in the Western world. The potential role of decision support system for the management of blood pressure among Indian hypertensives remains unclear. We propose a cluster randomised trial that aims to test the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of DSS among Indian hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: The trial design is a cluster randomised community intervention trial, in which the participants would be adult male and female hypertensive patients, in the age group of 35 to 64 years, reporting to the Primary Health Care centres of Mahabubnagar district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The objective of the study is to test the effectiveness and compare the cost effectiveness and cost utility among hypertensive subjects randomized to receive either decision support system or a chart based algorithmic support system in urban and rural areas of a district in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India (baseline versus 12 months follow up). The primary outcome would be a comparison of the systolic blood pressure at 0 and 12 months among hypertensive patients randomized to receive the decision support system or the chart based algorithmic support system. Computer generated randomisation and an investigator and analyser blinded method would be followed. 1600 participants; 800 to each arm; each arm having eight clusters of hundred participants each have been recruited between 01 August 2011 - 01 March 2012. A twelve month follow up will be completed by March 2013 and results are expected by April 2013.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This cluster randomized community intervention trial on DSS will enable policy makers to find out the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and cost utility of decision support system for management of blood pressure among hypertensive patients in India. Most of the previous studies on decision support system have focused on physician performance, adherence and on preventive care reminders. The uniqueness of the proposed study lies in finding out the effectiveness of a decision support system on patient related outcomes.

TI  - Improving blood pressure control through a clinical pharmacist outreach program in patients with diabetes mellitus in 2 high-performing health systems: the adherence and intensification of medications cluster randomized, controlled pragmatic trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even in high-performing health systems, some patients with diabetes mellitus have poor blood pressure (BP) control because of poor medication adherence and lack of medication intensification. We examined whether the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention, a pharmacist-led intervention combining elements found in efficacy studies to lower BP, improved BP among patients with diabetes mellitus with persistent hypertension and poor refill adherence or insufficient medication intensification in 2 high-performing health systems.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective, multisite cluster randomized pragmatic trial with randomization of 16 primary care teams at 5 medical centers (3 Veterans Affairs and 2 Kaiser Permanente) to the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was relative change in systolic BP (SBP), comparing 1797 intervention with 2303 control team patients, from 6 months preceding to 6 months after the 14-month intervention period. We examined shorter-term changes in SBP as a secondary outcome. The mean SBP decrease from 6 months before to 6 months after the intervention period was =9 mm Hg in both arms. Mean SBPs of eligible intervention patients were 2.4 mm Hg lower (95% CI: -3.4 to -1.5; P<0.001) immediately after the intervention than those achieved by control patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Adherence and Intensification of Medications program more rapidly lowered SBPs among intervention patients, but usual-care patients achieved equally low SBP levels by 6 months after the intervention period. These findings show the importance of evaluating in different real-life clinical settings programs found in efficacy trials to be effective before urging their widespread adoption in all settings.

TI  - Diet and exercise adherence and practices among medically underserved patients with chronic disease: variation across four ethnic groups.
AB  - Many factors interact to create barriers to dietary and exercise plan adherence among medically underserved patients with chronic disease, but aspects related to culture and ethnicity are underexamined in the literature. Using both qualitative (n = 71) and quantitative (n = 297) data collected in a 4-year, multimethod study among patients with hypertension and/or diabetes, the authors explored differences in self-reported adherence to diet and exercise plans and self-reported daily diet and exercise practices across four ethnic groups-Whites, Blacks, Vietnamese, and Latinos-at a primary health care center in Massachusetts. Adherence to diet and exercise plans differed across ethnic groups even after controlling for key sociodemographic variables, with Vietnamese participants reporting the highest adherence. Food and exercise options were shaped by economic constraints as well as ethnic and cultural familiarity with certain foods and types of activity. These findings indicate that health care providers should consider ethnicity and economic status together to increase effectiveness in encouraging diverse populations with chronic disease to make healthy lifestyle changes.

TI  - Predictors of lowering SBP to assigned targets at 12 months in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lowering blood pressure for secondary stroke prevention remains a challenge. These analyses were conducted to identify factors predicting achievement of SBP targets in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) study.
AB  - METHODS: SPS3 is a randomized trial assigning patients with lacunar stroke to two targets of SBP control (130-149 mmHg or <130 mmHg). Logistic regression models were used to identify patient and SPS3 site characteristics predictive of lowering SBP to target at the 12-month study visit.
AB  - RESULTS: Of those above target at baseline (n = 1041), 69% were within their assigned target at 12 months. In the model with baseline characteristics only, those receiving treatment for hypertension at baseline were 68% less likely to achieve target [odds ratio (OR) = 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.17-0.60], whereas those of Hispanic ethnicity were 1.49 times more likely (95% CI = 1.09-2.03) to achieve SBP target. When clinical site characteristics were added to the model, only treated hypertension at baseline remained significant. In addition, management at a larger site (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.03-2.20), SBP in target at 6 months (OR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.79-3.19), and medication adherence (OR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.51-4.95) were positively associated with achieving target SBP. Missed appointments (OR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.41-0.73) were negatively associated with lowering SBP to target at 12 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve targets of SBP control in this multiethnic stroke cohort across multiple sites and countries. The results highlight the important variables reflecting clinical site management.

TI  - Metformin monotherapy in youth with recent onset type 2 diabetes: experience from the prerandomization run-in phase of the TODAY study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: TODAY (Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) is a federally funded multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing three treatments of youth onset type 2 diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of youth participating in a 2-6 month run-in period in preparation for randomization into TODAY.
AB  - SUBJECTS: An ethnically diverse sample of 927 youth, 65.4% females, aged 13.7 +/- 2.0 yr old, with type 2 diabetes for a median of 2 months (0.7-7.8 months, 25th-75th percentiles).
AB  - METHODS: A run-in period was conducted to achieve HbA1c <8% with metformin monotherapy and diabetes education, and to evaluate adherence to pill taking, visit attendance, and other procedures.
AB  - RESULTS: At entry, mean body mass index (BMI) and z-BMI were 35.6 +/- 7.7 and 2.3 +/- 0.4, respectively, mean HbA1c was 7.7 +/- 2.2%, only 42.5% were on a hypoglycemic treatment, and 35.6% had HbA1c >8%. Comorbid conditions were common; 18.8% had hypertension, 24.2% had elevated cholesterol, and 6.5% had abnormal liver enzymes. After a median 71 d of run-in, 90.9% had HbA1c <8%, 77.9% had HbA1c <7%, and 46.4% had HbA1c <6%. Of the 772 youth achieving the target HbA1c <8%, 704 (91.2%) were randomized; non-adherence to metformin treatment was the main cause for non-randomization. Youth proceeding to randomization decreased weight by 0.68kg and HbA1c by 1.45% compared to a weight gain of 0.71kg and HbA1c decrease of 0.74% in the non-randomized youth (p = 0.01 in both cases). However, change in z-BMI was not significantly different between the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Most youth with recent onset type 2 diabetes can achieve target HbA1c <8.0% with short-term metformin monotherapy and standard diabetes education (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00081328).Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TI  - Approach to antihypertensive adherence: a feasibility study on the use of student health coaches for uninsured hypertensive adults.
AB  - Despite pharmacologic advances, medication non-adherence continues to challenge primary care providers in blood pressure (BP) management. Medical, nursing and pharmacy students (n=11) were recruited and trained as health coaches for uninsured, hypertensive patients (n=25) of a free clinic in an uncontrolled open trial. Pre-post analysis was conducted on BP, medication adherence, frequency of home BP monitoring, and health behavior (eg, diet, exercise). Patient satisfaction and feasibility of a student coach model was qualitatively evaluated. In the 12 patients who completed the intervention, an increase in medication adherence as measured by the Brief Medication Questionnaire was observed (P<.01), with a 11 mmHg reduction in systolic BP (P=.03). Qualitative data showed patient satisfaction with the intervention and other health behavior change. This feasibility study shows use of student health coaches to combat medication non-adherence in uninsured, hypertensive adults is promising.

TI  - The effect of patient-provider communication on medication adherence in hypertensive black patients: does race concordance matter?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence of a positive effect of collaborative patient-provider communication on patient outcomes, our understanding of this relationship is unclear.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to determine whether racial composition of the relationship modified the association between ratings of provider communication and medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: Effect modification of the communication-adherence association, by racial composition of the relationship, was evaluated using general linear mixed models while adjusting for selected covariates.
AB  - RESULTS: Three hundred ninety patients were in race-concordant (black patient, black provider) relationships, while 207 were in race-discordant (black patient, white provider) relationships. The communication-adherence association was significantly modified in race-discordant relationships (p = 0.04). Communication rated as more collaborative in race-discordant relationships was associated with better adherence, while communication rated as less collaborative was associated with poor adherence. There was no significant association between adherence and communication in race-concordant relationships (p = 0.24).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative patient-provider communication may play an influential role in black patients' adherence behaviors when receiving care from white providers.

TI  - Increasing physical activity in patients with asthma through positive affect and self-affirmation: a randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma engage in less physical activity than peers without asthma. Protocols are needed to prudently increase physical activity in asthma patients. We evaluated whether an educational intervention enhanced with positive-affect induction and self-affirmation was more effective than the educational protocol alone in increasing physical activity in asthma patients.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial in New York City from September 28, 2004, through July 5, 2007; of 258 asthma patients, 252 completed the trial. At enrollment, control subjects completed a survey measuring energy expenditure, made a contract to increase physical activity, received a pedometer and an asthma workbook, and then underwent bimonthly follow-up telephone calls. Intervention patients received this protocol plus small gifts and instructions in fostering positive affect and self-affirmation. The main outcome was the within-patient change in energy expenditure in kilocalories per week from enrollment to 12 months with an intent-to-treat analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean (SD) energy expenditure at enrollment was 1767 (1686) kcal/wk among controls and 1860 (1633) kcal/wk among intervention patients (P = .65) and increased by 415 (95% CI, 76-754; P = .02) and 398 (95% CI, 145-652; P = .002) kcal/wk, respectively, with no difference between groups (P = .94). For both groups, energy expenditure was sustained through 12 months. No adverse events were attributed to the trial. In multivariate analysis, increased energy expenditure was associated with less social support, decreased depressive symptoms, more follow-up calls, use of the pedometer, fulfillment of the contract, and the intervention among patients who required urgent asthma care (all P < .10, 2-sided test).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multiple-component protocol was effective in increasing physical activity in asthma patients, but an intervention to increase positive affect and self-affirmation was not effective within this protocol. The intervention may have had some benefit, however, in the subgroup of patients who required urgent asthma care during the trial. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00195117.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of positive-affect intervention and medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence explains poor blood pressure (BP) control; however African Americans suffer worse hypertension-related outcomes.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial evaluated whether a patient education intervention enhanced with positive-affect induction and self-affirmation (PA) was more effective than patient education (PE) alone in improving medication adherence and BP reduction among 256 hypertensive African Americans followed up in 2 primary care practices. Patients in both groups received a culturally tailored hypertension self-management workbook, a behavioral contract, and bimonthly telephone calls designed to help them overcome barriers to medication adherence. Also, patients in the PA group received small gifts and bimonthly telephone calls to help them incorporate positive thoughts into their daily routine and foster self-affirmation. The main outcome measures were medication adherence (assessed with electronic pill monitors) and within-patient change in BP from baseline to 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were similar in both groups: the mean BP was 137/82 mm Hg; 36% of the patients had diabetes; 11% had stroke; and 3% had chronic kidney disease. Based on the intention-to-treat principle, medication adherence at 12 months was higher in the PA group than in the PE group (42% vs 36%, respectively; P =.049). The within-group reduction in systolic BP (2.14 mm Hg vs 2.18 mm Hg; P = .98) and diastolic BP (-1.59 mm Hg vs -0.78 mm Hg; P = .45) for the PA group and PE group, respectively, was not significant.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A PE intervention enhanced with PA led to significantly higher medication adherence compared with PE alone in hypertensive African Americans. Future studies should assess the cost-effectiveness of integrating such interventions into primary care. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00227175.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of positive-affect induction to promote physical activity after percutaneous coronary intervention.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within 1 year after percutaneous coronary intervention, more than 20% of patients experience new adverse events. Physical activity confers a 25% reduction in mortality; however, physical activity is widely underused. Thus, there is a need for more powerful behavioral interventions to promote physical activity. Our objective was to motivate patients to achieve an increase in expenditure of 336 kcal/wk or more at 12 months as assessed by the Paffenbarger Physical Activity and Exercise Index.
AB  - METHODS: Two hundred forty-two patients were recruited immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention between October 2004 and October 2006. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. The patient education (PE) control group (n = 118) (1) received an educational workbook, (2) received a pedometer, and (3) set a behavioral contract for a physical activity goal. The positive-affect/self-affirmation (PA) intervention group (n = 124) received the 3 PE control components plus (1) a PA workbook chapter, (2) bimonthly induction of PA by telephone, and (3) small mailed gifts. All patients were contacted with standardized bimonthly telephone follow-up for 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Attrition was 4.5%, and 2.1% of patients died. Significantly more patients in the PA intervention group increased expenditure by 336 kcal/wk or more at 12 months, our main outcome, compared with the PE control group (54.9% vs 37.4%, P = .007). The PA intervention patients were 1.7 times more likely to reach the goal of a 336-kcal/wk or more increase by 12 months, controlling for demographic and psychosocial measures. In multivariate analysis, the PA intervention patients had nearly double the improvement in kilocalories per week at 12 months compared with the PE control patients (602 vs 328, P = .03).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients who receive PA intervention after percutaneous coronary intervention are able to achieve a sustained and clinically significant increase in physical activity by 12 months. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00248846.

TI  - Symptoms of depression and anxiety and adherence to antihypertensive medication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to drug treatment is a major contributor to antihypertensive treatment failure. Mood disorders could impair the patient's desire and ability to follow physician's recommendations. We evaluated the role of symptoms of depression and anxiety on adherence to antihypertensive drug treatment.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal cohort study in 20-70 years old patients starting antihypertensive drug treatment, without other chronic conditions, and not taking mood-modifying drugs. Severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety were evaluated at enrollment and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of follow-up, using the Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) and the psychological general well-being index (PGWB), respectively. Treatment adherence was measured by pill count. Nonadherence was defined as taking <80% of the prescribed number of pills. Poisson regression was used to model the association of the exposures with adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: We enrolled 178 patients (58% male; mean age: 50 years; 508 follow-up visits). The risk of nonadherence was 52.6% in 12 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 46.1, 59.1). After adjusting for other risk factors, individuals with at least mild depression (BDI-II >14) and those with at least mild anxiety (PGWB anxiety score <22) were 2.48 (95% CI: 1.47, 4.18) and 1.59 (95% CI: 0.99, 2.56) times more likely to become nonadherent in the following 3 months, respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with at least mild anxiety and depression symptoms are at increased risk of becoming nonadherent to antihypertensive medication. Screening for depression and anxiety symptoms could be used to identify high-risk patients. Further evidence is needed to elucidate whether interventions targeting these conditions improve adherence.

TI  - Comparison of associations of adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet with risks of cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) share some risk factors, including obesity, but it is unclear how dietary patterns associated with reduced risk of CVD relate to risk of VTE.
AB  - OBJECTIVE:  To compare the relationships of adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet with the risks of CVD and VTE.
AB  - PATIENTS/METHODS: We confirmed by medical record review 1094 incident cases of CVD and 675 incident VTEs during a mean follow-up of 14.6 years in 34 827 initially healthy participants in the Women's Health Study who completed at baseline a 133-item food frequency questionnaire scored for adherence to a DASH diet. We compared estimated associations of dietary patterns with CVD and VTE from proportional hazards models in a competing risk framework.
AB  - RESULTS: Initial analyses adjusted for age, energy intake and randomized treatments showed 36-41% reduced hazards of CVD among women in the top two quintiles of DASH score relative to those in the bottom quintile (P(trend) < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, women in the top two quintiles had 12-23% reduced hazards of CVD relative to women in the bottom quintile (P(trend) = 0.04). Analyses restricted to coronary events showed more variable 10-33% reduced hazards in the top two quintiles (P(trend) = 0.09). In contrast, higher DASH scores were unrelated to risk of VTE, with a 1% reduced hazard for the top vs. bottom quintile (P(trend) = 0.95).
AB  - CONCLUSION: An apparently strong association of adherence to the DASH diet with incidence of CVD was attenuated upon control for confounding variables. Adherence to the DASH diet was not associated with risk of VTE in women.Copyright © 2011 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

TI  - Baseline medication adherence and blood pressure in a 24-month longitudinal hypertension study.
AB  - AIM AND OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify the feasibility and predictive validity of an easy and quick self-reported measure of medication adherence and to identify characteristics of people with hypertension that may warrant increase attentiveness by nurses to address hypertensive self-management needs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current control rates of hypertension are approximately 50%. Effective blood pressure control can be achieved in most people with hypertension through antihypertensive medication. However, hypertension control can only be achieved if the patient is adherent with their medication regimen. Patients who are non-adherent may be in need of additional intervention.
AB  - DESIGN: This secondary analysis evaluated the systolic blood pressure of patients who received usual hypertension management across 24 months at six-month intervals.
AB  - METHODS: A longitudinal study of 159 hypertensive patients in two primary care clinics.
AB  - RESULTS: In a sample of 159 patients receiving care in a primary care facility, baseline medication non-adherence was associated with a 6.3 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05) at baseline, a 8.4 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05) at 12 months and a 7.5 increase in systolic blood pressure at 24 months (p < 0.05) compared with adherent patients, respectively. Results also indicate a significant increase in systolic blood pressure across 24 months among people who identified as minority and of low financial status.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence with antihypertensive medication at baseline was predictive of increased systolic blood pressure up to 24 months postbaseline.
AB  - RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study demonstrates the use of an easy-to-use questionnaire to identify patients who are non-adherent. We recommend assessing medication adherence to identify patients who are non-adherent with their anti-hypertensive medication and to be especially vigilant with patients who are minority or are considered low income.Copyright © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Effect of a physician uncertainty reduction intervention on blood pressure in uncontrolled hypertensives--a cluster randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical inertia, provider failure to appropriately intensify treatment, is a major contributor to uncontrolled blood pressure (BP). Some clinical inertia may result from physician uncertainty over the patient's usual BP, adherence, or value of continuing efforts to control BP through lifestyle changes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that providing physicians with uncertainty reduction tools, including 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, electronic bottle cap monitoring, and lifestyle assessment and counseling, will lead to improved BP control.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial with five intervention clinics (IC) and five usual care clinics (UCC).
AB  - SETTING: Six public and 4 private primary care clinics.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 665 patients (63 percent African American) with uncontrolled hypertension (BP >140 mmHg/90 mmHg or >130/80 mmHg if diabetic).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: An order form for uncertainty reduction tools was placed in the IC participants' charts before each visit and results fed back to the provider.
AB  - OUTCOME MEASURES: Percent with controlled BP at last visit. Secondary outcome was BP changes from baseline.
AB  - RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 24 months. IC physicians intensified treatment in 81% of IC patients compared to 67% in UCC (p<0.001); 35.0% of IC patients and 31.9% of UCC patients achieved control at the last recorded visit (p>0.05). Multi-level mixed effects longitudinal regression modeling of SBP and DBP indicated a significant, non-linear slope difference favoring IC (p (time x group interaction)=0.048 for SBP and p=0.001 for DBP). The model-predicted difference attributable to intervention was -2.8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP by month 24, and -6.5 mmHg for both SBP and DBP by month 36.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The uncertainty reduction intervention did not achieve the pre-specified dichotomous outcome, but led to lower measured BP in IC patients.

TI  - Combination therapy as initial treatment for newly diagnosed hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends that clinicians consider the use of multidrug therapy to increase likelihood of achieving blood pressure goal. Little is known about recent patterns of combination antihypertensive therapy use in patients being initiated on hypertension treatment.
AB  - METHODS: We investigated combination antihypertensive therapy use in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients from the Cardiovascular Research Network Hypertension Registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between combination antihypertensive therapy and 12-month blood pressure control.
AB  - RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2007, a total of 161,585 patients met criteria for incident hypertension and were initiated on treatment. During the study period, an increasing proportion of patients were treated initially with combination rather than with single-agent therapy (20.7% in 2002 compared with 35.8% in 2007, P < .001). This increase in combination therapy use was more pronounced in patients with stage 2 hypertension, whose combination therapy use increased from 21.6% in 2002 to 44.5% in 2007. Nearly 90% of initial combination therapy was accounted for by 2 combinations, a thiazide and a potassium-sparing diuretic (47.6%) and a thiazide and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (41.4%). After controlling for relevant clinical factors, including subsequent intensification of treatment and medication adherence, combination therapy was associated with increased odds of blood pressure control at 12 months (odds ratio compared with single-drug initial therapy 1.20; 95% CI 1.15-1.24, P < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Initial treatment of hypertension with combination therapy is increasingly common and is associated with better long-term blood pressure control.Copyright © 2011 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Low medication adherence and the incidence of stroke symptoms among individuals with hypertension: the REGARDS study.
AB  - The authors analyzed data on 9950 participants taking antihypertensive medications in the nationwide Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study to determine the association between medication adherence and incident stroke symptoms. Medication adherence was assessed using a validated 4-item self-report scale and participants were categorized into 4 groups (scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 or 4, with higher scores indicating worse adherence). The incidence of 6 stroke symptoms (sudden weakness on one side of the body, numbness, painless loss of vision in one or both eyes, loss of half vision, losing the ability to understand people, and losing the ability to express oneself verbally or in writing) was assessed via telephone interviews every 6 months. During a median of 4 years, the incidence of any stroke symptom was 14.6%, 17.9%, 20.2%, and 24.9% among participants with adherence scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 or 4, respectively (P<.001). The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for any stroke symptom associated with adherence scores of 1, 2, and 3 or 4, vs 0, was 1.20 (1.04-1.39), 1.23 (0.94-1.60), and 1.59 (1.08-2.33), respectively (P<.001). Worse adherence was also associated with higher multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for each of the 6 stroke symptoms.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - A randomized trial to improve patient-centered care and hypertension control in underserved primary care patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: African Americans and persons with low socioeconomic status (SES) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and receive less patient-centered care than less vulnerable patient populations. Moreover, continuing medical education (CME) and patient-activation interventions have infrequently been directed to improve the processes of care for these populations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of patient-centered interventions targeting patients and physicians with the effectiveness of minimal interventions for underserved groups.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted from January 2002 through August 2005, with patient follow-up at 3 and 12 months, in 14 urban, community-based practices in Baltimore, Maryland.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one primary care physicians and 279 hypertension patients.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Physician communication skills training and patient coaching by community health workers.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Physician communication behaviors; patient ratings of physicians' participatory decision-making (PDM), patient involvement in care (PIC), reported adherence to medications; systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and BP control.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Visits of trained versus control group physicians demonstrated more positive communication change scores from baseline (-0.52 vs. -0.82, p = 0.04). At 12 months, the patient+physician intensive group compared to the minimal intervention group showed significantly greater improvements in patient report of physicians' PDM (beta = +6.20 vs. -5.24, p = 0.03) and PIC dimensions related to doctor facilitation (beta = +0.22 vs. -0.17, p = 0.03) and information exchange (beta = +0.32 vs. -0.22, p = 0.005). Improvements in patient adherence and BP control did not differ across groups for the overall patient sample. However, among patients with uncontrolled hypertension at baseline, non-significant reductions in systolic BP were observed among patients in all intervention groups-the patient+physician intensive (-13.2 mmHg), physician intensive/patient minimal (-10.6 mmHg), and the patient intensive/physician minimal (-16.8 mmHg), compared to the patient+physician minimal group (-2.0 mmHg).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Interventions that enhance physicians' communication skills and activate patients to participate in their care positively affect patient-centered communication, patient perceptions of engagement in care, and may improve systolic BP among urban African-American and low SES patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - Sustained blood pressure control following discontinuation of a pharmacist intervention.
AB  - Team-based care can improve hypertension control. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate blood pressure (BP) control 18 months following the discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention. This was a retrospective analysis of patients who had previously participated in a prospective, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial. Six community-based family medicine offices were randomized to control or intervention groups. Research nurses measured BPs using an automated device during the prospective trial. The research nurses then abstracted data from medical records, including BPs, medications, changes in therapy, and laboratory values for 18 months following the discontinuation of the 6-month prospective trial. The study included 228 patients in the control (n = 146) or intervention (n = 82) groups. The control group contained more patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (P < .013), were older (P = .047), and had more coexisting conditions (P < .001) than the intervention group. Systolic BP 9 months following discontinuation of the physician-pharmacist intervention was 137.2 +/- 18.2 mm Hg and 129.8 +/- 13.3 mm Hg in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = .0015). BP control was maintained in 61 (41.8%) control patients and 55 (67.1%) intervention patients (P = .0003). At 18 months post-intervention, systolic BP was 138.1 +/- 20.4 mm Hg and 130.0 +/- 16.0 mm Hg in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = .023). BP control was maintained in 53 (36.3%) control patients and 55 (67.1%) intervention patients at 18 months post-intervention (P < .0001). A sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the uneven distribution of patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, and the differences between groups were still significant. BP control rates remained significantly higher following a physician-pharmacist intervention compared with usual care for 18 months after discontinuation of the intervention. This model has the potential value as a useful long-term strategy to benefit patients with hypertension.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Effects of daily adherence to antihypertensive medication on blood pressure control.
AB  - Clinicians are often uncertain about how to manage elevated blood pressure (BP) when a patient reports that he/she has recently missed several doses of antihypertensive medications. While we know that better adherence can improve BP during several months, the magnitude of this relationship in the short term is poorly understood. The authors examined this issue using a group of patients who monitored adherence using a Medication Events Monitoring System (MEMS) cap and had BP measurements in the course of routine clinical practice. BP readings were compared following 7 days of excellent adherence (100%) or poor adherence (< 60%), omitting BP values following intermediate adherence. Using several different methods, BP following 7 days of excellent adherence was between 12/7 mm Hg and 15/8 mm Hg lower than after 7 days of poor adherence. Clinicians can use this effect size to calibrate their impressions of what the BP might have been with improved adherence.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Biomarkers for cognitive aging part II: oxidative stress, cognitive assessments, and medication adherence.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to further examine potential biomarkers of cognitive aging by looking at the associations among oxidative stress, cognitive abilities, and medication adherence in a community-based sample of middle-aged and older adults (n = 42; mean age = 69 years) prescribed at least one medication for hypertension. In addition to measures described in Part I, "Biomarkers for Cognitive Aging," a 12-hr urine collection for F(2)-isoprostanes served as an indicator of oxidative stress. Participants completed a battery of cognitive assessments and 8 weeks of electronic medication monitoring for adherence to one antihypertensive agent. Oxidative stress was significantly associated with logical memory, immediate (r = -.38, p < .01) and delayed recall (r = -.42, p < .01), and recognition memory (r = -.42, p < .01) from the Wechsler Memory Scale III, number of perseveration errors (r = .26, p < .05) and categories achieved (r = -.26, p < .01) on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WSCT), and medication adherence (r = -.34, p <.05). Findings indicate that a biomarker of oxidative stress, F(2)-isoprostanes corrected for vitamin E, is significantly associated with cognitive measures and a functional outcome.

TI  - Limitations of analyses based on achieved blood pressure: lessons from the African American study of kidney disease and hypertension trial.
AB  - Blood pressure (BP) guidelines that set target BP levels often rely on analyses of achieved BP from hypertension treatment trials. The objective of this article was to compare the results of analyses of achieved BP to intention-to-treat analyses on renal disease progression. Participants (n=1094) in the African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Trial were randomly assigned to either usual BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of 102 to 107 mm Hg or lower BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of <92 mm Hg. Median follow-up was 3.7 years. Primary outcomes were rate of decline in measured glomerular filtration rate and a composite of a decrease in glomerular filtration rate by >50% or >25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), requirement for dialysis, transplantation, or death. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no evidence of a BP effect on either the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate or the clinical composite outcome. In contrast, the achieved BP analyses showed that each 10-mm Hg increment in mean follow-up achieved mean arterial pressure was associated with a 0.35 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.62 mL/min per 1.73 m(2); P=0.01) faster mean glomerular filtration rate decline and a 17% (95% CI: 5% to 32%; P=0.006) increased risk of the clinical composite outcome. Analyses based on achieved BP lead to markedly different inferences than traditional intention-to-treat analyses, attributed in part to confounding of achieved BP with comorbidities, disease severity, and adherence. Clinicians and policy makers should exercise caution when making treatment recommendations based on analyses relating outcomes to achieved BP.

TI  - Device-guided paced respiration as an adjunctive therapy for hypertension in obstructive sleep apnea: a pilot feasibility study.
AB  - Data suggest that device-guided paced respiration (<10 breaths/min) may reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients. We hypothesized that daily device-guided slow breathing may lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In this one-arm pilot study, we enrolled 25 subjects with hypertension and OSA. Subjects were asked to perform device-guided paced respiration 30 min a day for 8 weeks. Our primary outcome was change in office systolic and diastolic blood pressures from baseline to 8 weeks. Twenty-four subjects completed the study. Mean baseline blood pressure was 140.0 +/- 10.2 mmHg systolic and 82.7 +/- 8.9 mmHg diastolic. Complete device data were available for 17 subjects. Mean device adherence was 81 +/- 24% and 51% achieved a mean breath rate <10 breaths/min over 8 weeks. Three subjects had changes in their anti-hypertensive medications during the study. Among the remaining 21 subjects, mean difference in office blood pressure from baseline to 8 weeks was -9.6 +/- 11.8 mmHg systolic (p < 0.01) and -2.52 +/- 8.9 mmHg diastolic (p = 0.21). Device-guided paced respiration may lower systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension and OSA; however, our findings need to be confirmed with larger randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Randomized, controlled trial of an intervention to enable stroke survivors throughout the Los Angeles County safety net to "stay with the guidelines".
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. Inpatient programs optimize secondary stroke prevention care at the time of hospital discharge, but such care may not be continued after hospital discharge.
AB  - METHODS: To improve the delivery of secondary stroke preventive services after hospital discharge, we have designed a chronic care model-based program called SUSTAIN (Systemic Use of STroke Averting INterventions). This care intervention includes group clinics, self-management support, report cards, decision support through care guides and protocols, and coordination of ongoing care. The first specific aim is to test, in a randomized, controlled trial, whether SUSTAIN improves blood pressure control among an analytic sample of 268 patients with a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack discharged from 4 Los Angeles County public hospitals. Secondary outcomes consist of control of other stroke risk factors, lifestyle habits, medication adherence, patient perceptions of care quality, functional status, and quality of life. A second specific aim is to conduct a cost analysis of SUSTAIN from the perspective of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services by using direct costs of the intervention, cost equivalents of associated utilization of county system resources, and cost equivalents of the observed and predicted averted vascular events.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: If SUSTAIN is effective, we will have the expertise and findings to advocate for its continued support at Los Angeles County hospitals and to disseminate the SUSTAIN program to other settings serving indigent, minority populations.

TI  - Study protocol: the Adherence and Intensification of Medications (AIM) study--a cluster randomized controlled effectiveness study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with diabetes have poor blood pressure (BP) control. Pharmacological therapy is the cornerstone of effective BP treatment, yet there are high rates both of poor medication adherence and failure to intensify medications. Successful medication management requires an effective partnership between providers who initiate and increase doses of effective medications and patients who adhere to the regimen.
AB  - METHODS: In this cluster-randomized controlled effectiveness study, primary care teams within sites were randomized to a program led by a clinical pharmacist trained in motivational interviewing-based behavioral counseling approaches and authorized to make BP medication changes or to usual care. This study involved the collection of data during a 14-month intervention period in three Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and two Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities. The clinical pharmacist was supported by clinical information systems that enabled proactive identification of, and outreach to, eligible patients identified on the basis of poor BP control and either medication refill gaps or lack of recent medication intensification. The primary outcome is the relative change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements over time. Secondary outcomes are changes in Hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), medication adherence determined from pharmacy refill data, and medication intensification rates.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Integration of the three intervention elements--proactive identification, adherence counseling and medication intensification--is essential to achieve optimal levels of control for high-risk patients. Testing the effectiveness of this intervention at the team level allows us to study the program as it would typically be implemented within a clinic setting, including how it integrates with other elements of care.

TI  - Intergenerational transmission of chronic illness self-care: results from the caring for hypertension in African American families study.
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: African Americans often experience early onset of hypertension that can result in generations of adults managing high blood pressure concurrently. Using a model based on the Theory of Interdependence, this study examined whether intergenerational transmission of hypertension knowledge and self-efficacy would affect hypertension self-care of older parents and their adult children.
AB  - DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 95 African American older parent-adult child dyads with hypertension. We constructed separate logistic regression models for older parents and adult children with medication adherence as the outcome. Each model included individual demographic and health characteristics, the partner's knowledge, and self-efficacy to manage hypertension and dyad-related characteristics.
AB  - RESULTS: Parents were more adherent with medication than adult children (67.4% vs. 49.5%, p < .012). There were no significant factors associated with parent medication adherence. In adjusted models for adult children, medication adherence was associated with child's gender (odds ratio [OR] = 3.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26-8.59), parent beliefs that the child had better hypertension self-care (OR = 4.36, 95% CI = 1.34-14.17), and child reports that the dyad conversed about hypertension (OR = 3.48, 95% CI = 1.18-10.29). Parental knowledge of hypertension and parent's self-efficacy were weakly associated with adult children's medication adherence (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 0.99-1.84 and OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 0.94-7.12, respectively).
AB  - IMPLICATIONS: Interventions should consider targeting African American older adults to increase self-care knowledge and empower them as a primary influencer of hypertension self-care within the family.

TI  - Trust in physicians and blood pressure control in blacks and whites being treated for hypertension in the REGARDS study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Among persons treated for hypertension, Blacks are more likely to have uncontrolled blood pressure compared to Whites. Few studies have focused on trust in physicians as a potential contributor to this disparity in blood pressure (BP) control. The primary objective of this study was to assess the relationship between trust in physicians and blood pressure control among Blacks and Whites being treated for hypertension.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data collected from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke cohort, a US national, population-based cohort study. Participants were recruited by telephone from 2003-2007, completed a telephone survey, and had BP measured during an in-home visit.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 2843 Black and White adults aged > 45 years with treated hypertension.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uncontrolled blood pressure was defined as systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg. For participants with diabetes, renal disease, or self-reported previous myocardial infarction, uncontrolled blood pressure was defined as systolic blood pressure > 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 80 mm Hg.
AB  - RESULTS: Trust in physicians was not associated with uncontrolled blood pressure in either unadjusted (odd ratio [OR] 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI) 0.92, 1.25) or adjusted analyses (OR 0.97; 0.83, 1.14). Both Black race (OR 1.58; 1.36, 1.84) and imperfect medication adherence (OR 1.56; 1.31,1.86) were associated with higher odds of uncontrolled blood pressure.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Trust in physicians was not related to blood pressure control among Blacks and Whites with treated hypertension in this sample. The racial disparity in blood pressure control was not completely explained by trust in physicians or medication adherence, and a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to this disparity is needed.

TI  - Rationale and design of a randomized trial to evaluate an evidence-based prescription drug label on actual medication use.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication errors are an important public health concern, and poor understanding of medication labels are a root cause. Research shows that labels are variable, of poor quality, and not patient-centered. No real-world trials have evaluated whether improved medication labels can affect appropriate medication use, adherence or health outcomes.
AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: We developed an evidence-based prescription label that addresses both content and format. The enhanced label includes a universal medication schedule (UMS) that standardizes the directions for use incorporating 1) standard time periods for administration (morning, noon, evening, and bedtime), 2) numeric vs. alpha characters, 3) 'carriage returns' to separate daily dose and 4) a graphic aid to visually depict dose and frequency. We will evaluate the effect of providing this label to randomly sampled patients who receive their care from free clinics, mobile vans and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in Northern Virginia. We will recruit patients with diabetes or hypertension; these patients will be randomly assigned to receive all of their medications with improved labels or to receive prescriptions with standard labels. The primary outcome will be the patient's ability to correctly demonstrate dosing instructions. Other outcomes include adherence, error rates and health outcomes.
AB  - CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this trial is the first to evaluate the effect of prescription label improvement on understanding, medication use and outcomes in a clinical setting. If successful, these findings could be implemented broadly to promote safe and appropriate medication use and to support evidence-based standards in the development of labels.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Low medication adherence and hypertension control among adults with CKD: data from the REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low adherence to antihypertensive medication is an important barrier to achieving blood pressure control. Few data are available for medication adherence in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
AB  - SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 3,936 and 9,129 participants with and without CKD using antihypertensive medication in the REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) Study, respectively. CKD was defined as albuminuria with albumin excretion>or=30 mg/g or estimated glomerular filtration rate<60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
AB  - OUTCOMES: Medication adherence and uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Medication adherence was assessed using a validated 4-item scale. Blood pressure was measured 2 times by trained staff.
AB  - RESULTS: In REGARDS participants with and without CKD, 1,426 (36.2%) and 2,421 (26.5%) had uncontrolled hypertension with blood pressure>or=140/90 mm Hg, and 2,656 (67.5%) and 5,627 (61.6%), >or=130/80 mm Hg. Also, 27.7% of those with CKD and 27.9% of those without CKD responded "yes" to ever forgetting to take their medication and 4.4% and 4.2%, respectively, responded yes to being careless about taking their medication. Also, 5.7% and 5.3% responded yes to missing taking medication when they felt better, and 4.2% and 3.6%, to missing it when they felt sick. Overall, 23.3% and 23.7% of participants with and without CKD responded yes to 1 adherence question, whereas 7.7% and 7.2%, respectively, responded yes to 2 or more adherence questions. In those with CKD, the multivariable adjusted ORs for uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure>or=140/90 mm Hg) for individuals answering yes to 1 and 2 or more versus 0 adherence questions were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.05-1.51) and 1.49 (95% CI, 1.12-1.98), respectively. Analogous ORs for systolic/diastolic blood pressure>or=130/80 mm Hg were 1.06 (95% CI, 0.78-1.45) and 1.20 (95% CI, 0.88-1.64).
AB  - LIMITATIONS: Pharmacy fill data were not available.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with CKD had similarly poor medication-taking behaviors as those without CKD.Copyright (c) 2010 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of self-efficacy and social support on adherence to antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between poor adherence and self-efficacy or social support after a pharmacist intervention.
AB  - DESIGN: Post-hoc analysis of data from two randomized controlled trials of physician-pharmacist collaborative interventions (6 and 9 mo, respectively) to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - SETTING: Eleven university-affiliated primary care clinics.
AB  - PATIENTS: Five hundred eighty-four patients (aged 21-85 yrs) with uncontrolled primary hypertension; 296 were in the intervention group and 288 were in the control group.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Pharmacists provided intensified hypertension management and drug adherence counseling to patients in the intervention group.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Social support and self-efficacy questionnaires were administered at baseline and end-of-study visits. Patient adherence was monitored by using the Morisky self-reported adherence questionnaire. Self-reported adherence scores improved significantly in the control group (p=0.0053) but not in the intervention group; however, adherence at baseline in both groups was high. There were small, but significant, improvements in self-efficacy (p<0.04) and social support (p<0.05) scores in the intervention group but not the control group at the end of the study. Social support and, to a lesser extent, self-efficacy improved as a function of duration of study participation (9-mo vs 6-mo intervention), regardless of whether the patient received the intervention. Blood pressure control in both groups improved significantly at the end of the study; however, mean blood pressure was significantly lower in the intervention group (129.7/76.6 mm Hg) compared with the control group (140.8/78.9 mm Hg; p<0.0001 for systolic, p=0.032 for diastolic).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Social support and self-efficacy improved significantly in the intervention group at the end of the pharmacist intervention. Drug adherence was correlated with self-efficacy even though drug adherence did not improve significantly in the intervention group. The fact that social support and self-efficacy improved as a function of duration of study participation suggests that participation in a research study may have had a positive influence on these measures. Even though the changes in social support, self-efficacy, and drug adherence were modest, there was significantly better blood pressure control in the intervention group compared with the control group. These findings indicate that changes in drug adherence, self-efficacy, or social support probably played a minor role in the blood pressure outcomes in these studies.

TI  - Vitamins C and E to prevent complications of pregnancy-associated hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress has been proposed as a mechanism linking the poor placental perfusion characteristic of preeclampsia with the clinical manifestations of the disorder. We assessed the effects of antioxidant supplementation with vitamins C and E, initiated early in pregnancy, on the risk of serious adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes related to pregnancy-associated hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial involving nulliparous women who were at low risk for preeclampsia. Women were randomly assigned to begin daily supplementation with 1000 mg of vitamin C and 400 IU of vitamin E or matching placebo between the 9th and 16th weeks of pregnancy. The primary outcome was severe pregnancy-associated hypertension alone or severe or mild hypertension with elevated liver-enzyme levels, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum creatinine levels, eclamptic seizure, medically indicated preterm birth, fetal-growth restriction, or perinatal death.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 10,154 women underwent randomization. The two groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics and adherence to the study drug. Outcome data were available for 9969 women. There was no significant difference between the vitamin and placebo groups in the rates of the primary outcome (6.1% and 5.7%, respectively; relative risk in the vitamin group, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.25) or in the rates of preeclampsia (7.2% and 6.7%, respectively; relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.24). Rates of adverse perinatal outcomes did not differ significantly between the groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C and E supplementation initiated in the 9th to 16th week of pregnancy in an unselected cohort of low-risk, nulliparous women did not reduce the rate of adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes related to pregnancy-associated hypertension (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00135707).Copyright 2010 Massachusetts Medical Society

TI  - Deterioration of blood pressure control after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess blood pressure control after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention.
AB  - DESIGN: Comparative analysis of data of the patients who received the intervention versus a control group from a prospective, cluster-randomized, 9-month efficacy trial and the same patients' data 18 and 27 months after completion of the trial, abstracted from their medical records.
AB  - SETTING: Five primary care medical offices operated by a university health system.
AB  - PATIENTS: One hundred four patients with hypertension; 65 were in the intervention group, and 39 were in the control group.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the prospective study, patients were randomized to receive a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention to improve blood pressure control or to the control group. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured by a research nurse at baseline and at the end of the study (9 mo later). In the current study, data were abstracted for blood pressure and blood pressure control at 18 and 27 months (9 and 18 mo, respectively, after discontinuation of the study). At baseline, mean +/- SD systolic blood pressure was 152.5 +/- 9.5 and 150.1 +/- 9.6 mm Hg in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p=0.22). At 9 months, systolic blood pressure decreased to 124.5 +/- 10.7 and 132.0 +/- 15.1 mm Hg (p=0.0038 between groups), and blood pressure was controlled in 78.5% and 48.7% (p=0.0017) of patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively. By 18 months, systolic blood pressure had deteriorated to 131.0 +/- 12.2 and 143.3 +/- 17.5 mm Hg (p<0.001), and blood pressure control rates decreased to 53.9% and 30.8% (p=0.02). By 27 months, systolic blood pressure was 131.3 +/- 13.0 and 141.2 +/- 15.8 mm Hg (p=0.0008), and blood pressure control was 55.4% and 35.9% (p=0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: A sustained positive effect on blood pressure control was noted up to 18 months after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention, when compared with a control group. Blood pressure control did deteriorate at a similar rate in both the intervention and control groups, but the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure remained significantly higher in the intervention group. These results suggest that continued interventions by pharmacists may be necessary to maintain high rates of blood pressure control, especially in those patients whose blood pressure begins to increase.

TI  - The association of patient-physician gender concordance with cardiovascular disease risk factor control and treatment in diabetes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gender concordance between patients and their physicians is related to prevention screening and other quality indicators. Research suggests female physicians may place greater emphasis on preventive care than male physicians; however, little is known about whether physician gender and patient-physician gender concordance are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor levels and treatment. Our objective was to examine associations between patient gender, physician gender, and their interaction with CVD risk factor control, medication adherence, and treatment intensification in diabetes.
AB  - METHODS: In this study, 157,458 Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult diabetes patients with a primary care physician (PCP) were assessed for above target levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (>or=8%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (>or=100 mg/dL), and systolic blood pressure (SBP>or=130 mm Hg) in 2005. Medication adherence and appropriate CVD treatment intensification were assessed using pharmacy data. Probit models assessed the adjusted marginal effects of patient gender, PCP gender, and their interaction on control, adherence, and intensification.
AB  - RESULTS: Female patients had lower adjusted rates of LDL-C (46% vs. 55%, p<0.001) and SBP control (52% vs. 60%, p<0.001) than males. Female patients of female PCPs had the highest adjusted rates of HbA1c control of the four patient-physician gender dyads (70% vs. 66%-68%, p<0.05). Male patients were more likely than female patients to receive treatment intensification for high SBP (60% vs. 57%, p<0.001). Female PCPs were more likely than their male counterparts to intensify therapy for hyperlipidemia and hypertension.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patient and physician gender and gender concordance are modestly associated with CVD risk factor control and treatment in diabetes. Further understanding of these differences could lead to improved CVD outcomes for women.

TI  - Hypertension telemanagement in blacks.
AB  - We propose evaluation of a multi-component home automated telemanagement system providing integrated support to both clinicians and patients in implementing hypertension treatment guidelines. In a randomized clinical study, 550 blacks with hypertension are followed for 18 months. The major components of the intervention and control groups are identical and are based on the current standard of care. For the purpose of this study, we define "standard of care" as the expected evidence-based care provided according to the current hypertension treatment guidelines. Although intervention and control groups are similar in terms of their care components, they differ in the mode of care delivery. For the control group the best attempt is made to deliver all components of a guideline-concordant care in a routine clinical environment whereas for the intervention group the routine clinical environment is enhanced with health information technology that assists clinicians and patients in working together in implementing treatment guidelines. The home automated telemanagement system guides patients in following their individualized treatment plans and helps care coordination team in monitoring the patient progress. The study design is aimed at addressing the main question of this trial: whether the addition of the information technology-enhanced care coordination in the routine primary care setting can improve delivery of evidence-based hypertension care in blacks. The outcome parameters include quality of life, medical care use, treatment compliance, psychosocial variables, and improvement in blood pressure control rates. The trial will provide insight on the potential impact of information technology-enhanced care coordination in blacks with poorly controlled hypertension.

TI  - The Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) trial: pharmacy interventions to improve hypertension control in blacks.
AB  - Recent studies suggest that involving pharmacists is an effective strategy for improving patient adherence and blood pressure (BP) control. To date, few controlled studies have tested the cost-effectiveness of specific models for improving patient adherence and BP control in community pharmacies, where most Americans obtain prescriptions. We hypothesized that a team model of adherence monitoring and intervention in corporately owned community pharmacies can improve patient adherence, prescribing, and BP control among hypertensive black patients. The Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) Trial is a randomized controlled trial testing a multistep intervention for improving adherence monitoring and intervention in 28 corporately owned community pharmacies. Patients in the 14 control pharmacies received "usual care," and patients in the 14 intervention pharmacies received TEAM Care by trained pharmacists and pharmacy technicians working with patients and physicians. Data collectors screened 1250 patients and enrolled 597 hypertensive black patients. The primary end points were the proportion of patients achieving BP control and reductions in systolic and diastolic BP measured after 6 and 12 months. Secondary end points were changes in adherence monitoring and intervention, patient adherence and barriers to adherence, prescribing, and cost-effectiveness. Researchers also will examine potential covariates and barriers to change. Involving pharmacists is a potentially powerful means of improving BP control in blacks. Pharmacists are in an excellent position to monitor patients between clinic visits and to provide useful information to patients and physicians.

TI  - Does reducing physician uncertainty improve hypertension control?: rationale and methods.
AB  - Hypertension affects nearly one third of the US population overall, and the prevalence rises sharply with age. In spite of public educational campaigns and professional education programs to encourage blood pressure measurement and control of both systolic and diastolic control to <140/90 mm Hg (or 130/80 mm Hg if diabetic), 43% of treated hypertensives do not achieve the recommended Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure target. Among blacks, 48% are uncontrolled on treatment. The majority of persons classified as poorly controlled hypertensives have mild systolic blood pressure elevation (in the range of 140 to 160 mm Hg). We hypothesized that physician uncertainty regarding the patient's usual blood pressure, as well as uncertainty regarding the extent of medication nonadherence, represent an important barrier to further reductions in the proportion of uncontrolled hypertensives in the United States. Using cluster randomization, 10 primary care clinics (6 from a public health care system and 4 from a private clinic system) were randomized to either the uncertainty reduction intervention condition or to usual care. An average of 68 patients per clinic were recruited to serve as units of observation. Physicians in the 5 intervention clinics were provided with a specially designed study form that included a graph of recent blood pressure measurements in their study patients, a check box to indicate their assessment of the adequacy of the patient's blood pressure control, and a menu of services they could order to aid in patient management. These menu options included 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; electronic bottle cap assessment of medication adherence, followed by medication adherence counseling in patients found to be nonadherent; and lifestyle assessment and counseling followed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Physicians in the 5 usual practice clinics did not have access to these services but were informed of which patients had been enrolled in the study. Substudies carried out to further characterize the study population and interpret intervention results included ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and electronic bottle cap monitoring in a random subsample of patients at baseline, and audio recording of patient-physician encounters after intervention implementation. The primary study end point was defined as the proportion of patients with controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg or <130/80 mm Hg if diabetic). Secondary end points include actual measured clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, patient physician communication patterns, physician prescribing patient self-reported lifestyle and medication adherence, physician knowledge, attitude and beliefs regarding the utility of intervention tools to achieve blood pressure control, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Six-hundred eighty patients have been randomized, and 675 remain in active follow-up after 1.5 years. Patient closeout will be complete in March 2009. Analyses of the baseline data are in progress. Office-based blood pressure measurement error and bias, as well as physician and patient beliefs about the need for treatment intensification, may be important factors that limit further progress in blood pressure control. This trial will provide data on the extent to which available technologies not widely used in primary care will change physician prescribing behavior and patient adherence to prescribed treatment.

TI  - Home-based blood pressure interventions for blacks.
AB  - Efforts to increase blood pressure (BP) control rates in blacks, a traditionally underserved high-risk population must address both provider practice and patient adherence issues. The home-based BP Intervention for blacks study is a 3-arm randomized controlled trial designed to test 2 strategies to improve hypertension management and outcomes in a decentralized service setting serving a vulnerable and complex home care population. The primary study outcomes are systolic BP, diastolic BP, and BP control; secondary outcomes are nurse adherence to hypertension management recommendations and patient adherence to medication, healthy diet, and other self-management strategies. Nurses (n=312) in a nonprofit Medicare-certified home health agency are randomized along with their eligible hypertensive patients (n=845). The 2 interventions being tested are (1) a "basic" intervention delivering key evidence-based reminders to home care nurses and patients while the patient is receiving traditional postacute home health care; and (2) an "augmented" intervention that includes that same as the basic intervention, plus transition to an ongoing Hypertension Home Support Program that extends support for 12 months. Outcomes are measured at 3 and 12 months after baseline interview. The interventions will be assessed relative to usual care and to each other. Systems change to improve BP management and outcomes in home health will not easily occur without new intervention models and rigorous evaluation of their impact. Results from this trial will provide important information on potential strategies to improve BP control in a low-income chronically ill patient population.

TI  - Physician and pharmacist collaboration to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated that blood pressure (BP) control can be improved when clinical pharmacists assist with patient management. The objective of this study was to evaluate if a physician and pharmacist collaborative model in community-based medical offices could improve BP control.
AB  - METHODS: This was a prospective, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial with clinics randomized to a control group (n = 3) or to an intervention group (n = 3). The study enrolled 402 patients (mean age, 58.3 years) with uncontrolled hypertension. Clinical pharmacists made drug therapy recommendations to physicians based on national guidelines. Research nurses performed BP measurements and 24-hour BP monitoring.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean (SD) guideline adherence scores increased from 49.4 (19.3) at baseline to 53.4 (18.1) at 6 months (8.1% increase) in the control group and from 40.4 (22.6) at baseline to 62.8 (13.5) at 6 months (55.4% increase) in the intervention group (P = .09 for adjusted between-group comparison). The mean BP decreased 6.8/4.5 mm Hg in the control group and 20.7/9.7 mm Hg in the intervention group (P < .05 for between-group systolic BP comparison). The adjusted difference in systolic BP was -12.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], -24.0 to 0.0) mm Hg, while the adjusted difference in diastolic BP was -1.8 (95% CI, -11.9 to 8.3) mm Hg. The 24-hour BP levels showed similar effect sizes. Blood pressure was controlled in 29.9% of patients in the control group and in 63.9% of patients in the intervention group (adjusted odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.0-5.1; P < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A physician and pharmacist collaborative intervention achieved significantly better mean BP and overall BP control rates compared with a control group. Additional research should be conducted to evaluate efficient strategies to implement team-based chronic disease management.

TI  - Constructing common cohorts from trials with overlapping eligibility criteria: implications for comparing effect sizes between trials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparing findings from separate trials is necessary to choose among treatment options, however differences among study cohorts may impede these comparisons.
AB  - PURPOSE: As a case study, to examine the overlap of study cohorts in two large randomized controlled clinical trials that assess interventions to reduce risk of major cardiovascular disease events in adults with type 2 diabetes in order to explore the feasibility of cross-trial comparisons
AB  - METHODS: The Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) and The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trials enrolled 5145 and 10,251 adults with type 2 diabetes, respectively. Look AHEAD assesses the efficacy of an intensive lifestyle intervention designed to produce weight loss; ACCORD tests pharmacological therapies for control of glycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Incidence of major cardiovascular disease events is the primary outcome for both trials. A sample was constructed to include participants from each trial who appeared to meet eligibility criteria and be appropriate candidates for the other trial's interventions. Demographic characteristics, health status, and outcomes of members and nonmembers of this constructed sample were compared.
AB  - RESULTS: Nearly 80% of Look AHEAD participants were projected to be ineligible for ACCORD; ineligibility was primarily due to better glycemic control or no early history of cardiovascular disease. Approximately 30% of ACCORD participants were projected to be ineligible for Look AHEAD, often for reasons linked to poorer health. The characteristics of participants projected to be jointly eligible for both trials continued to reflect differences between trials according to factors likely linked to retention, adherence, and study outcomes.
AB  - LIMITATIONS: Accurate ascertainment of cross-trial eligibility was hampered by differences between protocols.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Despite several similarities, the Look AHEAD and ACCORD cohorts represent distinct populations. Even within the subsets of participants who appear to be eligible and appropriate candidates for trials of both modes of intervention, differences remained. Direct comparisons of results from separate trials of lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions are compromised by marked differences in enrolled cohorts.

TI  - Are co-morbidities associated with guideline adherence? The MI-Plus study of Medicare patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The impact of co-morbid illnesses on adherence to guideline recommendations in chronic illness is of growing concern. We tested a framework [Piette and Kerr, Diabetes Care. 29(3):725-31, 2006] of provider adherence to guidelines in the presence of co-morbid conditions, which suggests that the effect of co-morbid conditions depends on treatment recommendations for the co-morbid conditions and how symptomatic they are.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted an exploratory analysis to assess the framework using chart audit data for 1,240 post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Medicare beneficiaries in Alabama. We assessed level of guideline-adherent post-AMI care from chart-based quality indicators and constructed scores reflecting how much care for the co-morbid condition was similar to post-AMI care (concordance) and how symptomatic the co-morbid condition is, based on expert opinion.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 74 years, mean co-morbidities of 2, and 61% were white. Both concordance and symptomatic scores were positively associated with guideline compliance, with correlations of 0.32 and 0.14, respectively (p < 0.001 for each). We found positive correlations between highly concordant co-morbid conditions and post-AMI quality scores and negative correlations between highly symptomatic conditions and post-AMI quality scores; both findings support the framework. However, the framework performed less well for conditions that were not highly concordant or highly symptomatic, and the magnitudes of the associations were not large.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The framework was related to the association of co-morbid conditions with adherence by providers to guideline-recommended treatment for post-AMI patients. The framework holds promise for evaluating and possibly predicting guideline adherence.

TI  - Perceived susceptibility to chronic kidney disease among high-risk patients seen in primary care practices.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients' views of their risk for the development or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are poorly characterized.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess perceived risk and concern regarding CKD development or progression among high-risk patients seen in primary care, identify predictors of perceptions, and correlate perceptions with adherence to high blood pressure management.
AB  - DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of 195 patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial on hypertension management in 40 Maryland primary care practices.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: We assessed independent predictors (sociodemographics, health literacy, clinical presence of CKD, co-morbid conditions, and health behaviors) of perceived susceptibility (assessed via questionnaire) and adherence (assessed via Hill-Bone blood pressure adherence scale) in multivariable analyses.
AB  - MAIN RESULTS: In this hypertensive majority African American (63%) population, many participants had uncontrolled blood pressure (44%) or diabetes (42%). Few (20%) felt "very likely" to develop CKD and one third (33%) were "very concerned" about developing CKD. Participants who were female and had low health literacy had lower perceived susceptibility to CKD compared to males and those with higher health literacy. Race and diabetes were also associated with perceived susceptibility. Greater perceived susceptibility was associated with poorer blood pressure management adherence scores.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Many high-risk patients have low perceived susceptibility to CKD. Poor blood pressure therapy adherence scores among those with greatest perceived susceptibility suggest fatalistic attitudes about CKD. If our findings are confirmed in larger studies, interventions targeting patient perceptions of CKD risk and other attitudes associated with these perceptions could impact adherence to therapies and health outcomes.

TI  - Influence of patient race on physician prescribing decisions: a randomized on-line experiment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior research reports black patients have lower medication use for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patient race influences physicians' prescribing.
AB  - DESIGN: Web-based survey including three clinical vignettes (hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes), with patient race (black, white) randomized across vignettes.
AB  - SUBJECTS: A total of 716 respondents from 5,141 eligible sampled primary care physicians (14% response rate).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: None
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Medication recommendation (any medication vs none, on-patent branded vs generic, and therapeutic class) and physicians' treatment adherence forecast (10-point Likert scale, 1-definitely not adhere, 10-definitely adhere).
AB  - RESULTS: Respondents randomized to view black patients (n = 371) and white patients (n = 345) recommend any medications at comparable rates for hypercholesterolemia (100.0% white vs 99.5% black, P = 0.50), hypertension (99.7% white vs 99.5% black, P = 1.00), and diabetes (99.7% white vs 99.7% black, P = 1.00). Patient race influenced medication class chosen in the hypertension vignette; respondents randomized to view black patients recommended calcium channel blockers more often (20.8% black vs 3.2% white) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors less often (47.4% black vs 62.6% white) (P < 0.001). Patient race did not influence medication class for hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Respondents randomized to view black patients reported lower forecasted patient adherence for hypertension (P < 0.001, mean: 7.3 black vs 7.7 white) and diabetes (P = 0.05 mean: 7.4 black vs 7.6 white), but race had no meaningful influence on forecasted adherence for hypercholesterolemia (P = 0.15, mean: 7.2 black vs 7.3 white).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Racial differences in outpatient prescribing patterns for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes are likely attributable to factors other than prescribing decisions based on patient race.

TI  - Intensifying therapy for hypertension despite suboptimal adherence.
AB  - More intensive management can improve control blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients. However, many would posit that treatment intensification (TI) is not beneficial in the face of suboptimal adherence. We investigated whether the effect of TI on BP varies by adherence. We enrolled 819 patients with hypertension, managed in primary care at an academically-affiliated inner-city hospital. We used the following formula to characterize TI: (visits with a medication change-visits with elevated BP)/total visits. Adherence was characterized using electronic monitoring devices ("MEMS caps"). Patients who returned their MEMS caps (671) were divided into quartiles of adherence, whereas patients who did not return their MEMS caps (148) had "missing" adherence. We examined the relationship between TI and the final systolic blood pressure (SBP), controlling for patient-level covariates. In the entire sample, each additional therapy increase per 10 visits predicted a 2.0 mm Hg decrease in final SBP (P<0.001). After stratifying by adherence, in the "best" adherence quartile each therapy increase predicted a 2.1-mm Hg decrease in final SBP, followed by 1.8 for the "next-best" adherence quartile, 2.3 in the third quartile, and 2.4 in the "worst" adherence quartile. The effect size for patients with "missing" adherence was 1.6 mm Hg. The differences between the group with "best" adherence and the other 4 groups were not statistically significant. In this observational study, treatment intensification was associated with similar BP improvement regardless of the patient's level of adherence. A randomized trial could further examine optimal management of patients with suboptimal adherence.

TI  - The effect of patient race and blood pressure control on patient-physician communication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in hypertension control contribute to higher rates of cardiovascular mortality among blacks. Patient-physician communication quality is associated with better health outcomes, including blood pressure (BP) control. Both race/ethnicity and BP control may adversely affect communication.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether being black and having poor BP control interact to adversely affect patient-physician communication more than either condition alone, a situation referred to as "double jeopardy."
AB  - DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study of enrollment data from a randomized controlled trial of interventions to enhance patient adherence to therapy for hypertension. Participants included 226 hypertensive patients and 39 physicians from 15 primary care practices in Baltimore, MD.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Communication behaviors and visit length from coding of audiotapes.
AB  - RESULTS: After controlling for patient and physician characteristics, blacks with uncontrolled BP have shorter visits (B = -3.9 min, p < 0.01) with less biomedical (B = -24.0, p = 0.05), psychosocial (B = -19.4, p < 0.01), and rapport-building (B = -19.5, p = 0.01) statements than whites with controlled BP. Of all communication outcomes, blacks with uncontrolled BP are only in "double jeopardy" for a patient positive affect-coders give them lower ratings than all other patients. Blacks with controlled BP also experience shorter visits and less communication with physicians than whites with controlled BP. There are no significant communication differences between the visits of whites with uncontrolled versus controlled BP.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that patient race is associated with the quality of patient-physician communication to a greater extent than BP control. Interventions that improve patient-physician communication should be tested as a strategy to reduce racial disparities in hypertension care and outcomes.

TI  - Adherence to the DASH Diet is inversely associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes: the insulin resistance atherosclerosis study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been widely promoted; however, little is known about its impact on type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We evaluated the association of the DASH diet with incidence of type 2 diabetes among 862 participants of the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) who completed a 1-year food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Type 2 diabetes odds ratios (ORs) were estimated at tertiles of the DASH score. RESULTS An inverse association was observed in whites (tertile 2 vs. tertile 1, OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.29-1.48]) that became significant for the most extreme contrast (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1, 0.31 [0.13-0.75]), with adjustment for covariates. No association was observed in blacks or Hispanics (tertile 2 vs. tertile 1, 1.16 [0.61-2.18 ]; tertile 3 vs. tertile 1, 1.34 [0.70-2.58 ]). CONCLUSIONS Adherence to the DASH dietary pattern, which is rich in vegetables, fruit, and low-fat dairy products, may have the potential to prevent type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Implementing a palm pilot intervention for primary care providers: lessons learned.
AB  - The Personal Digital Assistance for Guideline Adherence (GLAD Heart) study was designed to test a strategy to improve quality of care through increased adherence to ATPIII cholesterol guidelines. This paper describes the overall study design including the multi-faceted intervention and outcome measures. Sixty-one primary care practices in NC were recruited and randomized to either a personal digital assistant-based cholesterol management intervention or an intervention similar in intensity and frequency of contact but focused on a hypertension clinical practice guideline. Installation and implementation of the technology intervention was challenging. Over the course of the study, there were 74 technical issues requiring assistance for the palm pilot from 23 participating practices. The GLAD Heart project was completed successfully with some impact on cholesterol management. Technology has the potential to improve the quality of care provided in the healthcare setting. However, potentially expensive interventions such as that conducted in GLAD Heart should undergo rigorous testing to assure their efficacy before widespread adoption.

TI  - Rationale and design of the Study Assessing the Effect of Cardiovascular Medications Provided as Low-cost, Evidence-based Generic Samples (SAMPLES) trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Highly effective generic cardiovascular medications are frequently underused, leading to greater overall drug costs and cost-related nonadherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess an intervention to stimulate appropriate generic cardiovascular drug use without creating administrative or financial barriers that may impede essential medication use.
AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: The SAMPLES (Study Assessing the Effect of Cardiovascular Medications Provided as Low-cost, Evidence-based Generic Samples) trial is a clustered, randomized controlled trial of the effect of providing physicians with free generic samples of hydrochlorothiazide for hypertensive patients and simvastatin for patients with hyperlipidemia. We will randomize 660 primary care physicians in Pennsylvania, clustered by physician practice, to receive free samples for both conditions or to receive no samples. We will use data on filled prescriptions obtained from a state-sponsored prescription drug assistance program to perform an intention-to-treat evaluation of the impact of the intervention on physician prescribing behavior (proportion of prescriptions that are generic) and patient adherence. Secondary outcomes will include physician adherence to established guidelines and overall prescription drug costs.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This trial will define the potential role of an innovative approach to stimulate clinically appropriate cost-effective prescribing. We will determine whether free generic samples can reduce overall drug costs as well as out-of-pocket costs to the patient without sacrificing efficacy and whether this approach results in improved adherence to essential cardiovascular medications. This intervention may also improve adherence to practice guidelines and improve the quality of care received. If effective, this strategy could be used broadly by private insurers or government payers aiming to stimulate more cost-effective and higher-quality care.

TI  - Control of blood pressure in North Carolina primary care: baseline data from the GLAD Heart Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In general, adherence to blood pressure guidelines is low. We assessed whether hypertension recognition and control in North Carolina was consistent with the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) in primary care practices participating in a quality improvement study regarding the implementation of the ATP3 cholesterol management guideline in primary care in North Carolina (GLAD Heart).
AB  - METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from 5,073 charts (patients aged 21-84 years, seen from June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2003) at 60 practices. Sites were non-university based primary care practices from 22 North Carolina counties. A dyslipidemia screening was defined as a lipid profile performed when not on lipid-lowering therapy. Among patients receiving a lipid profile, the proportion with diagnosed, undiagnosed, and controlled hypertension, was calculated according to JNC 7 guidelines. Practice level hypertension control was examined using the median and interquartile range across practices.
AB  - RESULTS: Among 1,763 patients screened for dyslipidemia, 49.4% had diagnosed hypertension. Only 67 individuals (3.8%) had undiagnosed hypertension. Although 85.8% of hypertensive patients were treated, the median proportions of patients with blood pressure below goal (< 140/90, < 130/80 with diabetes) was 33.3% (21.8%-43.7%), with women more likely to be controlled and individuals treated by a solo provider less likely to be controlled.
AB  - LIMITATIONS: These data were abstracted from the charts of patients who received a lipid profile; therefore, they are only generalizable to individuals who are screened for hyperlipidemia.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There remains a need to improve hypertension management in North Carolina primary care among patients screened for hyperlipidemia.

TI  - Hypertension Improvement Project (HIP): study protocol and implementation challenges.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects 29% of the adult U.S. population and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Despite numerous effective treatments, only 53% of people with hypertension are at goal blood pressure. The chronic care model suggests that blood pressure control can be achieved by improving how patients and physicians address patient self-care.
AB  - METHODS AND DESIGN: This paper describes the protocol of a nested 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial to test the separate and combined effects on systolic blood pressure of a behavioral intervention for patients and a quality improvement-type intervention for physicians. Primary care practices were randomly assigned to the physician intervention or to the physician control condition. Physician randomization occurred at the clinic level. The physician intervention included training and performance monitoring. The training comprised 2 internet-based modules detailing both the JNC-7 hypertension guidelines and lifestyle modifications for hypertension. Performance data were collected for 18 months, and feedback was provided to physicians every 3 months. Patient participants in both intervention and control clinics were individually randomized to the patient intervention or to usual care. The patient intervention consisted of a 6-month behavioral intervention conducted by trained interventionists in 20 group sessions, followed by 12 monthly phone contacts by community health advisors. Follow-up measurements were performed at 6 and 18 months. The primary outcome was the mean change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were diastolic blood pressure and the proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control at 6 and 18 months.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Overall, 8 practices (4 per treatment group), 32 physicians (4 per practice; 16 per treatment group), and 574 patients (289 control and 285 intervention) were enrolled. Baseline characteristics of patients and providers and the challenges faced during study implementation are presented. The HIP interventions may improve blood pressure control and lower cardiovascular disease risk in a primary care practice setting by addressing key components of the chronic care model. The study design allows an assessment of the effectiveness and cost of physician and patient interventions separately, so that health care organizations can make informed decisions about implementation of 1 or both interventions in the context of local resources.

TI  - A multifaceted intervention to improve blood pressure control: The Guideline Adherence for Heart Health (GLAD) study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although high blood pressure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, the proportion reaching the goal blood pressures as outlined in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) is low. We conducted a randomized trial in primary care practices of a multifactorial intervention targeted to improve providers' adherence to hypertension guidelines.
AB  - METHOD: A total of 61 primary care practices in North Carolina were randomized to receive either a multifactorial intervention (guideline dissemination via a continuing medical education session, academic detailing sessions, audit and feedback on preintervention rates of adherence, and automated blood pressure machines) or an attention control of similar magnitude but targeted at a different guideline. Outcomes were determined through review of patient charts conducted by an independent masked quality assurance organization.
AB  - RESULTS: We found no difference between the 2 groups in any of the adherence measures including no difference in the percentage of patients at goal (intervention 49.2%, control 50.6%), with undiagnosed hypertension (18.1% vs 13.6%), average systolic (126 vs 125.1 mm Hg), or diastolic blood pressure (73.1 vs 73.4 mm Hg). Similarly, there was no difference in provider adherence to treatment recommendations (use of thiazide-type diuretic as first-line therapy: 32% vs 29.5%; use of 2-drug therapy in stage 2 hypertension: 11.3% vs 10.4%).
AB  - CONCLUSION: An intensive, multifactorial intervention did not improve adherence to national hypertension guidelines among community-based primary care. Efforts should be focused on other types of interventions to improve rates of control of hypertension.

TI  - Can individuals meet multiple physical activity and dietary behavior goals?.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether participants with the most behavioral goals to achieve were more likely to meet more goals than those given fewer goals.
AB  - METHODS: Eight hundred ten participants were randomly assigned to advice-only, established guidelines for blood pressure control (reduced sodium, increased physical activity), or established guidelines plus the DASH diet (increased fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, reduced fat).
AB  - RESULTS: At 6 months, 11.7% of Advice-Only, 19.3% of Established, and 44.6% of Established plus DASH met at least 3 goals (P<0.0001). At 18 months, 33.5% of Established plus DASH met at least 3 goals.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Those with the most goals to achieve reached the most goals.

TI  - Beta testing of a network-based health literacy program tailored for older adults with hypertension.
AB  - A touch screen-enabled "Personal Education Program" was modified to the "next generation" to capture self-medication behaviors of older adults with hypertension and assess related knowledge and self-efficacy. The program analyzes patient-entered information and delivers interactive educational content tailored to the reported behaviors. Summaries of self-reported symptoms, medication use (including frequency/time), drug interactions, and corrective strategies with an illustration of the drug interaction are printed to inform the provider before the primary care visit and for the patient to take home for self-study. After formative research during development and formal diagnostic and verification usability studies with advanced practice nurses and older adults, a beta test was conducted with older adults with hypertension over a 3-month period. Findings from the beta test suggest that older adult user satisfaction was high. Blood pressure declined over the four visits for 82% of the participants. The next generation of the Personal Education Program had a large effect size in increasing knowledge and self-efficacy for avoiding adverse self-medication behaviors. Behavior risk score did not change significantly but was significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure on the fourth visit. The positive results found in this small sample suggest that the next generation of the Personal Education Program could play a central role in facilitating patient-provider communication and medication adherence.

TI  - Provider communication effects medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of patients' perceptions of providers' communication on medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 439 patients with poorly controlled hypertension followed in community-based healthcare practices in the New York metropolitan area. Patients' rating of their providers' communication was assessed with a perceived communication style questionnaire,while medication adherence was assessed with the Morisky self-report measure.
AB  - RESULTS: Majority of participants were female, low-income, and had high school level educations, with mean age of 58 years. Fifty-five percent reported being nonadherent with their medications; and 51% rated their provider's communication to be non-collaborative. In multivariate analysis adjusted for patient demographics and covariates (depressive symptoms, provider degree), communication rated as collaborative was associated with better medication adherence (beta=-.11, p=.03). Other significant correlates of medication adherence independent of perceived communication were age (beta=.13, p=.02) and depressive symptoms (beta=-.18, p=.001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Provider communication rated as more collaborative was associated with better adherence to antihypertensive medications in a sample of low-income hypertensive African-American patients.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The quality of patient-provider communication is a potentially modifiable element of the medical relationship that may affect health outcomes in this high-risk patient population.

TI  - Revision and validation of the medication adherence self-efficacy scale (MASES) in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - Study purpose was to revise and examine the validity of the Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (MASES) in an independent sample of 168 hypertensive African Americans: mean age 54 years (SD = 12.36); 86% female; 76% high school education or greater. Participants provided demographic information; completed the MASES, self-report and electronic measures of medication adherence at baseline and three months. Confirmatory (CFA), exploratory (EFA) factor analyses, and classical test theory (CTT) analyses suggested that MASES is unidimensional and internally reliable. Item response theory (IRT) analyses led to a revised 13-item version of the scale: MASES-R. EFA, CTT, and IRT results provide a foundation of support for MASES-R reliability and validity for African Americans with hypertension. Research examining MASES-R psychometric properties in other ethnic groups will improve generalizability of findings and utility of the scale across groups. The MASES-R is brief, quick to administer, and can capture useful data on adherence self-efficacy.

TI  - A practice-based trial of motivational interviewing and adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor medication adherence is a significant problem in hypertensive African Americans. Although motivational interviewing (MINT) is effective for adoption and maintenance of health behaviors in patients with chronic diseases, its effect on medication adherence remains untested in this population.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial tested the effect of a practice-based MINT counseling vs. usual care (UC) on medication adherence and blood pressure (BP) in 190 hypertensive African Americans (88% women; mean age 54 years). Patients were recruited from two community-based primary care practices in New York City. The primary outcome was adherence measured by electronic pill monitors; the secondary outcome was within-patient change in office BP from baseline to 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Baseline adherence was similar in both groups (56.2 and 56.6% for MINT and UC, respectively, P = 0.94). Based on intent-to-treat analysis using mixed-effects regression, a significant time x group interaction with model-predicted posttreatment adherence rates of 43 and 57% were found in the UC and MINT groups, respectively (P = 0.027), with a between-group difference of 14% (95% confidence interval, -0.2 to -27%). The between-group difference in systolic and diastolic BP was -6.1 mm Hg (P = 0.065) and -1.4 mm Hg (P = 0.465), respectively, in favor of the MINT group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A practice-based MINT counseling led to steady maintenance of medication adherence over time, compared to significant decline in adherence for UC patients. This effect was associated with a modest, nonsignificant trend toward a net reduction in systolic BP in favor of the MINT group.

TI  - Adherence treatment factors in hypertensive African American women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension among African American women is of epidemic proportions. Nonadherence to treatment contributes to uncontrolled blood pressure in this population. Factors associated with adherence to treatment in African American women are unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with adherence to hypertension treatment in African American women.
AB  - METHODS: Five audio-taped focus groups were conducted with hypertensive African American women, 35 years and older receiving treatment for hypertension from an inner-city free clinic. All transcripts from the tapes were analyzed for content describing adherence to treatment factors.
AB  - FINDINGS: factors associated with adherence to treatment in hypertensive african american women were in three main categories including: beliefs about hypertension, facilitators of adherence to treatment, and barriers to adherence to treatment.
AB  - IMPLICATIONS: The study supports the need for education on managing hypertension and medication side effects, early screening for depression in hypertensive African Americans, development of culturally sensitive hypertension educational material, and formation of support groups for promoting adherence to treatment among African American women with hypertension.

TI  - Integration of depression and hypertension treatment: a pilot, randomized controlled trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: We wanted to examine whether integrating depression treatment into care for hypertension improved adherence to antidepressant and antihypertensive medications, depression outcomes, and blood pressure control among older primary care patients.
AB  - METHODS: Older adults prescribed pharmacotherapy for depression and hypertension from physicians at a large primary care practice in West Philadelphia were randomly assigned to an integrated care intervention or usual care. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to assess depression, an electronic monitor to measure blood pressure, and the Medication Event Monitoring System to assess adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: In all, 64 participants aged 50 to 80 years participated. Participants in the integrated care intervention had fewer depressive symptoms (CES-D mean scores, intervention 9.9 vs usual care 19.3; P <.01), lower systolic blood pressure (intervention 127.3 mm Hg vs usual care 141.3 mm Hg; P <.01), and lower diastolic blood pressure (intervention 75.8 mm Hg vs usual care 85.0 mm Hg; P <.01) compared with participants in the usual care group at 6 weeks. Compared with the usual care group, the proportion of participants in the intervention group who had 80% or greater adherence to an antidepressant medication (intervention 71.9% vs usual care 31.3%; P <.01) and to an antihypertensive medication (intervention 78.1% vs usual care 31.3%; P <.001) was greater at 6 weeks.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A pilot, randomized controlled trial integrating depression and hypertension treatment was successful in improving patient outcomes. Integrated interventions may be more feasible and effective in real-world practices, where there are competing demands for limited resources.

TI  - Physician adherence to blood pressure guidelines and its effect on seniors.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare physician adherence to guidelines from the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure for patients younger than 65 years of age with those aged 65 years and older, and to analyze whether factor groupings (subsets of criteria used to determine adherence) were predictive of blood pressure control.
AB  - DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review.
AB  - SETTING: Five university-affiliated family medicine and internal medicine outpatient clinics.
AB  - PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-nine patients (age range 21-85 yrs) with uncontrolled hypertension: 105 patients were younger than 65 years (nonsenior), and 74 patients were 65 years or older (senior).
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data abstracted from each patient's medical record were used to evaluate adherence to 17 process-of-care criteria, identified to assess physician adherence to the guidelines. A computer algorithm generated scores for each criterion as well as an overall adherence score. The relationship between the adherence score and blood pressure control was then examined. Separate factor analyses were conducted to ascertain differences in the way that the criteria were grouped. Factor scores were calculated for each patient, and the scores were evaluated in the context of blood pressure control. Guideline adherence scores were significantly higher for nonsenior patients than for senior patients (59.3% vs 56.1%, p=0.024). Blood pressure control rate was also higher, although not significantly, in nonseniors versus seniors (68.6% vs 56.8%, p=0.063). No factors in the senior group were significantly associated with blood pressure control, but one was significantly correlated in the nonsenior group (p<0.0001). It included diuretic therapy, adjusting a drug when a patient's blood pressure was uncontrolled, documentation of uncontrolled blood pressure in the medical record at the visit, documentation of the correct blood pressure goal, documentation of cardiovascular risk factors, and measurement of urine albumin level.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Overall physician adherence to blood pressure guidelines was significantly higher for the nonsenior group than for the senior group. Similarly, control of blood pressure was better in the nonsenior group. However, no significant relationship between overall adherence scores and blood pressure control was found in either group. In nonseniors, one factor grouping was significantly correlated with blood pressure control. Future studies should evaluate the process-of-care criteria to determine if and how they are related to blood pressure control in senior patients.

TI  - Predictive validity of a medication adherence measure in an outpatient setting.
AB  - This study examines the psychometric properties and tests the concurrent and predictive validity of a structured, self-reported medication adherence measure in patients with hypertension. The authors also assessed various psychosocial determinants of adherence, such as knowledge, social support, satisfaction with care, and complexity of the medical regimen. A total of 1367 patients participated in the study; mean age was 52.5 years, 40.8% were male, 76.5% were black, 50.8% graduated from high school, 26% were married, and 54.1% had income <$5,000. The 8-item medication adherence scale was reliable (alpha=.83) and significantly associated with blood pressure control (P<.05). Using a cutpoint of <6, the sensitivity of the measure to identify patients with poor blood pressure control was estimated to be 93%, and the specificity was 53%. The medication adherence measure proved to be reliable, with good concurrent and predictive validity in primarily low-income, minority patients with hypertension and might function as a screening tool in outpatient settings with other patient groups.

TI  - A cluster randomized trial to evaluate physician/pharmacist collaboration to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - This was a prospective, cluster randomized controlled trial in patients with uncontrolled hypertension aged 21 to 85 years (mean, 61 years). Pharmacists made recommendations to physicians for patients in the intervention clinics (n=101) but not patients in the control clinics (n=78). The mean adjusted difference in systolic blood pressure (BP) between the control and intervention groups was 8.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4-12.9), while the difference in diastolic BP was 5.4 mm Hg (CI, 2.8-8.0) at 9 months. The 24-hour BP levels showed similar effects, with a mean systolic BP level that was 8.8 mm Hg lower (CI, 5.0-12.6) and a mean diastolic BP level that was 4.6 mm Hg (CI, 2.4-6.8) lower in the intervention group. BP was controlled in 89.1% of patients in the intervention group and 52.9% in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 8.9; CI, 3.8-20.7; P<.001). Physician/pharmacist collaboration achieved significantly better mean BP values and overall BP control rates, primarily by intensification of medication therapy and improving patient adherence.

TI  - Improving hypertension control in diabetes mellitus: the effects of collaborative and proactive health communication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Communication between patients and clinicians using collaborative goals and treatment plans may overcome barriers to achieving hypertension control in routine diabetes mellitus care. We assessed the interrelation of patient-clinician communication factors to determine their independent associations with hypertension control in diabetes care.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 566 older adults with diabetes mellitus and hypertension at the DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston, Tex. Clinical and pharmacy data were collected, and a patient questionnaire was sent to all participants. A total of 212 individuals returned surveys. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the effect of patient characteristics, self-management behaviors, and communication factors on hypertension control. Three communication factors had significant associations with hypertension control. Two factors, patients' endorsement of a shared decision-making style (odds ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 2.57) and proactive communication with one's clinician about abnormal results of blood pressure self-monitoring (odds ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 3.26), had direct, independent associations in multivariate regression. Path analysis was used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of communication factors and hypertension control. Decision-making style (beta=0.20, P<0.01) and proactive communication (beta=0.50, P<0.0001) again demonstrated direct effects on hypertension control. A third factor, clinicians' use of collaborative communication when setting treatment goals, had a total effect on hypertension control of 0.16 (P<0.05) through its direct effects on decision-making style (beta=0.28, P<0.001) and proactive communication (beta=0.22, P<0.01).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Three communication factors were found to have significant associations with hypertension control. Patient-clinician communication that facilitates collaborative blood pressure goals and patients' input related to the progress of treatment may improve rates of hypertension control in diabetes care independent of medication adherence.

TI  - Take Control of Your Blood Pressure (TCYB) study: a multifactorial tailored behavioral and educational intervention for achieving blood pressure control.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluating a randomized controlled trial involving a tailored behavioral intervention conducted to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: Adults with hypertension from two outpatient primary care clinics were randomly allocated to receive a nurse-administered behavioral intervention or usual care. In this ongoing study, patients receive the tailored behavioral intervention bi-monthly for 2 years via telephone; the goal of the intervention is to promote medication adherence and improve hypertension-related health behaviors. Patient factors targeted in the tailored behavioral intervention include perceived risk of hypertension and knowledge, memory, medical and social support, patients' relationship with their health care provider, adverse effects of medication therapy, weight management, exercise, diet, stress, smoking, and alcohol use.
AB  - RESULTS: The sample randomized to the behavioral intervention consisted of 319 adults with hypertension (average age=60.5 years; 47% African-American). A comparable sample of adults was assigned to usual care (n=317). We had a 96% retention rate for the overall sample for the first 6 months of the study (93% at 12 months). The average phone call has lasted 18min (range 2-51min). From baseline to 6 months, self-reported medication adherence increased by 9% in the behavioral group vs. 1% in the non-behavioral group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention is easily implemented and is designed to enhance adherence with prescribed hypertension regimen. The study includes both general and patient-tailored information based upon need assessment. The study design ensures internal validity as well as the ability to generalize study findings to the clinic settings.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Despite knowledge of the risks and acceptable evidence, a large number of hypertensive adults still do not have their blood pressure under effective control. This study will be an important step in evaluating a tailored multibehavioral intervention focusing on improving blood pressure control.

TI  - Effect of general practitioner education on adherence to antihypertensive drugs: cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a simple educational package for general practitioners on adherence to antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Six randomly selected communities in Karachi, Pakistan.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 200 patients with hypertension taking antihypertensive drugs; 78 general practitioners.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Care by general practitioners specially trained in management of hypertension compared with usual care.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correct dosing, defined as percentage of prescribed doses taken, measured with electronic medication event monitoring system (MEMS) bottle.
AB  - RESULTS: 200 patients were enrolled, and 178 (89%) successfully completed six weeks of follow-up. Adherence was significantly greater in the special care group than in the usual care group (unadjusted mean percentage days with correct dose 48.1%, 95% confidence interval 35.8% to 60.4%, versus 32.4%, 22.6% to 42.3%; P=0.048). Adherence was also higher among patients who had higher levels of education (P<0.001), were encouraged by family members (P<0.001), believed in the effect of drugs (P<0.001), and had the purpose of the drugs explained to them (P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Special training of general practitioners in management of hypertension, emphasising good communication between doctors and patients, is more effective than usual care provided in the communities in Karachi. Such simple interventions should be adopted by other developing countries that are now facing an increasing burden of hypertension.

TI  - Electronic communications and home blood pressure monitoring (e-BP) study: design, delivery, and evaluation framework.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have provided unequivocal evidence that treatment of hypertension decreases mortality and major disability from cardiovascular disease; however, blood pressure remains inadequately treated in most affected individuals. This large gap continues despite the facts that more than 90% of adults with hypertension have health insurance, and hypertension is the leading cause of visits to the doctor. New approaches are needed to improve hypertension care.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Electronic Communications and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (e-BP) study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether care based on the Chronic Care Model and delivered over the Internet improves hypertension care. The primary study outcomes are systolic, diastolic, and blood pressure control; secondary outcomes are medication adherence, patient self-efficacy, satisfaction and quality of life, and healthcare utilization and costs.
AB  - METHODS: Hypertensive patients receiving care at Group Health medical centers are eligible if they have uncontrolled blood pressure on two screening visits and access to the Web and an e-mail address. Study participants are randomly assigned to three intervention groups: (a) usual care; (b) home blood pressure monitoring receipt and proficiency training on its use and the Group Health secure patient website (with secure e-mail access to their healthcare provider, access to a shared medical record, prescription refill and other services); or (c) this plus pharmacist care management (collaborative care management between the patient, the pharmacist, and the patient's physician via a secure patient website and the electronic medical record).
AB  - CONCLUSION: We will determine whether a new model of patient-centered care that leverages Web communications, self-monitoring, and collaborative care management improves hypertension control. If this model proves successful and cost-effective, similar interventions could be used to improve the care of large numbers of patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - Identifying barriers to hypertension guideline adherence using clinician feedback at the point of care.
AB  - Factors contributing to low adherence to clinical guidelines by clinicians are not well understood. The user interface of ATHENA-HTN, a guideline-based decision support system (DSS) for hypertension, presents a novel opportunity to collect clinician feedback on recommendations displayed at the point of care. We analyzed feedback from 46 clinicians who received ATHENA advisories as part of a 15-month randomized trial to identify potential reasons clinicians may not intensify hypertension therapy when it is recommended. Among the 368 visits for which feedback was provided, clinicians commonly reported they did not follow recommendations because: recorded blood pressure was not representative of the patient's typical blood pressure; hypertension was not a clinical priority for the visit; or patients were nonadherent to medications. For many visits, current quality-assurance algorithms may incorrectly identify clinically appropriate decisions as guideline nonadherent due to incomplete capture of relevant information. We present recommendations for how automated DSSs may help identify "apparent" barriers and better target decision support.

TI  - Efficacy of a transtheoretical model-based expert system for antihypertensive adherence.
AB  - Blood pressure is not controlled in as many as 50%-75% of hypertensive patients, primarily because of inadequate adherence to treatment. This paper examines the efficacy of a Transtheoretical Model (TTM)-based expert system intervention designed to improve adherence with antihypertensives in a sample of 1,227 adults. Participants were proactively recruited and randomly assigned to receive usual care or three individualized expert system reports and a stage-matched manual over 6 months. Participants were surveyed at baseline, and 6, 12, and 18 months. Significantly more of the intervention group participants reported being in Action and Maintenance at follow-up time points (ie, 73.1% of the treatment group versus 57.6% of the control group at 12 months and 69.1% of the treatment group versus 59.2% of the control group at 18 months). Scores on a behavioral measure of nonadherence differed significantly at follow-up time points. TTM-based expert system interventions have the potential for a significant impact on entire populations of individuals who fail to adhere, regardless of their readiness to change.

TI  - Therapy modifications in response to poorly controlled hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poorly controlled cardiovascular risk factors are common. Evaluating whether physicians respond appropriately to poor risk factor control in patients may better reflect quality of care than measuring proportions of patients whose conditions are controlled.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate therapy modifications in response to poor control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes in a large clinical population.
AB  - DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study within an 18-month period in 2002 to 2003.
AB  - SETTING: Kaiser Permanente of Northern California.
AB  - PATIENTS: 253,238 adult members with poor control of 1 or more of these conditions.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: The authors assessed the proportion of patients with poor control who experienced a change in pharmacotherapy within 6 months, and they defined "appropriate care" as a therapy modification or return to control without therapy modification within 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 64% of patients experienced modifications in therapy for poorly controlled systolic blood pressure, 71% for poorly controlled diastolic blood pressure, 56% for poorly controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and 66% for poorly controlled hemoglobin A1c level. Most frequent modifications were increases in number of drug classes (from 70% to 84%) and increased dosage (from 15% to 40%). An additional 7% to 11% of those with poorly controlled blood pressure, but only 3% to 4% of those with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level or hemoglobin A1c level, returned to control without therapy modification. Patients with more than 1 of the 3 conditions, higher baseline values, and target organ damage were more likely to receive "appropriate care."
AB  - LIMITATIONS: Patient preferences and suboptimal adherence to therapy were not measured and may explain some failures to act.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: As an additional measure of the quality of care, measuring therapy modifications in response to poor control in a large population is feasible. Many patients with poorly controlled hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes had their therapy modified and, thus, seemed to receive clinically "appropriate care" with this new quality measure.

TI  - The experimental evidence for weight-loss treatment of essential hypertension: a critical review. [Review] [116 refs]
AB  - The empirical evidence concerning the therapeutic effects of weight loss for hypertension treatment was reviewed. Interventions were critically reviewed for strength of measures and experimental design. Six of 21 intervention studies proved to be methodologically strong. However, only one study was considered a randomized clinical trial, testing the combined effects of weight reduction and pharmacological treatment of hypertension. Average blood pressure decrease obtained from the methodologically strongest studies was -21 mmHg and -13 mmHg, for systolic and diastolic measures, respectively. This magnitude change suggests that weight loss may be a clinically and statistically significant treatment. Confounding and bias variables, such as adherence to diet, medication, salt consumption, etc., were discussed and future areas of research were outlined. It was concluded that weight loss appears to be an effective and safe treatment of hypertension. [References: 116]

TI  - [Prevention of therapeutic inertia in the treatment of arterial hypertension by using a program of home blood pressure monitoring]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a program of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) on therapeutic Inertia (TI) in mild-to-moderate hypertension (AHT).
AB  - DESIGN: Controlled, randomised clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: Forty six clinics in 35 primary care centres. Spain.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 232 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were included.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Two groups with 116 patients were formed: 1) Control group (CG): standard health intervention; 2) Intervention group (IG): patients who were included in the HBPM program.
AB  - MAIN MEASUREMENTS: TI was calculated by the ratio: Number of patients whose pharmacological treatment was not changed in each visit/Number of patients with an average BP 140mmHg and/or 90mmHg in the general population or 130 and/or 90 mmHg in diabetics. The mean BPs and the percentage of controlled patients were calculated. The mean number of people that required an intervention in order to avoid TI was calculated (NI).
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 209 patients completed the study, with TI in 35.64% (95% CI=29.85%-41.43%) of the sample, and in 71.63% (95% CI=63.9-79.36%) of the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The TI was 22.42% (95% CI=24.2-37%) in the IG and 50% (95% CI=37.75-62.25) in the CG (p<.05) in visit 2, and 25.23% (95% CI=14.84-35.62) and 46.07% (95% CI=33.85-58.29) in the final visit for IG and CG, respectively (P<.05). The NI was 4.3.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TI was very significant among the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The studied interventions are effective for improving TI.Copyright A© 2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

TI  - [Non-pharmacological intervention as a strategy to improve antihypertensive treatment compliance]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of an intervention by means of an educational magazine on treatment compliance in uncontrolled arterial hypertension (AHT).
AB  - DESIGN: Controlled, randomised clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: 87 primary care centres. Spain.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 450 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were included.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Two groups of 225 patients were formed: 1) Control group (CG): standard health intervention; 2) Intervention Group (IG): received a twice monthly educational magazine at home.
AB  - MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Compliance was measured using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS-Aardex). Compliance rate (CR) was recorded. Compliers were defined as individuals with a treatment compliance of 80-110%. The percentage of compliers, the mean percentage of doses taken and the percentage of patients taking the medication at the correct times were estimated. The mean blood pressures (BPs) and the percentage of controlled patientswere calculated. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 393 individuals were evaluable (Age: 62.4 years), 196 in the IG and 197 in the CG. There were 83.2% (95% CI 78-88.4) and 49.2% (95% CI 42.2-56.2) (P=0.0001) of overall compliers in the IG and CG, respectively and 74% (95% CI: 67.9-80.1) and 42.6% (95% CI=35.7-49.5) (P=0.0001) of correct times compliers. A total of 81.6% (95% CI=76.2-86.5%)) were controlled in the IG and 56.3% (95% CI=49.4-63.2) in the CG. The NNT was 3.3 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic non-compliance was very high. The educational magazine is an effective strategy to improve the compliance and degree of control of the AHT.

AB  - RESULTS: A total of 921 patients completed the study, and 1842 visits were made, with TI in 36.8% (IC=5.8%) of the sample and in 82.58% (IC=8.2%) of the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The TI was 60% (CI=4.2%), 38.4% (CI=4.4%) 30.2 (CI=4.3%) and 14.7 (CI=3.3%) (p=0.001) for CG, EG, CHG and ECHG, respectively. The percentage controlled at the end of study was 35.3% (CI=1.1%), 54.7% (CI=1.8%), 60.2% (CI=2.1%) and 65.1% (CI=2.2%) (p<0.01) for CG, EG, CHG and ECHG, respectively. The NI were 4.6, 3.3 and 2.2 for CG, EG, CHG and ECHG, respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TI was very significant among the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The studied interventions are effective for improving TI.

TI  - [Current situation of hypertensive patients over 75 years old: the DISEHTAE study]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess in patients over 75 years old the degree of their compliance with recommendations on follow-up, control and treatment of hypertension.
AB  - DESIGN: Descriptive, multi-centre study, covering the whole of Spain.
AB  - SETTING: A total of 107 health centres from 14 autonomous communities.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Hypertensive patients over 75: 1,369 clinical charts. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN MEASUREMENTS: The variables studied were: age and sex, place monitored, blood pressure figures, screening for, and diagnosis of diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, smoking, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and obesity. Blood creatinine, proteinuria, prescribed medication, and infrastructure variables were also included.
AB  - RESULTS: The most often screened cardiovascular risk factor (CRF) was obesity (76.1%), whilst the most prevalent was hypercholesterolaemia (31.3%). Of the patients, 25.5% had associated diabetes and 48.5% had a body mass index (BMI) >25. Low microalbuminuria (8.4%) was found. The proportion of patients with their blood pressure controlled was higher among those monitored in primary care (32.8%) than out of primary care (23.2%). No drug treatment was prescribed for 7.9%, only hygiene-dietary measures. The most common pharmacological group was that of the diuretics, followed by IECAS and ARA II.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Though we can say that the degree of control of hypertension in elderly patients is steadily increasing, it is still far from optimal in most of our patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: First, to assess whether it is useful for a patient to take part in the analysis of the causes of non-compliance with therapy for hypertension. Second, to design a questionnaire to evaluate the causes and the degree of adherence to therapy and to construct indicators on the basis of this. Lastly, to determine the effectiveness of the feedback of the evaluation of these indicators to health professionals, as a method of improving hypertense patients' adherence to therapy.
AB  - DESIGN: Qualitative study through the focus group technique; b) quasi-experimental design of independent samples between evaluation and re-evaluation with two study groups: experimental (3 PC health centres) and control (3 PC health centres).
AB  - SETTING: PC health centres.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Patients over 18 on medical hypertension treatment.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: First phase: analysis of the reasons for non-compliance with therapy through the group focus technique and design of the questionnaire to evaluate factors associated with non-compliance. Second phase: evaluation and pilot study of the questionnaire. For this, a questionnaire to assess therapy adherence and to determine the weight of related factors will be sent to a random sample of hypertense patients at each Health Centre. Third phase: intervention. A report with the results of the first assessment will be sent to the health professionals of the experimental group. Fourth phase: re-evaluation of the indicators of adherence, and analysis of the improvement achieved.

TI  - Effect of a pharmacy care program on medication adherence and persistence, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: Poor medication adherence diminishes the health benefits of pharmacotherapies. Elderly patients with coronary risk factors frequently require treatment with multiple medications, placing them at increased risk for nonadherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a comprehensive pharmacy care program to improve medication adherence and its associated effects on blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A multiphase, prospective study with an observational phase and a randomized controlled trial conducted at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center of 200 community-based patients aged 65 years or older taking at least 4 chronic medications. The study was conducted from June 2004 to August 2006.
AB  - INTERVENTION: After a 2-month run-in phase (measurement of baseline adherence, BP, and LDL-C), patients entered a 6-month intervention phase (standardized medication education, regular follow-up by pharmacists, and medications dispensed in time-specific packs). Following the intervention phase, patients were randomized to continued pharmacy care vs usual care for an additional 6 months.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point of the observation phase was change in the proportion of pills taken vs baseline; secondary end points were the associated changes in BP and LDL-C. Primary end point of the randomization phase was the between-group comparison of medication persistence.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 200 elderly patients (77.1% men; mean [SD] age, 78 [8.3] years), taking a mean (SD) of 9 (3) chronic medications were enrolled. Coronary risk factors included drug-treated hypertension in 184 patients (91.5%) and drug-treated hyperlipidemia in 162 (80.6%). Mean (SD) baseline medication adherence was 61.2% (13.5%). After 6 months of intervention, medication adherence increased to 96.9% (5.2%; P<.001) and was associated with significant improvements in systolic BP (133.2 [14.9] to 129.9 [16.0] mm Hg; P = .02) and LDL-C (91.7 [26.1] to 86.8 [23.4] mg/dL; P = .001). Six months after randomization, the persistence of medication adherence decreased to 69.1% (16.4%) among those patients assigned to usual care, whereas it was sustained at 95.5% (7.7%) in pharmacy care (P<.001). This was associated with significant reductions in systolic BP in the pharmacy care group (-6.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -10.7 to -3.1 mm Hg) vs the usual care group (-1.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.9 to 3.9 mm Hg; P = .04), but no significant between-group differences in LDL-C levels or reductions.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacy care program led to increases in medication adherence, medication persistence, and clinically meaningful reductions in BP, whereas discontinuation of the program was associated with decreased medication adherence and persistence.

TI  - Comparison of the Atkins, Ornish, Weight Watchers, and Zone diets for weight loss and heart disease risk reduction: a randomized trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: The scarcity of data addressing the health effects of popular diets is an important public health concern, especially since patients and physicians are interested in using popular diets as individualized eating strategies for disease prevention.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess adherence rates and the effectiveness of 4 popular diets (Atkins, Zone, Weight Watchers, and Ornish) for weight loss and cardiac risk factor reduction.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-center randomized trial at an academic medical center in Boston, Mass, of overweight or obese (body mass index: mean, 35; range, 27-42) adults aged 22 to 72 years with known hypertension, dyslipidemia, or fasting hyperglycemia. Participants were enrolled starting July 18, 2000, and randomized to 4 popular diet groups until January 24, 2002.
AB  - INTERVENTION: A total of 160 participants were randomly assigned to either Atkins (carbohydrate restriction, n=40), Zone (macronutrient balance, n=40), Weight Watchers (calorie restriction, n=40), or Ornish (fat restriction, n=40) diet groups. After 2 months of maximum effort, participants selected their own levels of dietary adherence.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One-year changes in baseline weight and cardiac risk factors, and self-selected dietary adherence rates per self-report.
AB  - RESULTS: Assuming no change from baseline for participants who discontinued the study, mean (SD) weight loss at 1 year was 2.1 (4.8) kg for Atkins (21 [53%] of 40 participants completed, P = .009), 3.2 (6.0) kg for Zone (26 [65%] of 40 completed, P = .002), 3.0 (4.9) kg for Weight Watchers (26 [65%] of 40 completed, P < .001), and 3.3 (7.3) kg for Ornish (20 [50%] of 40 completed, P = .007). Greater effects were observed in study completers. Each diet significantly reduced the low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio by approximately 10% (all P<.05), with no significant effects on blood pressure or glucose at 1 year. Amount of weight loss was associated with self-reported dietary adherence level (r = 0.60; P<.001) but not with diet type (r = 0.07; P = .40). For each diet, decreasing levels of total/HDL cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and insulin were significantly associated with weight loss (mean r = 0.36, 0.37, and 0.39, respectively) with no significant difference between diets (P = .48, P = .57, P = .31, respectively).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Each popular diet modestly reduced body weight and several cardiac risk factors at 1 year. Overall dietary adherence rates were low, although increased adherence was associated with greater weight loss and cardiac risk factor reductions for each diet group.

TI  - Effect of estrogen plus progestin on stroke in postmenopausal women: the Women's Health Initiative: a randomized trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial of estrogen plus progestin was stopped early because of adverse effects, including an increased risk of stroke in the estrogen plus progestin group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of estrogen plus progestin on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and in subgroups, and to determine whether the effect of estrogen plus progestin was modified by baseline levels of blood biomarkers.
AB  - DESIGN: Multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial involving 16 608 women aged 50 through 79 years with an average follow-up of 5.6 years. Baseline levels of blood-based markers of inflammation, thrombosis, and lipid levels were measured in the first 140 centrally confirmed stroke cases and 513 controls.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Participants received 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall strokes and stroke subtype and severity were centrally adjudicated by stroke neurologists.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one patients (1.8%) in the estrogen plus progestin and 107 (1.3%) in the placebo groups had strokes. Overall 79.8% of strokes were ischemic. For combined ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, the intention-to-treat hazard ratio (HR) for estrogen plus progestin vs placebo was 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.68); with adjustment for adherence, the HR was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.08-2.08). The HR for ischemic stroke was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.09-1.90) and for hemorrhagic stroke, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.43-1.56). Point estimates of the HRs indicate that excess risk of all stroke was apparent in all age groups, in all categories of baseline stroke risk, and in women with and without hypertension, prior history of cardiovascular disease, use of hormones, statins, or aspirin. Other risk factors for stroke, including smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, lower use of vitamin C supplements, blood-based biomarkers of inflammation, higher white blood cell count, and higher hematocrit levels did not modify the effect of estrogen plus progestin on stroke risk.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen plus progestin increases the risk of ischemic stroke in generally healthy postmenopausal women. Excess risk for all strokes attributed to estrogen plus progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women examined.

TI  - Adherence to National Cholesterol Education Program Treatment goals in postmenopausal women with heart disease. The Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS). The HERS Research Group.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of volunteer women with established heart disease who have low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels at or below the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel goals and to determine what factors are associated with levels above goal or not receiving lipid-lowering medication when indicated.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional measurement of lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure, height, weight, and other demographic and cardiovascular risk factors in 2763 postmenopausal women with heart disease.
AB  - SETTING: At 18 centers throughout the United States, participants were recruited by means of lists of women with coronary heart disease from coronary units and catheterization laboratories, direct mail to age-eligible women, and advertisements.
AB  - PATIENTS: Mean age of the cohort was 66.7 years (range, 44-79 years) and the distribution by race/ethnicity was 88.7% white, 7.9% African American, 2.0% Hispanic/Latina, 0.8% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 0.7% other.
AB  - INTERVENTION: We report cross-sectional analysis of the cohort at baseline.
AB  - OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured the frequency of achieving 1988 and 1993 Adult Treatment Panel treatment goals, and of being on a regimen of lipid-lowering medication.
AB  - RESULTS: Although 47% of participants were taking a lipid-lowering medication, 63% did not meet the 1988 treatment goal of LDL-C level less than 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) and 91% did not meet the 1993 goal of LDL-C level less than 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). Factors independently associated with achieving the earlier goal were use of lipid-lowering medication, marital status, education, body mass index, exercise, hypertension, diabetes, gallbladder disease, and first diagnosis of coronary heart disease after 1990. Failure to use lipid-lowering medication was associated with age, being African American, marital status, body mass index, lack of exercise, alcohol consumption, current smoking, and first diagnosis of coronary heart disease before 1985.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The majority of women enrolled in the trial had LDL-C levels that significantly exceeded the treatment goals set by the 1988 and 1993 Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. Better implementation of these guidelines among women with coronary disease would be highly desirable.

TI  - Dietary sodium restriction as adjunctive treatment of hypertension.
AB  - To examine the effect of modest dietary sodium ion restriction in treated hypertensive individuals, we studied 114 hypertensive patients undergoing individualized dietary counseling with a research dietitian to achieve reduction in dietary sodium ion intake. A significant reduction in mean sodium ion intake was achieved after the first of three lessons and was maintained for 30 weeks with no change in potassium ion intake. Significant falls in blood pressure and body weight were observed with no significant correlations noted between the two variables, implying independence of these effects. Individuals compliant with the dietary sodium ion restriction goal (urinary excretion, less than or equal to 80 mmol/d [less than or equal to 80 mEq/24 h]) were more likely to have a reduction in number of medications than those not reaching that goal. Ninety-eight of the 114 patients completed the entire 30 weeks. Patients who dropped out tended to have lower diastolic blood pressures and required fewer medications for blood pressure control than those who completed the 30 weeks. For these reasons, patients in the former group may have been less highly motivated to complete the study. These observations suggest that modest dietary sodium ion restriction is feasible in treated hypertensive patients and that adherence to such a regimen may permit blood pressure control with fewer medications.

TI  - Patient participation in a hypertension control program. Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program Cooperative Group.
AB  - In the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, the largest standardized hypertension detection, follow-up, and treatment program to date in the United States, participation rates have been high at all stages. More than 75% of those with suspected hypertension at screening attended follow-up rescreening, and more than 80% of the 5,314 hypertensive patients assigned to program treatment remained active at the end of one year. Differences in participation rates were generally small. To accomplish this, intensive efforts were required to maximize attendance, and the program was shaped to reduce known barriers to initial attendance and long-term adherence. Against the background of a high overall program response rate for all sex-race groups, factors that might be associated with variations in response were examined: age, socioeconomic characteristics, health status, and appointment schedule.

TI  - Patient behavior for blood pressure control. Guidelines for professionals.
AB  - Behaviors critical to hypertensive patients' achieving therapeutic control and assuming active responsibility for their own care were defined by an interdisciplinary group brought together by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. The report focused on the achievement and maintenance of long-term control through drug therapy and concentrated on the patient-physician interaction as a critical factor. The basic hypothesis that active participation by the patient favors successful management of hypertension identifies the physician, the prime diagnostician and initiator of the subsequent interaction, as a promotor of that important collaboration. The working group views the patient as the decision-maker and problemsolver, with the professional functioning as advisor and guide. This synthesis of available theory and practice in therapy adherence includes knowledge, attitudes, and skills defined under four major behaviors: making the decision for control, taking medication, monitoring progress, and problem solving.

TI  - Extended-release intramuscular naltrexone (VIVITROL): a review of its use in the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence in detoxified patients. [Review]
AB  - Naltrexone is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist that blocks the euphoric effects of heroin and prescription opioids. In order to improve treatment adherence, a once-monthly, intramuscular, extended-release formulation of naltrexone (XR-NTX) [VIVITROL()] has been developed, and approved in the USA and Russia for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, after opioid detoxification. The clinical efficacy of this formulation in patients with opioid dependence was demonstrated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase III trial (ALK21-013; n = 250). In this trial, opioid-detoxified patients receiving XR-NTX 380 mg once every 4 weeks, in combination with psychosocial support, had a significantly higher median proportion of weeks of confirmed opioid abstinence during weeks 5-24, compared with those receiving placebo (primary endpoint). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving XR-NTX achieved total confirmed abstinence during this period than those receiving placebo. XR-NTX was also associated with a significantly greater reduction in opioid craving and a significantly longer treatment retention period than placebo. XR-NTX was generally well tolerated in the phase III trial. The most common (incidence >5 %) treatment-emergent adverse events that also occurred more frequently with XR-NTX than with placebo were hepatic enzyme abnormalities, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, hypertension, influenza and injection-site pain. Thus, XR-NTX is a useful treatment option for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification.

TI  - Amlodipine/Atorvastatin: a review of its use in the treatment of hypertension and dyslipidaemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. [Review] [92 refs]
AB  - Amlodipine/atorvastatin (Caduet) is a single-tablet, fixed-dose combination of the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist amlodipine and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin. The bioavailability of amlodipine and atorvastatin with a single-tablet, fixed-dose amlodipine/atorvastatin combination was not significantly different to that with coadministered separate amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets. In well controlled clinical trials in patients with hypertension and dyslipidaemia, once-daily amlodipine and atorvastatin (administered as the single-tablet, fixed-dose combination or coadministered as two separate tablets) effectively reduced systolic BP (SBP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and enabled more patients to achieve BP and LDL-C goals than single-agent or placebo therapy. There was no modification of the effect of amlodipine on SBP when administered in combination with atorvastatin and there was no modification of the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-C when administered in combination with amlodipine. In noncomparative, titration-to-goal, open-label 'real-world' trials, the single-tablet, fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/atorvastatin enabled patients with hypertension and dyslipidaemia to achieve both BP and LDL-C goals. Administration of a single tablet of amlodipine/atorvastatin, compared with coadministration of these agents as two separate tablets, improved patient adherence, according to a retrospective study that utilized prescription refill rates from a large US insurance database. Data from the large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ASCOT-LLA trial also demonstrated that the combination of amlodipine-based therapy and atorvastatin was effective in preventing cardiovascular (CV) endpoints in hypertensive patients at risk of CV disease (CVD). In summary, amlodipine/atorvastatin offers a convenient and effective approach to improving adherence and managing CV risk in hypertensive patients with dyslipidaemia or at risk of CVD.

TI  - Understanding Perceptions and Practices for Zambian Adults in Western Province at Risk for Hypertension: An Exploratory Descriptive Study.
AB  - Hypertension is an important public health issue in Zambia. Despite the need for early detection, treatment, and ongoing monitoring, there is little documented research on hypertension in Zambia. The study aims were to: 1) better understand risk factors for hypertension in urban and rural communities in Mongu and Limulunga Districts, Western Province; 2) identify current health practices for hypertension and prevention in these communities; and 3) explore intersections between culture and hypertension perceptions and practices for study participants. A mixed methods approach was used; 203 adults completed surveys including demographics, anthropometric measures, blood pressure (BP), physicial activity, diet, and salt intake at five health check stations. Two focus groups were conducted with rural and urban community members to better understand their perspectives on hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension was 32.8% for survey participants. A further 24.6% had pre-hypertension. The mean total weight of salt added to food was nearly double the WHO recommendation with women adding significantly more salt to food than men. Significant differences in waist circumference were observed between men and women with men at low risk and women at substantialy high risk. In focus groups, participants cited westernized diets, lack of physical activity, stress, psychological factors, and urbanization as causative factors for hypertension. Participants lacked understanding of BP medications, healthy lifestyles, adherence to treatment, and ongoing monitoring. Focus group participants mentioned challenges in obtaining treatment for hypertension and desired to be active contributors in creating solutions. They recommended that government priorize hypertension initiatives that increase access to health education to reduce risk, enhance early detection, and support lifestyle changes and medication adherence. Our findings suggest that policy-makers need to engage communities more effectively to develop successful public health strategies to prevent, detect, and manage hypertension in Western Province, Zambia, particularly in rural areas.

TI  - Pilot Study to Test the Effectiveness of Different Financial Incentives to Improve Medication Adherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence affects health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Concepts from behavioral economics can guide the development of interventions to improve medication adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the relative effectiveness of 2 behavioral economic-based incentive structures to improve medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial compared adherence among participants taking antihypertensive or antihyperlipidemic medications randomized to usual care (UC), guaranteed pay-out (GPO) incentives, or lottery incentives. Daily adherence was measured over a 90-day period using electronic caps (Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS]). The GPO group received $30 up-front in a virtual account, with $0.50 deducted for each missed dose. Lottery group participants were eligible for a weekly $50 drawing, but only if they had taken their medication as prescribed all week. An electronic survey assessed self-reported adherence. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, paired t tests, ANOVA, and Pearson's correlations.
AB  - RESULTS: In all, 36 participants were randomized (UC, n = 11; GPO, n = 14; lottery, n = 11). Mean percentage (+/-SD) of days adherent during the incentive period was highest in the lottery group (96% +/- 5%), followed by the GPO group (94% +/- 9%) and the UC group (94% +/- 9%). There were no statistically significant differences among groups (P > 0.05). MEMS-measured adherence was not significantly correlated with a patient's self-reported adherence (P > 0.05) at baseline but was correlated at 90-day follow-up (P < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistically significant differences in adherence were demonstrated in this small sample of highly adherent participants, larger studies in a more diverse population or with other medications might show otherwise.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

TI  - Stop Hypertension with the Acupuncture Research Program (SHARP): results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  - Case studies and small trials suggest that acupuncture may effectively treat hypertension, but no large randomized trials have been reported. The Stop Hypertension with the Acupuncture Research Program pilot trial enrolled 192 participants with untreated blood pressure (BP) in the range of 140/90 to 179/109 mm Hg. The design of the trial combined rigorous methodology and adherence to principles of traditional Chinese medicine. Participants were weaned off antihypertensives before enrollment and were then randomly assigned to 3 treatments: individualized traditional Chinese acupuncture, standardized acupuncture at preselected points, or invasive sham acupuncture. Participants received < or = 12 acupuncture treatments over 6 to 8 weeks. During the first 10 weeks after random assignment, BP was monitored every 14 days, and antihypertensives were prescribed if BP exceeded 180/110 mm Hg. The mean BP decrease from baseline to 10 weeks, the primary end point, did not differ significantly between participants randomly assigned to active (individualized and standardized) versus sham acupuncture (systolic BP: -3.56 versus -3.84 mm Hg, respectively; 95% CI for the difference: -4.0 to 4.6 mm Hg; P=0.90; diastolic BP: -4.32 versus -2.81 mm Hg, 95% CI for the difference: -3.6 to 0.6 mm Hg; P=0.16). Categorizing participants by age, race, gender, baseline BP, history of antihypertensive use, obesity, or primary traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis did not reveal any subgroups for which the benefits of active acupuncture differed significantly from sham acupuncture. Active acupuncture provided no greater benefit than invasive sham acupuncture in reducing systolic or diastolic BP.

TI  - Long-Term Change in Diet Quality Is Associated with Body Weight Change in Men and Women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little evidence exists on change in diet quality and weight change.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between change of diet quality indexes and concurrent weight change over 20 y.
AB  - METHODS: In this analysis we followed 50,603 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), 22,973 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) between 1986 and 2006, and 72,495 younger women from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) between 1989 and 2007. Diet was measured every 4 y. We computed the Alternate Mediterranean Diet, the Alternate Health Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension adherence scores for each participant. All scores emphasize fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and nuts, but they differ in score range and components such as dairy, sodium, and sweetened beverages. Regression models were used to examine 4-y changes in these scores and weight change within the same period, adjusting for lifestyle factors.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean age at baseline was 49.4 y for NHS, 48.0 y for HPFS, and 36.3 y for NHS II. Baseline BMI (in kg/m(2)) was similar (23.7 for NHS, 24.7 for HPFS, and 23.0 for NHS II). We observed significantly less weight gain over 4-y periods with each SD increase of each diet quality score in both men and women. Results were significantly stronger in the younger cohort (NHS II) than in the older cohorts (e.g., -0.67 kg less weight gain in NHS II vs. -0.39 kg in NHS for each SD increase in AHEI-2010; P-heterogeneity: <0.001). Improvement of any of the diet scores benefited overweight (-0.27 to -1.08 kg less weight gain for each SD increase in score) more than normal-weight individuals (-0.10 to -0.40 kg; P-interaction: <0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Improvement of diet quality is associated with less weight gain, especially in younger women or overweight individuals.Copyright © 2015 American Society for Nutrition.

TI  - Medication Adherence and the Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality and Hospitalization Among Patients With Newly Prescribed Antihypertensive Medications.
AB  - The importance of adherence to antihypertensive treatments for the prevention of cardiovascular disease has not been well elucidated. This study evaluated the effect of antihypertensive medication adherence on specific cardiovascular disease mortality (ischemic heart disease [IHD], cerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral infarction). Our study used data from a 3% sample cohort that was randomly extracted from enrollees of Korean National Health Insurance. Study subjects were aged >20 years, were diagnosed with hypertension, and started newly prescribed antihypertensive medication in 2003 to 2004. Adherence to antihypertensive medication was estimated as the cumulative medication adherence. Subjects were divided into good (cumulative medication adherence, >80%), intermediate (cumulative medication adherence, 50%-80%), and poor (cumulative medication adherence, <50%) adherence groups. We used time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between medication adherence and health outcomes. Among 33728 eligible subjects, 670 (1.99%) died of coronary heart disease or stroke during follow-up. Patients with poor medication adherence had worse mortality from IHD (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.31; P for trend=0.005), cerebral hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-3.77; P for trend=0.004), and cerebral infarction (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.96; P for trend=0.003) than those with good adherence. The estimated hazard ratios of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease were consistent with the mortality end point. Poor medication adherence was associated with higher mortality and a greater risk of hospitalization for specific cardiovascular diseases, emphasizing the importance of a monitoring system and strategies to improve medication adherence in clinical practice.

TI  - Adherence with antihypertensive drug therapy and the risk of heart failure in clinical practice.
AB  - Randomized clinical trials have shown that antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of heart failure (HF). Limited evidence exists, however, on whether and to what extent this benefit is translated into real-life practice. A nested case-control study was carried out by including the cohort of 76 017 patients from Lombardy (Italy), aged 40 to 80 years, who were newly treated with antihypertensive drugs during 2005. Cases were the 622 patients who experienced hospitalization for HF from initial prescription until 2012. Up to 5 controls were randomly selected for each case. Logistic regression was used to model the HF risk associated with adherence to antihypertensive drugs, which was measured by the proportion of days covered by treatment (PDC). Data were adjusted for several covariates. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for possible sources of systematic uncertainty. Compared with patients with very low adherence (PDC, <25%), low, intermediate, and high adherences were associated with progressively lower risk of HF, reduction in the high-adherence group (>75%) being 34% (95% confidence interval, 17%-48%). Similar effects were observed in younger (40-70 years) and older (71-80 years) patients and between patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. There was no evidence that adherence with calcium-channel blockers reduced the HF risk. Antihypertensive treatment lowers the HF risk in real-life practice, but adherence to treatment is necessary for a substantial benefit to take place. This is the case with a variety of antihypertensive drugs. Copyright © 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.

TI  - Randomized comparison of renal denervation versus intensified pharmacotherapy including spironolactone in true-resistant hypertension: six-month results from the Prague-15 study.
AB  - This prospective, randomized, open-label multicenter trial evaluated the efficacy of catheter-based renal denervation (Symplicity, Medtronic) versus intensified pharmacological treatment including spironolactone (if tolerated) in patients with true-resistant hypertension. This was confirmed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after excluding secondary hypertension and confirmation of adherence to therapy by measurement of plasma antihypertensive drug levels before enrollment. One-hundred six patients were randomized to renal denervation (n=52), or intensified pharmacological treatment (n=54) with baseline systolic blood pressure of 159+/-17 and 155+/-17 mm Hg and average number of drugs 5.1 and 5.4, respectively. A significant reduction in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure after 6 months (-8.6 [95% cofidence interval: -11.8, -5.3] mm Hg; P<0.001 in renal denervation versus -8.1 [95% cofidence interval: -12.7, -3.4] mm Hg; P=0.001 in pharmacological group) was observed, which was comparable in both groups. Similarly, a significant reduction in systolic office blood pressure (-12.4 [95% cofidence interval: -17.0, -7.8] mm Hg; P<0.001 in renal denervation versus -14.3 [95% cofidence interval: -19.7, -8.9] mm Hg; P<0.001 in pharmacological group) was present. Between-group differences in change were not significant. The average number of antihypertensive drugs used after 6 months was significantly higher in the pharmacological group (+0.3 drugs; P<0.001). A significant increase in serum creatinine and a parallel decrease of creatinine clearance were observed in the pharmacological group; between-group difference were borderline significant. The 6-month results of this study confirmed the safety of renal denervation. In conclusion, renal denervation achieved reduction of blood pressure comparable with intensified pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Effectiveness of a tailored behavioral intervention to improve hypertension control: primary outcomes of a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - UNLABELLED: Blood pressure (BP) control rates are suboptimal. We evaluated the effectiveness of 2 behavioral interventions to improve BP control via a 3-arm, randomized controlled trial of 533 adults with repeated uncontrolled BP, despite antihypertensive drug treatment for >6 months. The interventions were a tailored stage-matched intervention (SMI) or a nontailored health education intervention (HEI) of 6 monthly calls targeting diet, exercise, and medication. Control was usual care (UC). There were no baseline group differences. Baseline BP control was 42.6%, 40.6%, and 44.6% in SMI, HEI, and UC (P=0.74), respectively; systolic BP (with SEs) was 136 (0.89), 137 (1.33), and 137 (0.96) mm Hg. Six-month control was 64.6% (SMI), 54.3% (HEI), and 45.8% (UC) (P values for pairwise comparisons versus UC, 0.001 [SMI] and 0.108 [HEI]). At 6 months, systolic BP (SE) was 131.2 (1.05), 131.8 (0.99), and 134.7 (1.02) for SMI, HEI, and UC, respectively (P values for pairwise comparisons versus UC, 0.009 for SMI and 0.047 for HEI). SMI led to lower systolic BP and better BP control than UC. SMI constitutes a new, potent approach to assist patients with uncontrolled hypertension to reach BP goals.

TI  - Adjusted drug treatment is superior to renal sympathetic denervation in patients with true treatment-resistant hypertension.
AB  - We aimed to investigate for the first time the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) versus clinically adjusted drug treatment in true treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH) after excluding patients with confounding poor drug adherence. Patients with apparent TRH (n=65) were referred for RDN, and those with secondary and spurious hypertension (n=26) were excluded. TRH was defined as office systolic BP (SBP) >140 mm Hg, despite maximally tolerated doses of >3 antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic. In addition, ambulatory daytime SBP >135 mm Hg after witnessed intake of antihypertensive drugs was required, after which 20 patients had normalized BP and were excluded. Patients with true TRH were randomized and underwent RDN (n=9) performed with Symplicity Catheter System versus clinically adjusted drug treatment (n=10). The study was stopped early for ethical reasons because RDN had uncertain BP-lowering effect. Office SBP and diastolic BP in the drug-adjusted group changed from 160+/-14/88+/-13 mm Hg (+/-SD) at baseline to 132+/-10/77+/-8 mm Hg at 6 months (P<0.0005 and P=0.02, SBP and diastolic BP, respectively) and in the RDN group from 156+/-13/91+/-15 to 148+/-7/89+/-8 mm Hg (P=0.42 and P=0.48, SBP and diastolic BP, respectively). SBP and diastolic BP were significantly lower in the drug-adjusted group at 6 months (P=0.002 and P=0.004, respectively), and absolute changes in SBP were larger in the drug-adjusted group (P=0.008). Ambulatory BPs changed in parallel to office BPs. Our data suggest that adjusted drug treatment has superior BP lowering effects compared with RDN in patients with true TRH.

TI  - Renal sympathetic denervation in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension after witnessed intake of medication before qualifying ambulatory blood pressure.
AB  - It is unknown whether the decline in blood pressure (BP) after renal denervation (RDN) is caused by denervation itself or concomitantly improved drug adherence. We aimed to investigate the BP lowering effect of RDN in true treatment-resistant hypertension by excluding patients with poor drug adherence. Patients with resistant hypertension (n=18) were referred for a thorough clinical and laboratory work-up. Treatment-resistant hypertension was defined as office systolic BP>140 mm Hg, despite maximally tolerated doses of > 3 antihypertensive drugs, including a diuretic. In addition, ambulatory daytime systolic BP>135 mm Hg was required after witnessed intake of antihypertensive drugs to qualify. RDN (n=6) was performed with Symplicity Catheter System. The mean office and ambulatory BPs remained unchanged at 1, 3, and 6 months in the 6 patients, whereas there was no known change in antihypertensive medication. Two patients, however, had a fall in both office and ambulatory BPs. Our findings question whether BP falls in response to RDN in patients with true treatment-resistant hypertension. Additional research must aim to verify potential BP lowering effect and identify a priori responders to RDN before this invasive method can routinely be applied to patients with drug-resistant hypertension.

TI  - Participation in a clinical trial enhances adherence and persistence to treatment: a retrospective cohort study.
AB  - Poor adherence to treatment is one of the major determinants of an uncontrolled blood pressure. Participation in a clinical trial may increase patient's adherence to treatment. This prompted us to investigate adherence and persistence profiles in patients with hypertension who had participated in a clinical trial, by collecting pharmacy refill data before, during, and after participation in the trial. Pharmacy refill data of 182 patients with hypertension who participated in the Home Versus Office Blood Pressure Measurements: Reduction of Unnecessary Treatment Study between 2001 and 2005 were obtained from 1999 until 2010. Refill adherence to treatment was compared for the periods before, during, and after this trial. Persistence to medication was investigated for the period after termination of the trial. Refill data were available for 22 600 prescriptions. Participation into the trial significantly increased refill adherence, from 90.6% to 95.6% (P<0.001). After the trial period, refill adherence decreased again to 91.8% (P<0.001), which did not differ from the adherence before the start of the trial (P=0.45). Except for adherence to trial medication, adherence to nontrial-related drugs also increased as a consequence of trial participation, from 77.6% to 89.6% (P<0.001). After termination of the trial, median persistence was 1424 days. Participants classified as adherent (adherence: >90%) were less likely to discontinue treatment compared with nonadherent participants (odds ratio: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.45 to 0.98]). Participation in a clinical trial significantly increases adherence to both trial-related and nontrial-related treatment, suggesting that participants in a trial are more involved with their conditions and treatments.

TI  - Monitoring adherence to medication by measuring change in blood pressure.
AB  - After starting antihypertensives, blood pressure is monitored for several reasons, including assessment of adherence. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of blood pressure monitoring for detecting early nonadherence. We conducted a secondary analysis of the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), a large randomized trial of blood pressure lowering to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. We compared change in blood pressure 3 months after randomization in people who had discontinued treatment (nonadherent) with those who stayed on treatment (adherent). We also used an indirect method, assessing whether change in blood pressure discriminated between active (adherent) and placebo (nonadherent) groups. Both methods gave similar results. For the 3433 subjects, the mean (SD) of the change in systolic blood pressure was -15.8 mm Hg (SD 18.7 mm Hg) in the adherent group and -4.2 mm Hg (SD 18.1 mm Hg) in the nonadherent group. After recalibration of the mean change in the nonadherent group to 0 mm Hg and in the adherent group to -11.6 mm Hg, the absence of a fall in systolic blood pressure at 3 months had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 80% for detecting nonadherence (50% of nonadherent patients and 20% of adherent patients had a rise in blood pressure). Discriminatory power was modest over the range of cutoffs (area under the receiver-operator curve 0.67). Monitoring blood pressure is poor at detecting nonadherence to blood pressure-lowering treatment. Further research should look at other methods of assessing adherence.

TI  - Antihypertensive prescriptions for newly treated patients before and after the main antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial results and seventh report of the joint national committee on prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure guidelines.
AB  - Main results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial were published in December 2002. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, published in May 2003, recommended thiazide-type diuretics as initial pharmacological treatment alone or in combination with another drug in most patients with hypertension. To assess changes from before to after these publications, we compared antihypertensive medication prescriptions filled by patients who initiated pharmacological antihypertensive treatment in a large managed care organization during 3 time periods: (1) July 1, 2001, to June 30, 2002 (before these publications; n=1354); (2) July 1, 2003, to June 30, 2004 (to assess short-term changes; n=1542); and (3) July 1, 2004, to June 30, 2005 (to assess extended changes; n=1865). The percentage of patients initiating antihypertensive treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic increased from 30.6% to 39.4% (P<0.001) between 2001-2002 and 2003-2004, and the increase was maintained at 36.5% in 2004-2005 (P<0.001 compared with 2001-2002 and P=0.33 compared with 2003-2004). Among patients without diabetes mellitus, renal disease, a history of myocardial infarction, or heart failure, the percentage initiating pharmacological antihypertensive treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic increased from 33.1% in 2001-2002 to 43.4% in 2003-2004 (P<0.001) and remained increased (41.0%) in 2004-2005 (P<0.001 and P=0.23 compared with 2001-2002 and 2003-2004, respectively). Despite a sustained increase in the use of thiazide-type diuretics, this study indicates that an opportunity exists to increase adherence to the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines.

TI  - Characteristics of 9194 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: the LIFE study. Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension.
AB  - -Losartan was the first available orally administered selective antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint (LIFE) Reduction in Hypertension Study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of losartan with those of the beta-blocker atenolol on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Patients with essential hypertension, aged between 55 and 80 years, and ECG-documented left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were included. Altogether, 9223 patients in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the United States were randomized from June 1995 through April 1997, and 9194 remain after exclusion of a study center at which irregularities were discovered. This population of hypertensives (mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure, 174.4/97.8 mm Hg) with LVH comprises women (54.1%) and men, mostly retired from active work (mean age, 66.9 years), with a high prevalence of overweight (mean body mass index, 28.0 kg/m2), diabetes mellitus (12.3%), lipid disorders (18.0%), and symptoms or signs of coronary heart disease (15.1%). There were fewer current smokers (<17%) than in the general population, and approximately 7% were nonwhite. Almost 30% of participants had been untreated for at least 6 months when screened for the study. Only 1557 persons who entered the placebo run-in period of 14 days were excluded, predominantly because of sitting blood pressures above or below the predetermined range of 160-200/95-115 mm Hg and ECG-LVH criteria not met. By application of simple 12-lead ECG criteria for LVH (Cornell voltage QRS duration product formula plus Sokolow-Lyon voltage read by a core laboratory), hypertensive patients with LVH with an average 5-year coronary heart disease risk of 22.3% according to the Framingham score were identified. This population is now being treated (goal, <140/90 mm Hg) in adherence with the protocol for at least 4 years after final enrollment (ie, through April 2001) and until at least 1040 patients suffer myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death.

TI  - Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension.
AB  - The cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension depends on the pretreatment level of blood pressure, age and sex of the patient, presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, long-term control of blood pressure, and the annual costs of treatment. Treatment of very mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, 90-94 mm Hg), even if the benefits do exceed the risks, does not appear to be particularly cost-effective. Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of hypertension management lie in 1) avoidance of patient mislabeling by careful documentation of blood pressures on multiple occasions in the office and during usual activities outside the office before the diagnosis is made and treatment is begun; 2) efforts to increase adherence to scheduled visits and medication regimens; 3) attempts to step-down dosages or discontinue medications after periods of good blood pressure control; 4) explicit consideration of costs, as well as benefits, in decisions on the needed frequency of office visits, choice of medications, and use of laboratory tests; and 5) efforts to improve practice efficiency. Future practice guidelines for hypertension management should take these factors into account and should make trade-offs between benefits, risks, and costs explicit for specific types of patients.

TI  - Determinants of JNC VI guideline adherence, intensity of drug therapy, and blood pressure control by race and ethnicity.
AB  - The relationship between blood pressure control and racial differences in the processes of hypertension care have not been well examined. We reviewed medical records of 15 768 visits to 12 general internal medicine clinics during July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 to determine whether visits were adherent to the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) by identifying medications selected for hypertension therapy. We compared JNC adherence, blood pressure control, and intensification of therapy by patient characteristics. Using repeated measures logistic regression, we determined the adjusted odds of obtaining blood pressure control when therapy was intensified the visit before, and tested the interaction of intensification of therapy and patient race/ethnicity in predicting blood pressure control. JNC adherence was more frequent among blacks (83.7%) and Hispanics (83%) than whites (78.4%) (P<0.001). Blood pressure was controlled most often among whites (38.7% versus 34.8% for blacks and 33.3% for Hispanics; P<0.001). Blacks (81.5%) and whites (80.9%) were more likely than Hispanics (70.8%) to have therapy intensified (P=0.02). After adjustment for baseline blood pressure, intensifying therapy was associated with higher odds of subsequent blood pressure control (odds ratio, 1.55; P<0.001). There were no significant interactions between race/ethnicity and intensification in predicting control. We found that therapy intensification is associated with subsequent blood pressure control in all racial/ethnic groups and that Hispanics were least likely to have their therapy intensified. Interventions to reduce disparities in cardiovascular outcomes should consider the need to intensify drug therapy more aggressively among all high-risk populations.

TI  - An informed shared decision making programme on the prevention of myocardial infarction for patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care: protocol of a cluster randomised, controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: International and national societies claim a patient centred approach including shared decision making (SDM) in diabetes care. In a previous project, a SDM programme on the prevention of myocardial infarction has been developed. It is aimed at supporting patients with type 2 diabetes to make informed choices on preventive options, to share the decision making process with the health care team, and to improve adherence to the chosen treatment. In this study, the programme will be implemented and evaluated in primary care practices.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster randomised, controlled trial will be conducted to compare the SDM programme with standard care enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes (N = 306) from primary care practices (N = 24). The intervention programme comprises a six hours provider training, a patient decision aid including evidence-based information, a 90 minutes structured teaching session provided by medical assistants, a sheet to document the patients' individual treatment goals, and a structured consultation with the general practitioner for sharing information, setting treatment goals, and for adapting treatment regimens if necessary. Patients in the control group receive a brief extract of recommendations of the German National Disease Management Guideline on the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Primary outcome measure is adherence to blood pressure treatment and statin treatment at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures comprise informed choice and the achievement of patients' treatment goals. Analyses will be carried out on intention-to-treat basis. Concurrent qualitative methods will be used to explore the implementation processes.
AB  - DISCUSSION: At the end of this study, information on the efficacy of the SDM programme in the primary care context will be available. In addition, processes that might interfere with or that might promote a successful implementation will be identified.

TI  - Medication Routines and Adherence Among Hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - Poor adherence to prescribed medication regimens remains an important challenge preventing successful treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. While studies have documented differences in the time of day or weekday vs weekend on medication adherence, no study has examined whether having a medication-taking routine contributes to increased medication adherence. The purpose of this study was to: (1) identify patients' sociodemographic factors associated with consistent medication-taking routine; (2) examine associations between medication-taking consistency, medication adherence, and blood pressure (BP) control. The study included black patients with hypertension (n = 190; 22 men and 168 women; age, mean+/-standard deviation 54 +/- 12.08 years) who completed a practice-based randomized controlled trial. Findings showed that medication-taking consistency was significantly associated with better medication adherence (F = 9.54, P = .002). Associations with the consistency index were not statistically significant for diastolic BP control (odds ratio, 1.319; 95% confidence interval, 0.410-4.246; P = .642) and systolic BP control (odds ratio, 0.621; 95% confidence interval, 0.195-1.974; P = .419).

TI  - A centralized cardiovascular risk service to improve guideline adherence in private primary care offices.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many large health systems now employ clinical pharmacists in team-based care to assist patients and physicians with management of cardiovascular (CV) diseases. However, small private offices often lack the resources to hire a clinical pharmacist for their office. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a centralized, web-based CV risk service (CVRS) managed by clinical pharmacists will improve guideline adherence in primary care medical offices in rural and small communities.
AB  - METHODS: This study is a cluster randomized prospective trial in 12 primary care offices. Medical offices were randomized to either the CVRS intervention or usual care. The intervention will last for 12 months and all subjects will have research visits at baseline and 12 months. Primary outcomes will include adherence to treatment guidelines and control of key CV risk factors. Data will also be abstracted from the medical record at 30 months to determine if the intervention effect is sustained after it is discontinued.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study will enroll subjects through 2015 and results will be available in 2018. This study will provide information on whether a distant, centralized CV risk service can improve guideline adherence in medical offices that lack the resources to employ clinical pharmacists.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Pharmacist intervention for blood pressure control: medication intensification and adherence.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe medication adherence and medication intensification in a physician-pharmacist collaborative management (PPCM) model compared with usual care. This study was a prospective, cluster, randomized study in 32 primary care offices from 15 states. The primary outcomes were medication adherence and anti-hypertensive medication changes during the first 9 months of the intervention. The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients, 345 of which received the intervention. There was no significant difference between intervention and usual care patients in regards to medication adherence at 9 months. Intervention patients received significantly more medication changes (4.9 vs.1.1; P = .0003) and had significantly increased use of diuretics and aldosterone antagonists when compared with usual care (P = .01).The PPCM model increased medication intensification; however, no significant change in medication adherence was detected. PPCM models will need to develop non-adherence identification and intervention methods to further improve the potency of the care team. Copyright © 2015 American Society of Hypertension.

TI  - Short-term modified alternate-day fasting: a novel dietary strategy for weight loss and cardioprotection in obese adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability of modified alternate-day fasting (ADF; ie, consuming 25% of energy needs on the fast day and ad libitum food intake on the following day) to facilitate weight loss and lower vascular disease risk in obese individuals remains unknown.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of ADF that is administered under controlled compared with self-implemented conditions on body weight and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk indicators in obese adults.
AB  - DESIGN: Sixteen obese subjects (12 women, 4 men) completed a 10-wk trial, which consisted of 3 phases: 1) a 2-wk control phase, 2) a 4-wk weight loss/ADF controlled food intake phase, and 3) a 4-wk weight loss/ADF self-selected food intake phase.
AB  - RESULTS: Dietary adherence remained high throughout the controlled food intake phase (days adherent: 86%) and the self-selected food intake phase (days adherent: 89%). The rate of weight loss remained constant during controlled food intake (0.67 +/- 0.1 kg/wk) and self-selected food intake phases (0.68 +/- 0.1 kg/wk). Body weight decreased (P < 0.001) by 5.6 +/- 1.0 kg (5.8 +/- 1.1%) after 8 wk of diet. Percentage body fat decreased (P < 0.01) from 45 +/- 2% to 42 +/- 2%. Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerol concentrations decreased (P < 0.01) by 21 +/- 4%, 25 +/- 10%, and 32 +/- 6%, respectively, after 8 wk of ADF, whereas HDL cholesterol remained unchanged. Systolic blood pressure decreased (P < 0.05) from 124 +/- 5 to 116 +/- 3 mm Hg.
AB  - CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ADF is a viable diet option to help obese individuals lose weight and decrease CAD risk. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as UIC-004-2009.

TI  - Morbidity and mortality on combination versus monotherapy: a posthoc analysis of the Systolic Hypertension in Europe trial.[Erratum appears in J Hypertens. 2010 Jun;28(6):1347-8], [Erratum appears in J Hypertens. 2016 Mar;34(3):588]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current literature supports the immediate use of combinations of antihypertensive drugs in terms of ease of use and adherence, but the key issue whether combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy in the prevention of cardiovascular complications remains unproven.
AB  - METHODS: We analysed the double-blind (median follow-up 2.0 years) and open follow-up (6.0 years) phases of the Systolic Hypertension in Europe trial. Patients were 60 years or more with an entry systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 160-219/less than 95 mmHg. Antihypertensive treatment started immediately after randomization in the active-treatment group, but only after completion of the double-blind trial in control patients. Treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day). We adjusted our analyses for sex, age, history of cardiovascular complications, baseline systolic BP and previous antihypertensive treatment.
AB  - RESULTS: During the double-blind trial, adding enalapril to nitrendipine (n = 515), compared with the equivalent combination of placebos (n = 559), decreased systolic BP by a further 9.5 mmHg and reduced all cardiovascular events by 51% (P = 0.0035) and heart failure by 66% (P = 0.032), with similar trends for stroke (-51%; P = 0.066) and cardiac events (-44%; P = 0.075). Over the whole duration of follow-up, combination therapy (n = 871), compared with nitrendipine monotherapy (n = 1552), decreased systolic BP by 3.1 mmHg and reduced total mortality (-32%; P = 0.023), with similar trends for all cardiovascular events (-23%; P = 0.081) and stroke (-42%; P = 0.054).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of a posthoc analysis, but congruent with the stronger BP reduction, our results suggest that combination therapy with nitrendipine plus enalapril might improve outcome over and beyond the benefits seen with nitrendipine monotherapy.

TI  - Barnidipine real-life tolerability in arterial hypertension: results from the BASIC-HT study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Blood pressure (BP) is generally poorly controlled in hypertensive patients. One cause is poor adherence to drugs, which can be improved by treatments combining good efficacy and tolerability. Barnidipine is a strong lipophilic calcium channel blocker (CCB) with efficacy similar to other dihydropyridines.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: BASIC HT is an observational study in a large population of patients with essential hypertension to evaluate the tolerability of barnidipine in a real-life setting.
AB  - METHODS: 20479 patients were enrolled in the study. Tolerability and efficacy was assessed at 2 visits during a 3-month period. 20275 patients were included in the analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Adverse events were reported by 10.6% of the patients, leading to treatment discontinuation in 3%. Events were those expected with CCBs. The drop-out rate was 8%. Mean systolic and diastolic pressure decreased from 159.6 to 138.2 and from 92.5 to 81.7 mmHg.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The decrease in BP, is probably due to stimulation of good adherence by barnidipine.

TI  - Cardiovascular prevention in coronary heart disease patients: guidelines implementation in clinical practice.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the utilization of a clinical improvement program in stable coronary artery disease patients to increase the evidence-proven treatment utilization, and to describe the ongoing clinical practice and lifestyle change counseling.
AB  - METHODS: Cross-sectional study followed by a longitudinal component in which the tools utilization to improve clinical practice was assessed by means of additional cross-sectional data collection. 710 consecutive patients were included (Phase 1). After tools implementation, within 6 months period, 705 patients were included (Phase 2) for comparative analysis. Randomly, 318 patients from Phase 1 were selected, 6-12 months after the first evaluation (Phase 3).
AB  - RESULTS: Phase 1 to Phase 2: there were improvement on smoking cessation (P=0.019), dyslipidemia (P<0.001), hypertension and physical activity (P<0.001). There was significant difference on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors - ACEI (67.2% vs. 56.8%, P<0.001); angiotensin II receptor blockers - ARB II (25.4% vs. 32.9%, P=0.002) and beta-blocker (88.7% vs. 91.9%, P=0.047). Phase 1 to Phase 3: there was both weight (P=0.044), and blood pressure reduction (P<0.001). There was statistical significant difference on ACEI (64.8% vs. 61.6%, P=0.011) and ARB II (27.0% vs. 31.3%, P=0.035).
AB  - CONCLUSION: There was no significant change on the evidence-based pharmacological treatment utilization between pre and post-intervention phases; there was significant improvement concerning smoking and physical activity in phase 2; substantial improvement on blood pressure levels in both comparisons (Phase 1 to 2 and Phase 1 to 3). The inclusion of a case-manager for the process management was crucial for program efficacy. Comprehensive programs for clinical practice should be pursued for longer follow-up period.

TI  - Evaluating the guideline enhancement tool (GET): an innovative clinical training tool to enhance the use of hypertension guidelines in general practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative educational intervention in enhancing clinical decision making related to the management of hypertension in general practice. The relatively low level of uptake of clinical practice guidelines by clinicians is widely recognised as a problem that impacts on clinical outcomes. This project addresses this problem with a focus on hypertension guidelines. Hypertension is the most frequently managed problem in general practice but evidence suggests that management of Hypertension in general practice is sub-optimal.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This study will explore the effectiveness of an educational intervention named the 'Guideline Enhancement Tool (GET)'. The intervention is designed to guide clinicians through a systematic process of considering key decision points related to the management of hypertension and provides a mechanism for clinicians to engage with the hypertension clinical guidelines. The intervention will be administered within the Australian General Practice Training program, via one of the regional training providers. Two cohorts of trainees will participate as the intervention and delayed intervention groups. This process is expected to improve clinicians' engagement with the hypertension guidelines in particular, and enhance their clinical reasoning abilities in general. The effectiveness of the intervention in improving clinical reasoning will be evaluated using the 'Script Concordance Test'.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The study design presented in this protocol aims to achieve two major outcomes. Firstly, the trial and evaluation of the educational intervention can lead to the development of a validated clinical education strategy that can be used in GP training to enhance the decision-making processes related to the management of hypertension. This has the potential to be adapted to other clinical conditions and training programs and can benefit clinicians in their clinical decision-making. Secondly, the study explores features that influence the effective use of clinical practice guidelines. The study thus addresses a significant problem in clinical education.

TI  - Effects of intensive low-salt diet education on albuminuria among nondiabetic patients with hypertension treated with olmesartan: a single-blinded randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The antiproteinuric effect of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade can be magnified by dietary salt restriction. This study sought to determine the effect of intensive low-salt diet education on BP and urine albumin excretion in nondiabetic patients with hypertension and albuminuria.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This study was conducted between March of 2012 and March of 2013 as an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. After a run-in period of 8 weeks, all patients received the angiotensin II receptor blocker olmesartan (40 mg daily). Patients were then divided into two groups. One group was treated for another 8 weeks with angiotensin II receptor blocker plus conventional low-salt diet education, and the other group was treated for 8 weeks with angiotensin II receptor blocker plus intensive low-salt diet education. The final analyses was performed with 245 completed patients.
AB  - RESULTS: The amount of daily albuminuria was significantly decreased from 0 (566.0 [25.0-5398.6] mg/d) to 8 weeks (282.5 [16.1-4898.5] mg/d; P<0.001). From 8 to 16 weeks, the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was decreased by 36.0+/-5.9 mmol/d in the intensive education group and 8.8+/-4.9 mmol/d in the conventional education group (interaction P<0.001). Patients who completed intensive low-salt diet education exhibited greater decreases in urinary albumin excretion than the control group (change in albuminuria from 8 to 16 weeks, -154.0 versus 0.4 mg/d; P=0.01). Urinary albumin excretion tended to decrease as the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion amount decreased (R=0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.43; P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The 24-hour urinary albumin excretion was decreased more in patients in the intensive low-salt diet education group than patients in the conventional education group. Weekly intensive education on a low-salt diet would be a suitable method for clinical practice.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society of Nephrology.

TI  - Improved retention rates with low-cost interventions in hypertension and diabetes management in a rural African environment of nurse-led care: a cluster-randomised trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of low-level facility-based interventions on patient retention rates for cardiovascular (CV) disease in an environment of task shifting and nurse-led care in rural health districts in Central Cameroon.
AB  - METHODS: This study is an open-label, three-arm, cluster-randomised trial in nurse-led facilities. All three groups implemented a treatment contract. The control group (group 1) had no additional intervention, group 2 received the incentive of 1 month of free treatment every forth month of regularly respected visits, and group 3 received reminder letters in case of a missed follow-up visit. The primary outcome was patient retention at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were adherence to follow-up visit schemes and changes in blood pressure (BP) and blood glucose levels. Patients' monthly spending for drugs and transport was calculated retrospectively.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 33 centres and 221 patients were included. After 1 year, 109 patients (49.3%) remained in the programme. Retention rates in groups 2 and 3 were 60% and 65%, respectively, against 29% in the control group. The differences between the intervention groups and the control group were significant (P < 0.001), but differences between the two intervention groups were not (P = 0.719). There were no significant differences in BP or fasting plasma glucose trends between retained patients in the study groups. Average monthly cost to patients for antihypertensive medication was  1.1 +/- 0.9 and for diabetics 1.2 +/- 1.1. Transport costs to the centres were on average 1.1 +/- 1.0 for hypertensive patients and 1.1 +/- 1.6 for patients with diabetes.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Low-cost interventions suited to an environment of task shifting and nurse-led care and needing minimal additional resources can significantly improve retention rates in CV disease management in rural Africa. The combination of a treatment contract and reminder letters in case of missed appointments was an effective measure to retain patients in care.Copyright © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The influence of self-owned home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) on primary care patients with hypertension: a qualitative study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is gaining popularity among hypertensive patients. This study aimed to explore the influence of self-initiated HBPM on primary care patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Six in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted, taking into consideration the experiences of 24 primary care patients with hypertension. These patients had been using HBPM as part of their hypertension management. The overriding influences were grouped under themes which emerged from analyzing the data using the grounded theory approach.
AB  - RESULTS: There are both positive and negative influences of self-initiated HBPM. Patients used the readings of their HBPM to decide on many aspects of their hypertension management. The HBPM readings both influenced their adherence to diet and exercise and provided certain reassurance when they experienced symptoms. In addition, the act of discussing their HBPM readings with their health care providers resulted in an enhanced doctor-patient therapeutic relationship. Nevertheless, HBPM created confusion at times in some patients, particularly with regard to the target blood pressure level and the need for medication. This led to some patients making their own medical decisions based on their own standards.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: HBPM is becoming an integral part of hypertension management. Primary care patients who self-initiated HBPM reported being more self-efficacious, but lack of participation and guidance from their doctors created confusion, and hindered the true benefit of HBPM.

TI  - A trial for the use of qigong in the treatment of pre and mild essential hypertension: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and the prevalence of hypertension tends to increase with age. Current treatments for hypertension have side effects and poor adherence. Qigong has been studied as an alternative therapy for hypertension; however, the types of qigong used in those studies were diverse, and there have not been many well-designed randomized controlled trials.Our objectives are the following: 1) To evaluate the effects of qigong on blood pressure, health status and hormone levels for pre- or mild hypertension. 2) To test the methodological appropriateness of this clinical trial and calculate a sample size for future randomized trials.
AB  - METHODS: Forty subjects with pre- or mild hypertension will be randomized to either the qigong exercise group or the non-treated group. Participants in the qigong group will conduct qigong exercises 5 times per week for 8 weeks, and participants in the non-treated group will maintain their current lifestyle, including diet and exercise. The use of antihypertensive medication is not permitted. The primary endpoint is a change in patient blood pressure. Secondary endpoints are patient health status (as measured by the SF-36 and the MYMOP2 questionnaires) and changes in hormone levels, including norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This study will be the first randomized trial to investigate the effectiveness of qigong exercises for the treatment of pre- and mild hypertension. The results of this study will help to establish the optimal approach for the care of adults with pre- or mild hypertension.

TI  - Cardiovascular risk factors control in Polish patients with type 2 diabetes within the first two years of diagnosis: results of the ARETAEUS1 study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The practice guidelines of cardiological and diabetological societies emphasise that cardiovascular (CV) risk control in diabetic patients is especially important and should be stricter than in subjects without diabetes. There are little data on the frequency of meeting treatment goals in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).
AB  - AIM: To characterise Polish patients with DM2 diagnosed within the previous two years and to assess if the treatment targets from the current (2008) guidelines of Diabetes Poland regarding control of CV risk factors are met.
AB  - METHODS: ARETAEUS1 was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study conducted in various regions of Poland in 2009 (January-April). It involved 1,714 patients of all ages and both genders, who had DM2 treated for less than 24 months. They were recruited by randomly selected physicians.
AB  - RESULTS: Total cholesterol treatment goal (< 4.5 mmol/L) was met in 22% of all patients, triglycerides treatment goal (< 1.7 mmol/L) in 44%, LDL cholesterol treatment goal (< 2.6 mmol/L) in 20% and HDL cholesterol treatment goal (> 1.0 mmol/L in men and > 1.3 mmol/L in women) in 55%. Only 13% of the overall population met the goal of blood pressure (BP) below 130/80 mm Hg. When a less restrictive BP control threshold (< 140/90 mm Hg) was applied, 48% of patients had their BP below the threshold. In the analysis of subgroups (patients with and without previous CV events; receiving 1-5 or not receiving antihypertensive drugs; receiving and not receiving statins and fibrates) we observed from 0% to 3.3% of patients meeting three (HbA1c, BP and cholesterol) treatment goals. The percentages of patients meeting two out of three treatment goals were between 8% and 33% in different subgroups. The percentages of patients meeting only one out of three treatment goals ranged from 27.8% to 46.7% or at least one - from 39% to 69%.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with newly diagnosed diabetes are not meeting their treatment goals regarding control of CV risk factors, which indicates relatively low adherence to national guideline recommendations for diabetes control and primary CV prevention in DM2. Difficulties in achieving CV treatment targets in the diabetic population indicate the need for a great deal of effort on the part of clinicians and patients. Practice guidelines developers should consider what treatment targets are achievable at a reasonable expense of effort.

TI  - Technology-driven intervention to improve hypertension outcomes in community health centers.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of an electronic medical record (EMR) with clinical decision support (CDS) and performance feedback on provider adherence to guideline-recommended care and blood pressure (BP) control compared with a standard EMR alone.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Quasi-experimental with repeated measures.
AB  - METHODS: The study was conducted in a 4-site, federally qualified health center, Open Door Family Medical Centers, located in New York. The research team, Open Door leadership, providers, and staff developed and implemented a tailored multicomponent CDS system, which included a BP alert, a hypertension (HTN) order set, an HTN template, and clinical reminders. We extracted patient-level data for each encounter 17 months prior to implementation of the intervention (June 2007-October 2008) and 15 months post-intervention (April 2009-June 2010), from the EMR's data tables for all adult nonobstetric patients with a diagnosis of HTN (N = 3636).
AB  - RESULTS: Rates of HTN control were significantly greater in the post-intervention period compared with the baseline period (50.9% vs 60.8%; P <.001). Process measures, derived from the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure Guidelines, also improved significantly. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations showed that patients were 1.5 times more likely to have controlled BP post-intervention than pre-intervention. Correlates of poor BP control were black race, higher body mass index, diabetes, female gender, income, and a greater number of prescribed antihypertensive medications.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that health information technology that is implemented as part of a multicomponent quality improvement initiative can lead to improvements in HTN care and outcomes.

TI  - APPROACH-J study: design, rationale, and baseline data of the affirmation primary prevention with pravastatin in reduction of occlusive atherosclerotic complications in hypercholesterolemia--Japan study.
AB  - AIM: We investigated the relationship between the lipid levels achieved in a high-risk group of patients undergoing primary prevention with pravastatin and the incidence of cardiovascular disease, and moreover the influence of lifestyle compliance on lipid control.
AB  - METHODS: In the APPROACH-J study, 6,229 patients who were treated with pravastatin were enrolled, and will be followed for two years. The subjects are men aged 20 years or older and women aged 55 years or older (or postmenopausal women) receiving primary prevention, who are categorized as high-risk patients with 3 or more major risk factors other than the LDL-C level according to the Japan Atherosclerosis Society guideline. Achieved LDL-C levels will be used to categorize the subjects into four quartiles for this analysis, and the maximum contrast method based on the Cox proportional hazards model will be used to investigate the relations between achieved LDL-C and the incidence of vascular event. Multiple linear regression analysis will be used to investigate the relations between adherence scores and achieved lipid level.
AB  - RESULTS: In 5,871 patients (58.5% women) who were eligible for analysis, the mean age was 66.4 years. The mean LDL-C at baseline was 135.9 mg/dL. The risk factors other than LDL-C were aging in 95.4%, diabetes in 76.9%, hypertension in 72.2%, a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD) in 20.9%, smoking in 20.0%, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in 11.1%.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are expected to confirm the validity of the target LDL-C level for high-risk patients receiving primary prevention and the importance of improving adherence for primary prevention.

TI  - Ocular hypotensive effects and safety over 3 months of switching from an unfixed combination to latanoprost 0.005%/timolol maleate 0.5% fixed combination.
AB  - PURPOSE: Latanoprost 0.005%/timolol maleate 0.5% combination eye drops are now available in Japan. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prospective intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction effects and adherence with the combination eye drops in Japanese patients.
AB  - METHODS: The subjects were 162 patients (162 eyes) with glaucoma or ocular hypertension concomitantly using latanoprost 0.005% and timolol maleate 0.5% eye drops. Concomitant use of the 2 eye drops was stopped, and patients were switched to the latanoprost 0.005%/timolol maleate 0.5% combination eye drops without any washout period. IOP was measured before the switch, and at 1 and 3 months after the switch, and then compared. A questionnaire survey on adherence was also conducted 1 month after the switch.
AB  - RESULTS: IOP was the same before and after the switch: 15.2+/-3.3 mmHg before the switch, 14.9+/-3.0 mmHg 1 month after the switch, and 15.1+/-3.2 mmHg 3 months after the switch. According to the questionnaire survey, the frequency of forgetting to administer eye drops decreased with the switch, but 45.1% of the patients experienced irritation. About 82.1% replied that they preferred the latanoprost 0.005%/timolol maleate 0.5% combination eye drops. By the third month after the switch, 13 patients (8.0%) had discontinued the eye drops due to side effects or insufficient IOP reduction.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The switch from the concomitant use of latanoprost 0.005% and timolol maleate 0.5% eye drops to latanoprost 0.005%/timolol maleate 0.5% combination eye drops improved adherence and helped maintain IOP.

TI  - The effect of medical nutrition therapy on changes in dietary knowledge and DASH diet adherence in older adults with cardiovascular disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of MNT on dietary knowledge of older adults at baseline, 6 months and 12 months and to assess the effect of dietary knowledge on change in DASH diet adherence from baseline to 12 months.
AB  - DESIGN: Data for the analysis come from a controlled, randomized prospective design conducted from 2003-2005 with the outcome measures taken pre-, mid-, and post-intervention.
AB  - SETTING: Data were collected from participants in their homes in an urban community in North Carolina.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=147) were adults aged 60+ with a diagnosis of hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Intervention recipients received three sessions of MNT throughout the 1 year study period. The control group received nutrition information at enrollment.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed a dietary knowledge questionnaire and a 24 dietary recall at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Instrumental variables models with participant fixed effects were used to determine the impact of MNT on dietary knowledge and dietary knowledge on DASH diet adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Among those who received MNT, dietary knowledge increased from baseline to twelve months (p<.01). Changes in dietary knowledge were not associated with changes in DASH adherence from baseline to 12 months (p=0.44).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The MNT administered was effective at improving dietary knowledge, but not at improving DASH adherence. Three MNT sessions may be insufficient to change behavior. Integrating behavioral change theory and cultural sensitivity to MNT may improve diet adherence among diverse older adults.

TI  - Specialty outpatient care of diabetic patients in Poland--are we far from treatment targets? Rationale, design, and preliminary results of the OPTIMO study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: While clinical practice guidelines reflect the best known evidence-based approach to patient care, it is individual clinicians and patients who make decisions and treatment choices, and individual patients who actually achieve (or not) the treatment goals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to describe the population of diabetic patients attending specialty outpatient clinics, to characterize the management of patients with different types of diabetes, and to assess the accordance of management with the recommendations developed by Diabetes Poland.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: The OPTIMO observational study was conducted from 2006 to 2009 and included patients with diabetes diagnosed according to the 1999 World Health Organization criteria who were observed for 1 to 3 years, with control visits at least every 6 months. Participating physicians used pocket PCs equipped with specially developed software to collect patients' data and to provide educational reminders to clinicians.
AB  - RESULTS: The final analysis involved 9600 patients for whom valid baseline questionnaires were available. Type 2 diabetes was observed in 92% and type 1 diabetes in 6% of the patients. Mean age was 60.5 years. Women constituted 54% of the population. Coronary heart disease was observed in 32% and arterial hypertension in 76% of the patients. At baseline, 23% of the patients had hemoglobin A1c level below 6.5% and 44% below 7.0. Total cholesterol and triglycerides treatment goals were met at baseline by slightly more than half of the patients, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goal was met only by 33% of the patients. Baseline blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg was reported for 11% of the patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: At the beginning of the OPTIMO study, we have observed considerable deviations from treatment targets recommended by current clinical practice guidelines for diabetic patients, which leaves significant room for improvement in the care of diabetic patients.

TI  - Community Outreach and Cardiovascular Health (COACH) Trial: a randomized, controlled trial of nurse practitioner/community health worker cardiovascular disease risk reduction in urban community health centers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite well-publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, the implementation of risk-reducing practices remains poor. This report describes the results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a comprehensive program of cardiovascular disease risk reduction delivered by nurse practitioner /community health worker (NP/CHW) teams versus enhanced usual care (EUC) to improve lipids, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and patient perceptions of the quality of their chronic illness care in patients in urban community health centers.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 525 patients with documented cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension and levels of LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, or HbA1c that exceeded goals established by national guidelines were randomly assigned to NP/CHW (n=261) or EUC (n=264) groups. The NP/CHW intervention included aggressive pharmacological management and tailored educational and behavioral counseling for lifestyle modification and problem solving to address barriers to adherence and control. Compared with EUC, patients in the NP/CHW group had significantly greater 12-month improvement in total cholesterol (difference, 19.7 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (difference,15.9 mg/dL), triglycerides (difference, 16.3 mg/dL), systolic blood pressure (difference, 6.2 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (difference, 3.1 mm Hg), HbA1c (difference, 0.5%), and perceptions of the quality of their chronic illness care (difference, 1.2 points).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: An intervention delivered by an NP/CHW team using individualized treatment regimens based on treat-to-target algorithms can be an effective approach to improve risk factor status and perceptions of chronic illness care in high-risk patients.

TI  - Comparison of primary care models in the prevention of cardiovascular disease - a cross sectional study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary care providers play an important role in preventing and managing cardiovascular disease. This study compared the quality of preventive cardiovascular care delivery amongst different primary care models.
AB  - METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a larger randomized control trial, known as the Improved Delivery of Cardiovascular Care (IDOCC) through Outreach Facilitation. Using baseline data collected through IDOCC, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 82 primary care practices from three delivery models in Eastern Ontario, Canada: 43 fee-for-service, 27 blended-capitation and 12 community health centres with salary-based physicians. Medical chart audits from 4,808 patients with or at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease were used to examine each practice's adherence to ten evidence-based processes of care for diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, weight management, and smoking cessation care. Generalized estimating equation models adjusting for age, sex, rurality, number of cardiovascular-related comorbidities, and year of data collection were used to compare guideline adherence amongst the three models.
AB  - RESULTS: The percentage of patients with diabetes that received two hemoglobin A1c tests during the study year was significantly higher in community health centres (69%) than in fee-for-service (45%) practices (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.4 [95% CI 1.4-4.2], p = 0.001). Blended capitation practices had a significantly higher percentage of patients who had their waistlines monitored than in fee-for-service practices (19% vs. 5%, AOR = 3.7 [1.8-7.8], p = 0.0006), and who were recommended a smoking cessation drug when compared to community health centres (33% vs. 16%, AOR = 2.4 [1.3-4.6], p = 0.007). Overall, quality of diabetes care was higher in community health centres, while smoking cessation care and weight management was higher in the blended-capitation models. Fee-for-service practices had the greatest gaps in care, most noticeably in diabetes care and weight management.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the evidence suggesting that primary care delivery model impacts quality of care. These findings support current Ontario reforms to move away from the traditional fee-for-service practice.

TI  - Design, rationale, and baseline characteristics of a cluster randomized controlled trial of pay for performance for hypertension treatment: study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite compelling evidence of the benefits of treatment and well-accepted guidelines for treatment, hypertension is controlled in less than one-half of United States citizens.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial tests whether explicit financial incentives promote the translation of guideline-recommended care for hypertension into clinical practice and improve blood pressure (BP) control in the primary care setting. Using constrained randomization, we assigned 12 Veterans Affairs hospital outpatient clinics to four study arms: physician-level incentive; group-level incentive; combination of physician and group incentives; and no incentives (control). All participants at the hospital (cluster) were assigned to the same study arm. We enrolled 83 full-time primary care physicians and 42 non-physician personnel. The intervention consisted of an educational session about guideline-recommended care for hypertension, five audit and feedback reports, and five disbursements of incentive payments. Incentive payments rewarded participants for chart-documented use of guideline-recommended antihypertensive medications, BP control, and appropriate responses to uncontrolled BP during a prior four-month performance period over the 20-month intervention. To identify potential unintended consequences of the incentives, the study team interviewed study participants, as well as non-participant primary care personnel and leadership at study sites. Chart reviews included data collection on quality measures not related to hypertension. To evaluate the persistence of the effect of the incentives, the study design includes a washout period.
AB  - DISCUSSION: We briefly describe the rationale for the interventions being studied, as well as the major design choices. Rigorous research designs such as the one described here are necessary to determine whether performance-based payment arrangements such as financial incentives result in meaningful quality improvements.

TI  - A randomized trial to improve patient-centered care and hypertension control in underserved primary care patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: African Americans and persons with low socioeconomic status (SES) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and receive less patient-centered care than less vulnerable patient populations. Moreover, continuing medical education (CME) and patient-activation interventions have infrequently been directed to improve the processes of care for these populations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of patient-centered interventions targeting patients and physicians with the effectiveness of minimal interventions for underserved groups.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted from January 2002 through August 2005, with patient follow-up at 3 and 12 months, in 14 urban, community-based practices in Baltimore, Maryland.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one primary care physicians and 279 hypertension patients.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Physician communication skills training and patient coaching by community health workers.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Physician communication behaviors; patient ratings of physicians' participatory decision-making (PDM), patient involvement in care (PIC), reported adherence to medications; systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and BP control.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Visits of trained versus control group physicians demonstrated more positive communication change scores from baseline (-0.52 vs. -0.82, p = 0.04). At 12 months, the patient+physician intensive group compared to the minimal intervention group showed significantly greater improvements in patient report of physicians' PDM (beta = +6.20 vs. -5.24, p = 0.03) and PIC dimensions related to doctor facilitation (beta = +0.22 vs. -0.17, p = 0.03) and information exchange (beta = +0.32 vs. -0.22, p = 0.005). Improvements in patient adherence and BP control did not differ across groups for the overall patient sample. However, among patients with uncontrolled hypertension at baseline, non-significant reductions in systolic BP were observed among patients in all intervention groups-the patient+physician intensive (-13.2 mmHg), physician intensive/patient minimal (-10.6 mmHg), and the patient intensive/physician minimal (-16.8 mmHg), compared to the patient+physician minimal group (-2.0 mmHg).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Interventions that enhance physicians' communication skills and activate patients to participate in their care positively affect patient-centered communication, patient perceptions of engagement in care, and may improve systolic BP among urban African-American and low SES patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - Frequency and correlates of treatment intensification for elevated cholesterol levels in patients with cardiovascular disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although current performance measures define low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels <100 mg/dL in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) as good quality, they provide a snapshot and do not address whether treatment intensification was performed to manage elevated LDL-C levels.
AB  - METHODS: We determined the proportion of patients with CVD (n = 22,888) with LDL-C <100 mg/dL and the proportion with uncontrolled LDL-C levels (>100 mg/dL) who received treatment intensification within the 45-day follow-up in a Veterans Affairs Network. We evaluated facility, provider, and patient correlates of treatment intensification.
AB  - RESULTS: Low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels were at goal in 16,350 (71.4%) patients. An additional 2,093 (one third of those eligible for treatment intensification) received treatment intensification. Controlling for clustering between facilities and patient's illness severity: history of diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.32), hypertension (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.42), good medication adherence (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.91-2.54), and a higher number of lipid panels (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.14-1.27) were associated with treatment intensification. Patients older than 75 years (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.56-0.75) and women (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43-1.00) were less likely to receive treatment intensification. Teaching status of the facility, physician or specialist primary care provider, and patient's race were not associated with treatment intensification.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Only one third of the CVD patients with elevated LDL-C received treatment intensification. Diabetic and hypertensive patients were more likely to receive treatment intensification, whereas, older patients, female patients, and patients with poor medication adherence were less likely to receive treatment intensification. Our findings highlight areas for quality improvement initiatives.Copyright © 2011 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Measurement of adherence to brimonidine therapy for glaucoma using electronic monitoring.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the patient adherence and behavior with brimonidine twice daily (bid) or 3 times daily (tid) in patients used to topical glaucoma medication.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-five patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled in a prospective, observational cohort study. Consenting patients were randomly assigned to brimonidine bid or tid and received conventional brimonidine eye drops with attached electronic monitoring devices for 4 weeks. Patients were not explicitly informed on the compliance monitoring.
AB  - RESULTS: The study was completed by 67 patients (89%). In 65 patients (97%), at least 1 dosing interval exceeded 24 hours. The mean adherence rates were better in the brimonidine bid group (72 +/- 19% vs. 62 +/- 16%, P=0.04), although dosing frequency was higher in the tid group (1.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.4 per day; P<0.001). On average medication coverage was 70% for the bid group and 67% for the tid group; 19 patients (28%) had a coverage rate above 75%, 42 patients (63%) 50% to 75%, and 6 (9%) below 50%. Patients with normal-tension glaucoma had lower coverage rates than patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension (P<0.05). Data also showed that on average 20% of the glaucoma medication was wasted owing to inefficient drug delivery by using more than 1 drop per dosing.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Individual adherence with brimonidine was highly variable and pharmacologically insufficient for more than two-third of the patients. Special attention should be paid to compliance of patients with normal-tension glaucoma. Our findings underline the need to improve individual adherence and drug delivery in topical glaucoma therapy.

TI  - The counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension (CAATCH) Trial: baseline demographic, clinical, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effectiveness of combined physician and patient-level interventions for blood pressure (BP) control in low-income, hypertensive African Americans with multiple co-morbid conditions remains largely untested in community-based primary care practices. Demographic, clinical, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics of participants in the Counseling African American to Control Hypertension (CAATCH) Trial are described. CAATCH evaluates the effectiveness of a multi-level, multi-component, evidence-based intervention compared with usual care (UC) in improving BP control among poorly controlled hypertensive African Americans who receive primary care in Community Health Centers (CHCs).
AB  - METHODS: Participants included 1,039 hypertensive African Americans receiving care in 30 CHCs in the New York Metropolitan area. Baseline data on participant demographic, clinical (e.g., BP, anti-hypertensive medications), psychosocial (e.g., depression, medication adherence, self-efficacy), and behavioral (e.g., exercise, diet) characteristics were gathered through direct observation, chart review, and interview.
AB  - RESULTS: The sample was primarily female (71.6%), middle-aged (mean age = 56.9 +/- 12.1 years), high school educated (62.4%), low-income (72.4% reporting less than $20,000/year income), and received Medicaid (35.9%) or Medicare (12.6%). Mean systolic and diastolic BP were 150.7 +/- 16.7 mm Hg and 91.0 +/- 10.6 mm Hg, respectively. Participants were prescribed an average of 2.5 +/- 1.9 antihypertensive medications; 54.8% were on a diuretic; 33.8% were on a beta blocker; 41.9% were on calcium channel blockers; 64.8% were on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). One-quarter (25.6%) of the sample had resistant hypertension; one-half (55.7%) reported medication non-adherence. Most (79.7%) reported one or more co-morbid medical conditions. The majority of the patients had a Charlson Co-morbidity score > 2. Diabetes mellitus was common (35.8%), and moderate/severe depression was present in 16% of participants. Participants were sedentary (835.3 +/- 1,644.2 Kcal burned per week), obese (59.7%), and had poor global physical health, poor eating habits, high health literacy, and good overall mental health.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients in the CAATCH trial exhibited adverse lifestyle behaviors, and had significant medical and psychosocial barriers to adequate BP control. Trial outcomes will shed light on the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions for BP control when implemented in real-world medical settings that serve high numbers of low-income hypertensive African-Americans with multiple co-morbidity and significant barriers to behavior change.

AB  - AIMS: To examine the multilevel (patient- and physician-level) determinants of blood pressure and residual total cardiovascular risk outcomes associated with second-line valsartan therapy.
AB  - METHODS: The BSCORE study was a prospective, multi-centre, pharmacoepidemiological study of the "real-world" effectiveness of second-line valsartan with or without hydrochlorothiazide.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 3497 patients were recruited by 354 physicians. Mean age was 63.8+/-12.0 years; 52.3% were male; 20.9% were smokers; 47.7% were dyslipidaemic; and 23.6% had diabetes. On average, reductions in blood pressure and increases in the proportions of patients with controlled blood pressure after 90 days were statistically significant (all P<0.001). Twenty-one percent of systolic blood pressure and 25.6% of diastolic blood pressure variability at follow-up was attributable to physician-level characteristics. Significant reductions in total cardiovascular risk were observed (P<0.001); with 12.5% of the variability in total cardiovascular risk change attributable to physician-level characteristics. Several independent determinants of blood pressure outcomes were identified, many of which are modifiable.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Second-line valsartan therapy improves blood pressure outcomes under variable real-world conditions, and is associated with a decrease in total cardiovascular risk. Optimizing antihypertensive effectiveness, including the reduction of residual cardiovascular risk, involves managing concomitant conditions and risk factors, improving adherence, and identifying physician-level factors amenable to intervention.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Preventing recurrence of thromboembolic events through coordinated treatment in the District of Columbia.
AB  - RATIONALE: PROTECT DC examines whether stroke navigators can improve cardiovascular risk factors in urban underserved individuals newly hospitalized for stroke or ischemic attack. Within one-year of hospital discharge, up to one-third of patients no longer adhere to secondary prevention behaviors. Adherence rates are lower in minority-underserved groups, contributing to health disparities. In-hospital programs increase use of stroke prevention therapies but may not be as successful in underserved individuals. In these groups, low literacy, limited healthcare access, and sparse community resources may reduce adherence. Lay community health workers (navigators) improve adherence in other illnesses through education and assisting in overcoming barriers to achieving desired health behaviors and obtaining needed healthcare services.
AB  - AIMS AND DESIGN: PROTECT DC is a Phase II, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing in-hospital education plus stroke navigators to usual care. Atherogenic ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack survivors are recruited from Washington, DC hospitals. Navigators meet with participants during the index hospitalization, perform home visits, and meet by phone. They focus on stroke education, medication compliance, and overcoming practical barriers to adherence. The interventions are driven by the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior.
AB  - STUDY OUTCOMES: The primary dependent measure is a summary score of four objective measures of stroke risk factor control: systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, hemoglobin Hb A1C, and antiplatelet agent pill counts. Secondary outcomes include stroke knowledge, exercise, dietary modification, and smoking cessation.
AB  - CONCLUSION: PROTECT DC will determine whether a Phase III trial of stroke navigation for urban underserved individuals to improve adherence to secondary stroke prevention behaviors is warranted.Copyright © 2011 The Authors. International Journal of Stroke © 2011 World Stroke Organization.

TI  - Prospective analysis of LDL-C goal achievement and self-reported medication adherence among statin users in primary care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improvements in the control of LDL-C levels have occurred in the past decade due to the introduction of increasingly potent statins, such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Many patients, however, do not achieve their LDL-C goals, which presents a practical dilemma for clinicians and highlights the need to identify adherence problems in a clinically relevant manner.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between LDL-C goal achievement and both medication adherence and beliefs assessed using structured questioning.
AB  - METHODS: All patients were aged >40 years and participated in the cardiovascular risk factor management program STOP-HF (St. Vincent's Screening To Prevent Heart Failure study). One hundred and eighty-five participants who had been prescribed statins, split between those who achieved and those who did not achieve LDL-C goal, were randomly selected for a prospective study examining the relationship between adherence, assessed by the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS), and LDL-C goal achievement. Patients' beliefs about medicines were assessed using the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire-General (BMQ-G). Main outcome measures were predictors of LDL-C goal achievement and medication adherence and predictors of adherence among patients using the MMAS.
AB  - RESULTS: The average age of the selected patients was 64.9 (9.9) years; 45% were male, 46% had hypertension, 17.5% had coronary artery disease, and 10% had diabetes. Questionnaires were answered by 119 patients, 71 of whom (59.7%) were goal achievers. LDL-C goal achievers were more likely to respond to the questionnaires than nonachievers (76.8% vs 52.7%; P = 0.002). Fifty-eight respondents (48.7%) reported that they were not fully adherent to medication and in multivariable analysis were twice as likely to miss LDL-C goal compared with those who were adherent. Approximately 25% of patients who reported nonadherence were intentionally so. Patients' beliefs about medicines were a significant predictor of self-reported adherence but not of LDL-C goal achievement.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Medication nonadherence may be responsible for failure to achieve goal in many patients who are prescribed statins. In routine clinical care, the structured MMAS questionnaire may provide clinicians with an effective tool to assess medication nonadherence in the context of statin therapy failure.

TI  - Management of atrial fibrillation by primary care physicians in Germany: baseline results of the ATRIUM registry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In contrast to surveys in cardiologist settings, presentation and management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in primary care patients is less well studied.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: The prospective ATRIUM (Outpatient Registry Upon Morbidity of Atrial Fibrillation) collected data from patients with AF seen by 730 physicians representing a random sample of all primary care physicians in Germany. ATRIUM enrolled 3,667 patients (mean age, 72 +/- 9 years; 58% male, mean CHADS(2) score 2.2 +/- 1.3), 994 (27.1%) with paroxysmal, 944 (25.7%) with persistent or long-standing persistent and 1,525 (41.6%) with permanent AF (no AF type was specified in 204 patients). Mean duration since initial diagnosis of AF was 61 +/- 66 months (median 42, interquartile range 14-88). Reported symptoms included palpitations (43%), shortness of breath (49%), fatigue (49%), dizziness (37%) and angina (20%). Most common concomitant conditions were hypertension (84%), heart failure (43%), coronary artery disease (345%), diabetes (35%) and chronic kidney disease (20%). Prior myocardial infarction was present in 11% of patients, prior stroke in 10% and prior transient ischemic attack in 10%. Antithrombotic medication was used by 93% of the patients (oral anticoagulants, 83%). Rate control therapy was reported in 75% and rhythm control therapy in 33%, often added to rate control. Drugs for rhythm and rate control included s-blockers (75%), calcium antagonists (15%), digitalis (29%), sodium channel blockers of type IA (quinidine, 1.0%) or IC (flecainide or propafenone, 5%), and potassium channel blockers including amiodarone (11%). In the year prior to enrollment, 46% of the patients had been cardioverted (23% by drugs, 22% electrically), catheter ablation had been performed in 5%, and 10% received a pacemaker or defibrillator. A high proportion (44%) of the patients were hospitalized in the year prior to enrollment.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AF managed in primary care often receive guideline-conforming therapy including antithrombotic therapy, rate control and rhythm control (numbers given above). Despite this apparent adherence, almost half of the patients were hospitalized in the year prior to enrollment, suggesting that the therapies applied do not stabilize patients sufficiently to keep them out of hospital.

TI  - Change in antihypertensive drug prescribing after guideline implementation: a controlled before and after study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antihypertensive drug choices and treatment levels are not in accordance with the existing guidelines. We aimed to assess the impact of a guideline implementation intervention on antihypertensive drug prescribing.
AB  - METHODS: In this controlled before and after study, the effects of a multifaceted (education, audit and feedback, local care pathway) quality programme was evaluated. The intervention was carried out in a health centre between 2002 and 2003. From each health care unit (n = 31), a doctor-nurse pair was trained to act as peer facilitators in the intervention.All antihypertensive drugs prescribed by 25 facilitator general practitioners (intervention GPs) and 53 control GPs were retrieved from the nationwide Prescription Register for three-month periods in 2001 and 2003. The proportions of patients receiving specific antihypertensive drugs and multiple antihypertensive drugs were measured before and after the intervention for three subgroups of hypertension patients: hypertension only, with coronary heart disease, and with diabetes.
AB  - RESULTS: In all subgroups, the use of multiple concurrent medications increased. For intervention patients with hypertension only, the odds ratio (OR) was 1.12 (95% CI 0.99, 1.25; p = 0.06) and for controls 1.13 (1.05, 1.21; p = 0.002). We observed no statistically significant differences in the change in the prescribing of specific antihypertensive agents between the intervention and control groups. The use of agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system increased in all subgroups (hypertension only intervention patients OR 1.19 (1.06, 1.34; p = 0.004) and controls OR 1.24 (1.15, 1.34; p < 0.0001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted guideline implementation intervention does not necessarily lead to significant changes in prescribing performance. Rigorous planning of the interventions and quality projects and their evaluation are essential.

TI  - Participation in a clinical trial enhances adherence and persistence to treatment: a retrospective cohort study.
AB  - Poor adherence to treatment is one of the major determinants of an uncontrolled blood pressure. Participation in a clinical trial may increase patient's adherence to treatment. This prompted us to investigate adherence and persistence profiles in patients with hypertension who had participated in a clinical trial, by collecting pharmacy refill data before, during, and after participation in the trial. Pharmacy refill data of 182 patients with hypertension who participated in the Home Versus Office Blood Pressure Measurements: Reduction of Unnecessary Treatment Study between 2001 and 2005 were obtained from 1999 until 2010. Refill adherence to treatment was compared for the periods before, during, and after this trial. Persistence to medication was investigated for the period after termination of the trial. Refill data were available for 22 600 prescriptions. Participation into the trial significantly increased refill adherence, from 90.6% to 95.6% (P<0.001). After the trial period, refill adherence decreased again to 91.8% (P<0.001), which did not differ from the adherence before the start of the trial (P=0.45). Except for adherence to trial medication, adherence to nontrial-related drugs also increased as a consequence of trial participation, from 77.6% to 89.6% (P<0.001). After termination of the trial, median persistence was 1424 days. Participants classified as adherent (adherence: >90%) were less likely to discontinue treatment compared with nonadherent participants (odds ratio: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.45 to 0.98]). Participation in a clinical trial significantly increases adherence to both trial-related and nontrial-related treatment, suggesting that participants in a trial are more involved with their conditions and treatments.

TI  - Non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension in primary health care: a comparative clinical trial of two education strategies in health and nutrition.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension represents a serious challenge for public health policies in several countries. This study was conducted to compare two intervention strategies regarding the adherence of adult women to dietary changes recommended for the treatment of hypertension in a community covered by Primary Health Care Unit.
AB  - METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled trial of a sample composed of 28 women with hypertension enrolled in the Primary Health Care Unit located in the urban area of southeastern Brazil. The participants were already undergoing treatment for hypertension but devoid of nutritional care; and were divided into two groups, each composed of 14 individuals, who received interventions that consisted of two different strategies of nutritional guidance: monthly health education workshops alone (Group 1) and combined with family orientation through home visits (Group 2). Adherence to nutritional guidelines was evaluated by dietary, anthropometric, clinical and serum biochemical parameters, measured before and after the interventions. Knowledge on control and risk of hypertension was also investigated. The study lasted five months.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean age was 55.6 (+/- 2.8) and 50.7 (+/- 6.5) in the groups 1 and 2, respectively. The home orientation strategy promoted greater adherence to dietary changes, leading to a statistically significant improvement in the clinical, anthropometric, biochemical and dietary parameters. The group 2 reduced the consumption of risk foods (p = 0.01), oil (p = 0.002) and sugar (p = 0.02), and decreased body mass index (-0.7 kg/m2; p = 0.01); waist circumference (-4.2 cm; p = 0.001), systolic blood pressure (-13 mm HG; p = 0.004) and glycemia (-18.9 mg/dl; p = 0. 01). In group 1 only waist circumference (-2 cm; p = 0.01) changed significantly.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Nutritional orientations at the household level were more effective with regard to the adherence of individuals to non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension, regarding the reduction of clinical and behavioral risk parameters.

TI  - Silicone punctal plugs as an adjunctive therapy for open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary open-angle glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy that can cause an irreversible loss of vision. A reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) is beneficial in slowing or halting its progression. Once-per-day monotherapy glaucoma medications, such as prostaglandin analogues, are effective in lowering IOP while maintaining patients' adherence. Achieving the desired target IOP often requires multiple medications. The present study evaluates punctal occlusion of both the inferior and superior puncta as an adjunctive therapy to travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% for patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in order to reduce IOP.
AB  - METHODS: Thirteen patients who were using travoprost 0.004% ophthalmic solution for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension received silicone punctal plugs in the superior and inferior puncta of one eye. After one month, the IOP was remeasured. The percentage change of the IOP from the baseline was analysed by using a paired sample t-test.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean baseline IOP was 19.82 +/- 1.19 mmHg in the test eyes and 18.32 +/- 1.11 mmHg in the control eyes. The mean IOP at the one-month visit was 18.23 +/- 1.17 mmHg in the test eyes and 18.45 +/- 1.04 mmHg in the control eyes. The test eyes demonstrated a decrease in IOP of 1.59 (+/- 0.95) mmHg from the baseline, or a 6.82 per cent decrease in the IOP from the baseline. The control eyes had an increase in IOP of 0.14 +/- 0.77 mmHg from the baseline, or a 1.91 per cent increase in the IOP. The relative difference in the IOP between the test eyes and the control eyes at the one-month visit was 1.73 mmHg, or 8.74 per cent.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, punctal occlusion offers a statistically and clinically significant decrease in IOP when it is used as an adjunctive therapy to travoprost 0.004% for patients who are suffering from open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.Copyright © 2011 The Authors.

TI  - [Efficacy of fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan in hospitalized patients with hypertensive disease]. [Russian]
AB  - Efficacy and tolerability of fixed amlodipine/valsartan combination was studied in 86 patients with hypertensive disease hospitalized in departments of general internal medicine or cardiology. All patients had indications for antihypertensive therapy and were randomized either to fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (n=43) or to therapy which corresponded to the hospital formulary (n=43). Correction of antihypertensive therapy was performed by treating physician at daily rounds. Self-control of blood pressure (BP) was performed by patients with the use of UA767PC apparatus. Results of BP self-control were compared with clinical measurements in order to detect concealed inefficacy of treatment. Results. Rate of achievement of target BP with fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (93%) was comparable with that on traditional therapy (90%). But the use of fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan compared with traditional therapy was associated with lower clinical and self measured BP, quicker achievement of target BP (5.8+/-2.3 and 9.2+/-1.8 days, respectively, p<0.05), lesser number of antihypertensive drugs (2.5+/-0.6 and 3.0+/-0.9 days, respectively), lower rate of concealed inefficacy of treatment (12 and 31%, respectively, p<0.05). Conclusions. We have demonstrated appropriateness of inhospital administration of fixed amlodipine/valsartan combination as an approach allowing to achieve target BP in shorter time, with the use of fewer antihypertensive drugs, and diminishing concealed inefficacy of treatment.

TI  - Device-guided paced respiration as an adjunctive therapy for hypertension in obstructive sleep apnea: a pilot feasibility study.
AB  - Data suggest that device-guided paced respiration (<10 breaths/min) may reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients. We hypothesized that daily device-guided slow breathing may lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In this one-arm pilot study, we enrolled 25 subjects with hypertension and OSA. Subjects were asked to perform device-guided paced respiration 30 min a day for 8 weeks. Our primary outcome was change in office systolic and diastolic blood pressures from baseline to 8 weeks. Twenty-four subjects completed the study. Mean baseline blood pressure was 140.0 +/- 10.2 mmHg systolic and 82.7 +/- 8.9 mmHg diastolic. Complete device data were available for 17 subjects. Mean device adherence was 81 +/- 24% and 51% achieved a mean breath rate <10 breaths/min over 8 weeks. Three subjects had changes in their anti-hypertensive medications during the study. Among the remaining 21 subjects, mean difference in office blood pressure from baseline to 8 weeks was -9.6 +/- 11.8 mmHg systolic (p < 0.01) and -2.52 +/- 8.9 mmHg diastolic (p = 0.21). Device-guided paced respiration may lower systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension and OSA; however, our findings need to be confirmed with larger randomized controlled trials.

TI  - The influence of cognition, anxiety and psychiatric disorders over treatment adherence in uncontrolled hypertensive patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence is estimated to cause 125 thousand deaths per year and is linked to 10% of all hospital stays in the U.S. Up to one third of elderly hypertensive patients don't have adherence, which is responsible for high proportion of hospitalizations. Hypertension is also related to poor performance in tests that assess cognitive functions. On the other hand, poor cognitive performance is associated with low adherence to treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between cognitive function, anxiety and psychiatric disorders with adherence to drug treatment in patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This a cohort studies with 56 adult patients with uncontrolled hypertension who participated of all meetings of a pharmaceutical intervention in a randomized clinical trial of pharmaceutical care. Cognitive function was measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (Mini-mental). The memory was measured by digit and word spans, tower and church shadow test, short story test and metamemory. Anxiety and psychiatric disorders were evaluated by the State Trace Anxiety Inventory and the Self-Report Questionnaire, respectively. The participants were classified as adherent or non-adherent to the drug treatment, according to the identification of plasma levels of hydrochlorothiazide. All non-adherent patients (n = 12) and 35 out 44 (79.5%) patients with adherence to treatment had at least one memory test with an altered score (P = 0.180). Participants with an unsatisfactory score in the Mini-mental had six-fold higher risk of non-adherence to treatment when compared to those with a normal score (RR = 5.8; CI 95%: 1.6-20.8; P = 0.007). The scores of anxiety and psychiatric disorders were not associated with adherence to the pharmacological treatment.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Cognitive deficit impairs adherence to drug therapy and should be screened as part of a program of pharmaceutical care to improve adherence to treatment.

TI  - Combination therapy as initial treatment for newly diagnosed hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends that clinicians consider the use of multidrug therapy to increase likelihood of achieving blood pressure goal. Little is known about recent patterns of combination antihypertensive therapy use in patients being initiated on hypertension treatment.
AB  - METHODS: We investigated combination antihypertensive therapy use in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients from the Cardiovascular Research Network Hypertension Registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between combination antihypertensive therapy and 12-month blood pressure control.
AB  - RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2007, a total of 161,585 patients met criteria for incident hypertension and were initiated on treatment. During the study period, an increasing proportion of patients were treated initially with combination rather than with single-agent therapy (20.7% in 2002 compared with 35.8% in 2007, P < .001). This increase in combination therapy use was more pronounced in patients with stage 2 hypertension, whose combination therapy use increased from 21.6% in 2002 to 44.5% in 2007. Nearly 90% of initial combination therapy was accounted for by 2 combinations, a thiazide and a potassium-sparing diuretic (47.6%) and a thiazide and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (41.4%). After controlling for relevant clinical factors, including subsequent intensification of treatment and medication adherence, combination therapy was associated with increased odds of blood pressure control at 12 months (odds ratio compared with single-drug initial therapy 1.20; 95% CI 1.15-1.24, P < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Initial treatment of hypertension with combination therapy is increasingly common and is associated with better long-term blood pressure control.Copyright © 2011 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Determining the difference in medication compliance between the general patient population and patients receiving antihypertensive therapy: a case study.
AB  - This study addressed the issue of medication compliance in general, compliance with antihypertensive therapy, and the relationship between these two groups. In addition to determining the reasons for noncompliance with therapy prescription, the aim of this study was to also establish whether it was considered feasible by the patients to comply with their physician's instructions and whether the patients believed that the prescribed therapy was beneficial to their health. Hypertensive patients were compared to the total study population according to age groups. The study was designed as a cross-sectional survey with the use of a 33-item self-administered questionnaire. The study included 635 individuals who were collecting or buying drugs for the treatment of chronic diseases, with special reference to subjects taking antihypertensive agents (n = 361). More than half (n = 361; 56.9%) of the 635 study subjects were on therapy for arterial hypertension and possibly for some other diseases. The great majority of study subjects reported forgetfulness as the main reason for skipping drug doses. Comparison between the total study population and the subjects treated for arterial hypertension according to age groups (compliant, noncompliant and all together) yielded no statistically significant difference. We concluded that there was no difference in medication compliance between the general patient population and patients receiving antihypertensive therapy and there was no correlation between medication compliance and age.

TI  - Persistence with a single pill versus two pills of amlodipine and atorvastatin: the Australian experience, 2006-2010.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study patient persistence on therapy for hypertension and dyslipidaemia using a single-pill combination compared with a two-pill approach.
AB  - DESIGN AND SETTING: Post-hoc observational assessment of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme claim records covering the period April 2005 to March 2010.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A 10% random sample of Australian long-term concession card holders was analysed. The patients studied had commenced on either amlodipine and atorvastatin as two individual pills, or a single pill containing both amlodipine and atorvastatin (AA), with neither combined approach having been dispensed to them in the previous 6 months.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportions of patients failing to fill their first repeat prescription after 1 month or failing to persist with treatment at 12 months, and the median persistence time (MPT) were measured.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 4146 patients prescribed the AA single pill, 11% failed to fill the first repeat prescription and 33% had ceased treatment by 12 months (MPT, 35 months). Of 6204 patients prescribed amlodipine and atorvastatin as two pills, 23% failed to fill the first repeat prescriptions and 59% had ceased treatment by 12 months (MPT, 7 months). In a multivariate model, cessation of single-pill therapy increased by 165% if there was no prior therapy, but only increased by 48%-55% if there was no prior therapy with a calcium channel blocker or statin. MPT on the single pill was 8 months in those without prior antihypertensive therapy, but was > 37 months in those with any prior antihypertensive therapy.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A single-pill combination drug is associated with superior long-term persistence compared with two-pill therapy in the management of hypertension and dyslipidaemia.

AB  - Hypertension is prevalent in the United States and remains uncontrolled. The primary objective of the study was to determine the effect of once-daily dosing of a combination therapy for blood pressure (BP) and dyslipidemia using home BP monitoring on reaching clinical BP and the effect of daily dosing of combination therapy on reaching lipid goals. The study was conducted in middle-aged, indigent, African Americans who had high-risk, resistant hypertension and dyslipidemia. Patients were randomly assigned to either the home and clinic BP group or usual care group and were followed for 6 months. The average BPs for each group were compared and used to titrate the study drug appropriately. Both groups achieved significant declines in BP, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (P<.0001). These findings demonstrate that BP control could be achieved at a rate of 43.5% compared with the 2004 national control rate of 35%. The LDL control rate was also improved. Cardiovascular risk reduction has been proven to be achieved through managing lipids and BP. This trial demonstrates that these goals can be achieved similar to other groups in indigent African Americans with high-risk hypertension and dyslipidemia.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - The "10 keys" to healthy aging: 24-month follow-up results from an innovative community-based prevention program.
AB  - The purpose of this report was to evaluate a prevention program to reduce risk factors for common diseases among older individuals in a lower income community. This randomized community-based study enrolled older adults into a Brief Education and Counseling Intervention or a Brief Education and Counseling Intervention plus a physical activity and (for those with hypertension) a dietary sodium intervention. Outcomes were collected on 389 adults with a mean age of 73.9 years over 24 months. Adherence to the "10 Keys" improved significantly in the proportion meeting goals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+14%), bone mineral density testing (+11%), pneumonia vaccination (+11%), colonoscopy (+14%), and adherence to antihypertensive medication (+9%). This program resulted in significant reductions in key risk factors, increases in immunizations, and adherence to established prevention guidelines over 2 years. Further research is needed to refine the use of community health counselors for translating prevention knowledge into community settings. A major limitation of these studies is the low participation percentage.

TI  - Switching therapy from variable-dose multiple pill to fixed-dose single-pill combinations of angiotensin II receptor blockers and thiazides for hypertension.
AB  - The efficacy and tolerability of switching therapy from free combinations of angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and thiazide (A/T) to a fixed-dose of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide (L/H) has not been evaluated in Japan. We examined effects of switching therapy from variable-dose multiple-pill A/T to a fixed-dose L/H on blood pressure (BP) along with medication adherence and the degree of satisfaction in 91 hypertensive outpatients (mean age, 65.2 +/- 9.6 years). After 6 months, a significant BP reduction (132 +/- 9/76 +/- 10 vs. 126 +/- 12/72 +/- 11 mm Hg), along with an improvement of attaining target BP (44.0 vs. 61.5%) and that of adherence, were observed. The magnitude of BP reduction in the participants increased their degree of satisfaction more significantly than in the participants who worsened their degree of satisfaction. The estimated glomerular filtration rate and the serum uric acid (UA) level decreased slightly but significantly. The hemoglobin A1c of participants with diabetes mellitus increased slightly but significantly. In conclusion, a switch in therapy from variable-dose, multiple-pill A/T combinations to a fixed-dose, single-pill L/H was effective in decreasing BP and serum UA in Japanese clinical practice. Metabolic side effects of L/H in patients with diabetes mellitus remain to be investigated.

TI  - Optimal recall period in assessing the adherence to antihypertensive therapy: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of patient self-reported adherence, and to find the optimal length of recall period which best reflects the long-term adherence pattern of the patient.
AB  - SETTING: Patients were recruited from a general practitioner's practice in a Hungarian town.
AB  - METHOD: In this prospective study 30 patients, who had already been on antihypertensive treatment, were involved. The study was designed to monitor one antihypertensive medication per patient for 3 months. Patients received a 3-month supply of one antihypertensive medication in an electronic Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). At the end of the study period patients completed a structured questionnaire regarding their medication taking behavior during the last 7, 14 and 30 days. The results measured with MEMS were considered as the reference value, and other measures were compared using the Bland-Altman method.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported adherence, length of recall period, taking adherence and timing adherence measured by MEMS.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 30 patients included, 29 patients (13 males and 16 females) completed the study. The mean age of the patients was 60.6 years, ranging between 36 and 86 years. Patients were monitored for an average of 89 days (ranging between 49 and 106 days). Fifteen patients were on once daily, 9 patients were on twice daily, and 5 patients were on 3 times daily dosing schedule. The total expected number of medication taking events was 4,281. The MEMS caps recorded a total of 4,071 openings, which showed only a 3.56% deviation from the pill counts of the remaining tablets. The overall taking adherence was 95.1%, timing adherence was 75.2%. Patients' adherence report using a visual analog scale and reporting the number of missed doses became more accurate as the length of the recall period increased. Increased number of chronically taken medications was associated with better adherence. Increased dosing frequency of the observed antihypertensive medication resulted in decreased adherence.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The results showed that the length of the recall period influences the accuracy of self-reported adherence. Patients seem to be able to report more precisely their medication taking behavior regarding a 30 day period than a 7 day period.

TI  - Effect of a 36-month pharmaceutical care program on pharmacotherapy adherence in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a pharmaceutical care program on pharmacotherapy adherence in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients. The clinical outcomes of this pharmacotherapy adherence approach were the secondary objective of the study.
AB  - SETTING: Public Primary Health Care Unit in a municipality in the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo.
AB  - METHOD: A 36-month randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial was carried out with 200 patients divided into two groups: control (n = 100) and intervention (n = 100). The control group received the usual care offered by the Primary Health Care Unit (medical and nurse consultancies). The patients randomized into the intervention group received pharmaceutical care intervention besides the usual care offered.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Pharmacotherapy adherence (Morisky-Green test translated into Portuguese and computerized dispensed medication history) and clinical measurements (blood pressure, fasting glucose, A1C hemoglobin, triglycerides and total cholesterol) were evaluated at the baseline and up to 36 months. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 97 patients from the intervention group and 97 patients from the control group completed the study (n = 194). Significant improvements in the pharmacotherapy adherence were verified for the intervention group according to the Morisky-Green test (50.5% of adherent patients at baseline vs. 83.5% of adherent patients after 36 months; P < 0.001) and the computerized dispensed medication history (52.6% of adherent patients at baseline vs. 83.5% of adherent patients after 36 months; P < 0.001); no significant changes were verified in the control group. Significant improvements in the number of patients reaching adequate values for their blood pressure (26.8% at baseline vs. 86.6% after 36-months; P < 0.001), fasting glucose (29.9% at baseline vs. 70.1% after 36 months; P < 0.001), A1C hemoglobin (3.3% at baseline vs. 63.3% after 36 months; P < 0.001), triglycerides (47.4% at baseline vs. 74.2% after 36 months; P < 0.001) and total cholesterol (59.8% at baseline vs. 80.4% after 36 months; P = 0.002) were verified in the intervention group, but remained unchanged in the control group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: These results indicated the effectiveness of pharmaceutical care in improving pharmacotherapy adherence, with positive effects in the clinical outcomes of the patients studied.

TI  - Low medication adherence and the incidence of stroke symptoms among individuals with hypertension: the REGARDS study.
AB  - The authors analyzed data on 9950 participants taking antihypertensive medications in the nationwide Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study to determine the association between medication adherence and incident stroke symptoms. Medication adherence was assessed using a validated 4-item self-report scale and participants were categorized into 4 groups (scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 or 4, with higher scores indicating worse adherence). The incidence of 6 stroke symptoms (sudden weakness on one side of the body, numbness, painless loss of vision in one or both eyes, loss of half vision, losing the ability to understand people, and losing the ability to express oneself verbally or in writing) was assessed via telephone interviews every 6 months. During a median of 4 years, the incidence of any stroke symptom was 14.6%, 17.9%, 20.2%, and 24.9% among participants with adherence scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 or 4, respectively (P<.001). The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for any stroke symptom associated with adherence scores of 1, 2, and 3 or 4, vs 0, was 1.20 (1.04-1.39), 1.23 (0.94-1.60), and 1.59 (1.08-2.33), respectively (P<.001). Worse adherence was also associated with higher multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for each of the 6 stroke symptoms.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - A multimodal blood pressure control intervention in 3 healthcare systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a multimodal intervention composed of patient education, home blood pressure (BP) monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an interactive voice response (IVR) phone system, and clinical pharmacist follow-up improves BP control compared with usual care.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study with patient enrollment, medication consultation and adjustment, remote BP monitoring, and follow-up at 6 months.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at 3 healthcare systems in Denver, Colorado, including a large health maintenance organization, a Veterans Affairs medical center, and a county hospital. At each site, patients with uncontrolled BP were randomized to the multimodal intervention vs usual care for 6 months, with the primary end point of BP reduction.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 338 patients randomized, 283 (84%) completed the study, including 138 intervention patients and 145 usual care patients. Baseline BP was higher in the intervention group vs the usual care group (150.5/89.4 vs 143.8/85.3 mm Hg). At 6 months, BPs were similar in the intervention group vs the usual care group (137.4 vs 136.7 mm Hg, P = .85 for systolic; 82.9 vs 81.1 mm Hg, P = .14 for diastolic). However, BP reductions were greater in the intervention group vs the usual care group (-13.1 vs -7.1 mm Hg, P = .006 for systolic; -6.5 vs -4.2 mm Hg, P = .07 for diastolic). Adherence to medications was similar between the 2 groups, but intervention patients had a greater increase in medication regimen intensity.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal intervention of patient education, home BP monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an IVR system, and clinical pharmacist follow-up achieved greater reductions in BP compared with usual care.

TI  - Double effect, all over again: the case of Sister Margaret McBride.
AB  - As media reports have made widely known, in November 2009, the ethics committee of St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, permitted the abortion of an eleven-week-old fetus in order to save the life of its mother. This woman was suffering from acute pulmonary hypertension, which her doctors judged would prove fatal for both her and her previable child. The ethics committee believed abortion to be permitted in this case under the so-called principle of double effect, but Thomas J. Olmsted, the bishop of Phoenix, disagreed with the committee and pronounced its chair, Sister Margaret McBride, excommunicated latae sententiae, "by the very commission of the act." In this article, I take the much discussed Phoenix case as an occasion to subject the principle of double effect to another round of philosophical scrutiny. In particular, I examine the third condition of the principle in its textbook formulation, namely, that the evil effect in question may not be the means to the good effect. My argument, in brief, is that the textbook formulation of the principle does not withstand philosophical scrutiny. Nevertheless, in the end, I do not claim that we should then "do away" with the principle altogether. Instead, we do well to understand it within the context of casuistry, the tradition of moral reasoning from which it issued.

TI  - Effect of a 36-month pharmaceutical care program on the coronary heart disease risk in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the effect of a pharmaceutical care program on the coronary heart disease risk in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 200 elderly (> 60 years) diabetic and/or hypertensive patients were recruited into a randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial with a 36-month follow-up, developed in a public primary health care unit in a municipality in the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo. A range of clinical measurements were evaluated at the baseline and up to 36 months afterwards. The intervention group patients received pharmaceutical care from a clinical pharmacist, whereas the control group patients received their usual care from the medical and nursing staff. The Framingham scoring method was used to estimate changes in the 10-year coronary heart disease risk scores of all the patients.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 194 patients completed the study. Significant reductions (p < 0.05) in the mean values (baseline vs. 36 months) for the systolic blood pressure [156.7 mmHg vs 133.7 mmHg; P < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (106.6 mmHg vs. 91.6 mmHg; P < 0.001),fasting glucose (135.1 mg/dL vs. 107.9 mg/dL; P < 0.001), hemoglobin A1C (7.7% vs. 7.0%; P <0.001), triglycerides (206.0 mg/dL vs. 152.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)cholesterol (112.4 mg/dL vs. 102.0 mg/dL; P < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (55.5 mg/dL vs. 65.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001), total cholesterol (202.5 mg/dL vs. 185.9 mg/dL; P < 0.001), body mass index (26.2 kg/m2 vs. 26.1 kg/m2; P < 0.001), and abdominal circumference (103.2 cm vs. 102.5 cm; P= 0.001) were observed in the intervention group, whereas no significant changes were verified in the control group. The mean Framingham risk prediction score in the intervention group was 6.8% at baseline and decreased to 4.5%; P < 0.001) after 36 months, but remained unchanged in the control group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The pharmaceutical care program resulted in better clinical measurements and reduced the cardiovascular risk scores in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients over a 36-month period.

TI  - Medication adherence among rural, low-income hypertensive adults: a randomized trial of a multimedia community-based intervention.
AB  - PURPOSE: Examine the effectiveness of a community-based, multimedia intervention on medication adherence among hypertensive adults.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Rural south Alabama.
AB  - SUBJECTS: Low-income adults (N  =  434) receiving medication at no charge from a public health department or a Federally Qualified Health Center.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Both interventions were home-based and delivered via computer by a community health advisor. The adherence promotion (AP) intervention focused on theoretical variables related to adherence (e.g., barriers, decisional balance, and role models). The cancer control condition received general cancer information.
AB  - MEASURES: Adherence was assessed by pill count. Other adherence-related variables, including barriers, self-efficacy, depression, and sociodemographic variables, were collected via a telephone survey.
AB  - ANALYSIS: Chi-square analysis tested the hypothesis that a greater proportion of participants in the AP intervention are >80% adherent compared to the control group. General linear modeling examined adherence as a continuous variable.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants receiving the intervention did not differ from individuals in the control group (51% vs. 49% adherent, respectively; p  =  .67). Clinic type predicted adherence (p < .0001), as did forgetting to take medications (p  =  .01) and difficulty getting to the clinic to obtain medications (p < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel interventions that focus on individual behavior and community-level targets (e.g., how health care is accessed and delivered) may be needed to improve medication adherence among low-income rural residents.

TI  - Sustained blood pressure control following discontinuation of a pharmacist intervention.
AB  - Team-based care can improve hypertension control. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate blood pressure (BP) control 18 months following the discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention. This was a retrospective analysis of patients who had previously participated in a prospective, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial. Six community-based family medicine offices were randomized to control or intervention groups. Research nurses measured BPs using an automated device during the prospective trial. The research nurses then abstracted data from medical records, including BPs, medications, changes in therapy, and laboratory values for 18 months following the discontinuation of the 6-month prospective trial. The study included 228 patients in the control (n = 146) or intervention (n = 82) groups. The control group contained more patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (P < .013), were older (P = .047), and had more coexisting conditions (P < .001) than the intervention group. Systolic BP 9 months following discontinuation of the physician-pharmacist intervention was 137.2 +/- 18.2 mm Hg and 129.8 +/- 13.3 mm Hg in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = .0015). BP control was maintained in 61 (41.8%) control patients and 55 (67.1%) intervention patients (P = .0003). At 18 months post-intervention, systolic BP was 138.1 +/- 20.4 mm Hg and 130.0 +/- 16.0 mm Hg in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = .023). BP control was maintained in 53 (36.3%) control patients and 55 (67.1%) intervention patients at 18 months post-intervention (P < .0001). A sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the uneven distribution of patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, and the differences between groups were still significant. BP control rates remained significantly higher following a physician-pharmacist intervention compared with usual care for 18 months after discontinuation of the intervention. This model has the potential value as a useful long-term strategy to benefit patients with hypertension.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Effects of daily adherence to antihypertensive medication on blood pressure control.
AB  - Clinicians are often uncertain about how to manage elevated blood pressure (BP) when a patient reports that he/she has recently missed several doses of antihypertensive medications. While we know that better adherence can improve BP during several months, the magnitude of this relationship in the short term is poorly understood. The authors examined this issue using a group of patients who monitored adherence using a Medication Events Monitoring System (MEMS) cap and had BP measurements in the course of routine clinical practice. BP readings were compared following 7 days of excellent adherence (100%) or poor adherence (< 60%), omitting BP values following intermediate adherence. Using several different methods, BP following 7 days of excellent adherence was between 12/7 mm Hg and 15/8 mm Hg lower than after 7 days of poor adherence. Clinicians can use this effect size to calibrate their impressions of what the BP might have been with improved adherence.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Use of a DASH food group score to predict excess weight gain in adolescent girls in the National Growth and Health Study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of selected dietary patterns, particularly a DASH (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension) eating pattern, on body mass index (BMI) throughout adolescence.
AB  - DESIGN: Prospective National Growth and Health Study.
AB  - SETTING: Washington, DC; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Berkeley, California.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2327 girls with 10 annual visits starting at age 9 years.
AB  - MAIN EXPOSURES: Individual DASH-related food groups and a modified DASH adherence score.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The BMI value from measured yearly height and weight over 10 years.
AB  - RESULTS: Longitudinal mixed modeling methods were used to assess the effects of individual DASH food groups and a DASH adherence score on BMI during 10 years of follow-up, adjusting for race, height, socioeconomic status, television viewing and video game playing hours, physical activity level, and total energy intake. Girls in the highest vs lowest quintile of the DASH score had an adjusted mean BMI of 24.4 vs 26.3 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) (P < .05). The strongest individual food group predictors of BMI were total fruit (mean BMI, 26.0 vs 23.6 for <1 vs >2 servings per day; P < .001) and low-fat dairy (mean BMI, 25.7 vs 23.2 for <1 vs >2 servings per day; P < .001). Whole grain consumption was more weakly but beneficially associated with BMI.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent girls whose diet more closely resembled the DASH eating pattern had smaller gains in BMI over 10 years. Such an eating pattern may help prevent excess weight gain during adolescence.

TI  - Adherence with brimonidine in patients with glaucoma aware and not aware of electronic monitoring.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the impact of open versus masked adherence monitoring on adherence with topical brimonidine using two different dosing schedules.
AB  - METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled in a prospective, observational cohort study. Patients were randomly assigned to open or masked adherence monitoring and to brimonidine twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID). Patients received conventional brimonidine eye drops with attached electronic monitoring devices for 4 weeks with weekly intraocular pressure measurements. Adherence calculations comprised dosing intervals, adherence rate and time covered. Subgroup analysis with anova included the factors masking, regimen, diagnosis and age.
AB  - RESULTS: Among 36 individually analysed patients, 12 (33%) had adherence rates above 75%, therein two (5%)>90%. The mean adherence rate in 19 patients aware of adherence measurements was 70 +/- 17% for brimonidine BID and 65 +/- 14% for TID, not significantly different to the rates of 17 patients not informed about adherence measurements (77 +/- 6% BID, 62 +/- 9% TID, p = 0.24). On average, patients with brimonidine TID achieved significantly lower adherence rates (64 +/- 12%) than patients on BID (73 +/- 13%, p = 0.02). Still, patients on TID applied brimonidine more often (TID 1.9 +/- 0.3, BID 1.5 +/- 0.1 mean applications per day). The median coverage was 70% and showed no statistically significant difference between patients on BID and TID (p = 0.36).
AB  - CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest that adherence measurements are not significantly altered by open adherence monitoring, which may simplify future adherence studies. Adherence with brimonidine eye drops was insufficient for most patients. These results demonstrate the necessity to develop new strategies to improve compliance in glaucoma therapy.Copyright © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a nurse-managed home telehealth intervention to improve outcomes in veterans with comorbid diabetes and HTN.
AB  - DESIGN: A single-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial design comparing two remote monitoring intensity levels and usual care in patients with type 2 diabetes and HTN being treated in primary care was used.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were hemoglobin A1c and systolic blood pressure (SBP); secondary outcome was adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Intervention subjects experienced decreased A1c during the 6-month intervention period compared with the control group, but 6 months after the intervention was withdrawn, the intervention groups were comparable with the control group. For SBP, the high-intensity subjects had a significant decrease in SBP compared with the other groups at 6 months and this pattern was maintained at 12 months. Adherence improved over time for all groups, but there were no differences among the three groups.
AB  - LIMITATIONS: Subjects had relatively good baseline control for A1c and SBP; minorities and women were underrepresented.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Home telehealth provides an innovative and pragmatic approach to enhance earlier detection of key clinical symptoms requiring intervention. Transmission of education and advice to the patient on an ongoing basis with close surveillance by nurses can improve clinical outcomes in patients with comorbid chronic illness.

TI  - Limitations of analyses based on achieved blood pressure: lessons from the African American study of kidney disease and hypertension trial.
AB  - Blood pressure (BP) guidelines that set target BP levels often rely on analyses of achieved BP from hypertension treatment trials. The objective of this article was to compare the results of analyses of achieved BP to intention-to-treat analyses on renal disease progression. Participants (n=1094) in the African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Trial were randomly assigned to either usual BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of 102 to 107 mm Hg or lower BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of <92 mm Hg. Median follow-up was 3.7 years. Primary outcomes were rate of decline in measured glomerular filtration rate and a composite of a decrease in glomerular filtration rate by >50% or >25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), requirement for dialysis, transplantation, or death. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no evidence of a BP effect on either the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate or the clinical composite outcome. In contrast, the achieved BP analyses showed that each 10-mm Hg increment in mean follow-up achieved mean arterial pressure was associated with a 0.35 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.62 mL/min per 1.73 m(2); P=0.01) faster mean glomerular filtration rate decline and a 17% (95% CI: 5% to 32%; P=0.006) increased risk of the clinical composite outcome. Analyses based on achieved BP lead to markedly different inferences than traditional intention-to-treat analyses, attributed in part to confounding of achieved BP with comorbidities, disease severity, and adherence. Clinicians and policy makers should exercise caution when making treatment recommendations based on analyses relating outcomes to achieved BP.

TI  - Impact of comorbidity type on measures of quality for diabetes care.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies provide conflicting results about the impact of comorbid conditions on the quality of chronic illness care. We assessed the effect of comorbidity type (concordant, discordant, or both) on the receipt of guideline-recommended care among patients with diabetes.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN: Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 condition groups: diabetes-concordant (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, hyperlipidemia), and/or diabetes-discordant (arthritis, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) conditions, or neither. We evaluated hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol readings at index and measured overall good quality of diabetes care, including a 6-month follow-up interval. We assessed the effect of condition group on overall good quality of care with logistic regression and generalized ordered logistic regression.
AB  - RESULTS: We assigned 35,872 patients to the diabetes comorbid condition groups, ranging from 2.0% in the discordant-only group to 58.0% in the concordant-only group. Patients with both types of conditions were more likely than those with no comorbidities to receive overall good quality for glycemic [odds ratio (OR), 2.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.86-2.41], blood pressure (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.40-1.84), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 3.08-4.05) control within 6 months of an index visit. They were also more likely to receive overall good quality for all 3 quality measures combined (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.96-2.39).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the greatest clinical complexity were more likely than less complex patients to receive high quality diabetes care, suggesting that increased complexity does not necessarily predispose chronically ill patients to receiving poorer care. However, caution should be used in treating certain patient groups, such as the elderly, for whom adherence to multiple condition-specific guidelines may lack benefit or cause harm.

TI  - High sodium intake of children through 'hidden' food sources and its association with the Mediterranean diet: the GRECO study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sodium is the mineral that has been, mainly, linked to hypertension and cardiovascular disease. It is found naturally in many foods, but is also used in the food industry and manufacturing. Identification of total sodium intake, as well as 'hidden' sodium intake from food sources early in life is necessary.
AB  - METHODS: Four thousand, five hundred and eighty children aged 10-12 years were enrolled, in a cross-sectional, population-based survey. Among other measurements, dietary data were obtained by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and sodium intake was calculated. High sodium consumption was considered an intake over 2200 mg/day. Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was evaluated using the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for children and adolescent score (KIDMED score).
AB  - RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of Greek children had sodium intake which exceeded the 2200 mg/day recommendation, excluding salt added at table and during cooking. Sodium intake was found elevated in children with moderate and high adherence to the Mediterranean Diet. Additionally, 1 unit increase in KIDMED score (i.e. higher adherence) was associated with 10% [odds ratio (OR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.13] increased likelihood of consuming sodium above the median intake (i.e. >1500 mg/day). Thirty-four percent of sodium intake from 'hidden' sources came from bread, processed cereals and white cheese.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Greek children have an elevated sodium intake from 'hidden' sources and main contributors are foods which are recommended to be consumed on a daily basis according to the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid. These findings should induce manufacturers to reduce the amount of sodium added during processing of 'healthy' foods, especially bread and cheese.

TI  - Development of new concepts of non-adherence measurements among users of antihypertensives medicines.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various types of non-adherence among users of antihypertensive medications by establishing components of adherence measures and use these components for measuring the prevalence of non-adherence.
AB  - SETTING: Twelve community pharmacies from the Danish county of Funen.
AB  - METHOD: Users of antihypertensive medication were included in the study. 2,914 medication users received questionnaires by mail. Participating patients were asked to fill in two questionnaire regarding demographics, self-reported blood pressure, and various adherence measures. Two factor analyses were conducted based on responses to questions.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medication-taking behaviour and self-efficacy (beliefs about ability and capacity to accomplish a task), respectively. Other measures of non-adherence collected by questionnaire were also addressed in the data for comparison of prevalence with the developed concepts.
AB  - RESULTS: 1,426 (49%) participants answered the questionnaires. The analyses resulted in two sets of components: three adherence behaviour measures and two self-efficacy measures which showed similarities in concepts. The adherence behaviour measures included two concepts of intentional nonadherence (associated with aspects of self-regulation and effect concerns, respectively) and one measure of non-intentional non-adherence. Prevalence of the developed measures of behaviour related non-adherence ranged from 10.3 to 34.9% depending on which type of non-adherence measure was used. Established measures of non-adherence resulted in prevalence between 2.2 and 39.6%.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that concepts of non-adherence measurements could be determined including self-efficacy aspects, unintentional non-adherence and intentional non-adherence related to self-regulation and effect concerns respectively. The prevalence of the adherence behaviour components were found to be between 10.3 and 34.9%, which is in the range of expected values. Associations between the new concepts of non-adherence measurement and characteristics of nonadherers remain to be established and would be a subject for further studies.

TI  - Continuity of care and its effect on prescription drug use among Medicare beneficiaries with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuity of care is one of the pillars of primary care; yet, it is unclear whether having a regular physician influences the use of prescription drugs among the elderly.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of continuity of care on prescription drug use for Medicare beneficiaries with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Medicare beneficiaries age 67 years and older were categorized in 3 groups according to the level of continuity of care experienced during the year preceding an initial diagnosis of hypertension. The group with the lowest level (poor continuity) was selected as control, and matched on previous use of health services, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, using propensity scores, to the intermediate and high continuity groups. Fixed effect models examined the association of continuity of care to number of drugs classes, cost of drugs, use of thiazide diuretics, and adherence to treatment.
AB  - RESULTS: There was no clear evidence that Medicare beneficiaries with greater continuity of care had increased adherence to antihypertensive drugs for most variables studied. The only major difference was that total number of classes of drugs purchased was 10% higher for the intermediate group, and 15% higher for the high Continuity of Care index group compared with the control group (P<0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: A prior history of continuity of care may lead to purchasing more drugs overall but may not increase adherence to hypertension treatment among the elderly.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a patient centered cardiovascular health education program for insured patients in rural Nigeria (QUICK - II).
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Sub Saharan Africa, the incidence of hypertension and other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors is growing rapidly. Poor adherence to prescribed prevention and treatment regimens by patients can compromise treatment outcomes. Patient-centered cardiovascular health education is likely to improve shortcomings in adherence. This paper describes a study that aims to develop a cardiovascular health education program for patients participating in a subsidized insurance plan in Nigeria and to evaluate the applicability and effectiveness in patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN:
AB  - DESIGN: The study has two parts. Part 1 will develop a cardiovascular health education program, using qualitative interviews with stakeholders. Part 2 will evaluate the effectiveness of the program in patients, using a prospective (pre-post) observational design.
AB  - SETTING: A rural primary health center in Kwara State, Nigeria.
AB  - POPULATION: For part 1: 40 patients, 10 healthcare professionals, and 5 insurance managers. For part 2: 150 patients with uncontrolled hypertension or other cardiovascular risk factors after one year of treatment.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Part 2: patient-centered cardiovascular health education program.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Part 1: Semi-structured interviews to identify stakeholder perspectives. Part 2: Pre- and post-intervention assessments including patients' demographic and socioeconomic data, blood pressure, body mass index and self-reporting measures on medication adherence and perception of care. Feasibility of the intervention will be measured using process data.
AB  - OUTCOMES: For program development (part 1): overview of healthcare professionals' perceptions on barriers and facilitators to care, protocol for patient education, and protocol implementation plan.For program evaluation (part 2): changes in patients' scores on adherence to medication and life style changes, blood pressure, and other physiological and self-reporting measures at six months past baseline.
AB  - ANALYSIS: Part 1: content analytic technique utilizing MAXQDA software. Part 2: univariate and multilevel analysis to assess outcomes of intervention.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Diligent implementation of patient-centered education should enhance adherence to cardiovascular disease prevention and management programs in low income countries.

TI  - Secondary prevention risk interventions via telemedicine and tailored patient education (SPRITE): a randomized trial to improve postmyocardial infarction management.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary prevention by risk factor modification improves patient outcomes, yet it is often not achieved in clinical practice. Reasons for failure stem from challenges of prioritizing risk factor reduction and engaging patients in changing their behaviors. We hypothesize that a novel telemedicine intervention with tailored patient education could improve cardiovascular risk factors.
AB  - METHODS: To evaluate this intervention, we propose enrolling 450 patients with a recent myocardial infarction and hypertension into a 3-arm randomized, controlled trial. The first arm (n=150) will receive home blood pressure (BP) monitors plus a nurse-delivered, telephone-based tailored patient education intervention and will be enrolled into HealthVault, a Microsoft electronic health record platform. The second arm (n=150) will also receive BP monitors plus a tailored patient education intervention and be enrolled in HeartVault. However, the patient education intervention will be delivered by a Web-based program and will cover topics identical to those in the nurse-delivered intervention. Both arms will be compared with a control group receiving standard care (n=150). All participants will have an in-person assessment at baseline and at completion of the study, including standardized measurements of BP, LDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin (in diabetic subjects). The study design will allow assessment of a telephone-based, nurse-administered disease management program versus standard care. The main outcome of interest is the reduction in systolic BP in each intervention group compared with the control group at 12 months. Secondary outcomes assessed will include reductions in LDL cholesterol, body weight, and glycosylated hemoglobin, as well as adherence to evidence-based therapies and improvement in health behaviors.
AB  - CONCLUSION: If successful in optimizing BP control, managing other coronary heart disease risk factors, and demonstrating a lower cost, the Web-based disease management tool has the potential to enhance coronary artery disease management, quality of care, and ultimately, patient outcomes.

TI  - Randomized, controlled trial of an intervention to enable stroke survivors throughout the Los Angeles County safety net to "stay with the guidelines".
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. Inpatient programs optimize secondary stroke prevention care at the time of hospital discharge, but such care may not be continued after hospital discharge.
AB  - METHODS: To improve the delivery of secondary stroke preventive services after hospital discharge, we have designed a chronic care model-based program called SUSTAIN (Systemic Use of STroke Averting INterventions). This care intervention includes group clinics, self-management support, report cards, decision support through care guides and protocols, and coordination of ongoing care. The first specific aim is to test, in a randomized, controlled trial, whether SUSTAIN improves blood pressure control among an analytic sample of 268 patients with a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack discharged from 4 Los Angeles County public hospitals. Secondary outcomes consist of control of other stroke risk factors, lifestyle habits, medication adherence, patient perceptions of care quality, functional status, and quality of life. A second specific aim is to conduct a cost analysis of SUSTAIN from the perspective of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services by using direct costs of the intervention, cost equivalents of associated utilization of county system resources, and cost equivalents of the observed and predicted averted vascular events.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: If SUSTAIN is effective, we will have the expertise and findings to advocate for its continued support at Los Angeles County hospitals and to disseminate the SUSTAIN program to other settings serving indigent, minority populations.

TI  - Knowledge and adherence to antihypertensive therapy in primary care: results of a randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of a healthcare education program for patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, cluster-randomized trial was conducted. Randomization was by primary care center; 18 of 36 urban primary care centers in Barcelona and its metropolitan area were randomized to the intervention group (IG) and 18 to the control group (CG). The study sample consisted of patients with hypertension (n=996; 515 in the IG and 481 in the CG) receiving outpatient treatment with antihypertensive drugs. The intervention consisted of personalized information by a trained nurse and written leaflets. Questionnaires on knowledge and awareness of hypertension and its medication, treatment adherence, healthy lifestyle habits, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index were assessed at each visit, with a 12-month follow-up. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied.
AB  - RESULTS: Knowledge of hypertension increased by 27.8% in the IG and by 18.5% in the CG, while that of medication increased by 10.1% in the IG and 5.5% in the CG. Treatment adherence measured by the Morisky-Green test increased by 9.6% (95% CI: 5.5-13.6) in the IG and 8.8% (95% CI: 4.9-12.6) in the CG. There were no differences in adherence on the other tests used. No differences were observed between the IG and CG in clinical variables such as blood pressure or BMI at the end of the trial.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The educational intervention had no significant impact on patients' adherence to the medication.Copyright © 2010 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pharmacist intervention program to enhance hypertension control: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies have demonstrated that hypertension remains inadequately managed throughout the world, with lack of adherence to BP-lowering medication being a major factor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if a pharmaceutical care program could improve antihypertensive medication adherence and blood pressure control.
AB  - SETTING: This study was conducted in a secondary care hypertension/dyslipidemia outpatient clinic in the university teaching hospital of Cova da Beira Hospital Centre, Covilha, located in the Eastern Central Region of Portugal.
AB  - METHOD: This report evaluates the pharmacist's interventions during a prospective randomised controlled trial, from July 2009 to June 2010. Patients with diagnosis of essential hypertension attending the clinic for routine follow-up were randomly allocated either to a control group (no pharmaceutical care) or to an intervention group (quarterly follow-up by a hospital pharmacist during a 9-month period). The pharmacist interventions, aimed to increase medication adherence and blood pressure control, involved educational interventions and counselling tips directed to the patient.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and blood pressure control (according to JNC 7 guidelines) assessed at the baseline visit and at the end of pharmaceutical care were the main outcome measures. Blood pressure measurements were performed by blinded nurses. Medication adherence was also evaluated, using a validated questionnaire at baseline and at the end of investigation. Results A total of 197 hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to the study (99 in the control group and 98 in the intervention group). Although there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in both groups concerning mean age, gender, body mass index, and antihypertensive pharmacotherapy, blood pressure control was higher in the intervention group (P = 0.005) at the end of the study. Significant lower systolic blood pressure (-6.8 mmHg, P = 0.006) and diastolic blood pressure (-2.9 mmHg, P = 0.020) levels were observed in the intervention group. Medication adherence was also significantly higher in the intervention group at the end of the study (74.5% vs. 57.6%, P = 0.012).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Pharmacist intervention can significantly improve medication adherence and blood pressure control in patients treated with antihypertensive agents.

TI  - Antihypertensive medication versus health promotion for improving metabolic syndrome in preventing cardiovascular events: a success rate-oriented simulation study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In practice, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of traditional antihypertensive treatment with that of health promotion in reducing incidence rate of cardiovascular disease (IRCVD, events/year). This simulation study compared the effectiveness of two approaches to reducing IRCVD in a sample population: a traditional approach, in which high-risk patients are treated with conventional antihypertensive medications, and a population-based approach, in which subjects participate in a health promotion program.
AB  - METHODS: We constructed a simulation model for a sample population of middle-aged Japanese men whose systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels are normally distributed (130 +/- 20 mm Hg). The principal assumption was that IRCVD increases exponentially according to SBP. The population IRCVD was calculated as the product of the distribution of SBP multiplied by IRCVD at each SBP. The cumulative IRCVD was calculated by the definite integral from the lowest to the highest SBP of IRCVD at each SBP level. The success rates were calculated according to SBP and metabolic risk profiles in the two approaches, respectively.
AB  - RESULTS: The reduction in IRCVD was twice as large for antihypertensive medications as it was for health promotion in several situations. For example, if adherence to antihypertensive treatment occurred at a realistic level, the decrease in IRCVD was estimated at 9.99 x 10(-4). In contrast, even if the health program was promoted optimistically, the decrease in IRCVD was estimated at 4.69 x 10(-4).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The success rate-oriented simulation suggests that prescribing antihypertensive medications is superior to promoting the health promotion program in reducing IRCVD in virtual middle-aged Japanese men.

TI  - Augmented antihypertensive effect of a fixed combination formula of candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide combined with furosemide in a patient on peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - A 38-year-old female patient on peritoneal dialysis (PD) due to type 1 diabetic nephropathy with a well-preserved residual renal function did not respond well to the conventional antihypertensive therapy consisting of candesartan, furosemide, and bunazosin. Switching candesartan for a fixed combination formula of candesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) while the rest of the other two agents remained unchanged led to the remarkable reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) without significant changes in the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), body weight (BW), and residual renal function. This case suggests that when used in combination, diuretics acting on different functional segment of the nephron hold greater potential for enhanced antihypertensive effect, especially in patients on PD whose residual renal function is well preserved. A small dose of HCTZ with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) may partially explain the therapeutic benefit of this combination therapy in terms of a reliable hypotensive effect, a better adherence, and fewer side effects.

TI  - The effect of patient education and home monitoring on medication compliance, hypertension management, healthy lifestyle behaviours and BMI in a primary health care setting.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of anti-hypertensive patient-oriented education and in-home monitoring for medication adherence and management of hypertension in a primary care setting, by providing education on healthy lifestyle behaviours and medication adherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is the third most common cause of death worldwide. Prevalence of hypertension in Turkey is approximately 30% in the general population and 45-50% in population over 50.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomised controlled study.
AB  - METHODS: This study conducted in Turkey used a study group comprised of 120 subjects (40 Group A, 40 Group B, 40 controls), all previously diagnosed with hypertension and who started medication therapy at least one year prior to start of study. The study was conducted between February-November 2006 at public primary health care facilities and homes of the study participants. Participants in Group A and B received a total of six monthly education sessions, four times during clinic visits and two home visits. Medication adherence education for Groups A and B and education about healthy lifestyle behaviours for Group B were administered in a structured and individualised format. The control group was routinely monitored in health care facilities.
AB  - RESULTS: Healthy lifestyle behaviours and perception of self-efficacy regarding medication adherence showed improvement after education sessions in Groups A and B. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures of subjects in Group A and B showed a significant decrease compared with those of the control group; the blood pressure decrease in Group B was greater than in Group A.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Nurses play an important role in uncontrolled hypertension detection and can improve medication adherence and healthy lifestyle behaviours.
AB  - RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Patient education medication adherence alone and in combination with healthy lifestyle behaviour teaching is an effective tool for blood pressure reduction in the hypertensive population in primary health care settings.Copyright © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Lifestyle advice for Korean Americans and native Koreans with hypertension.
AB  - AIM: This paper is a report of a comparison of advice on lifestyle given by healthcare providers and subsequent action by recipients between Korean Americans and native Koreans with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: High blood pressure is controllable by having a healthy lifestyle, such as weight control, dietary change, exercise, low-sodium diet, alcohol restriction and smoking cessation, and by taking medication. Healthcare providers play an important role in teaching individuals with hypertension on healthy lifestyles.
AB  - METHOD: This descriptive comparative study was conducted with a convenience sample of 100 Korean Americans and 100 native Koreans with hypertension. They were interviewed between May 2003 and June 2004 on the advice they received from healthcare providers on lifestyle and their subsequent action in terms of taking medication, weight control, dietary change, exercise, low-sodium diet, smoking cessation, alcohol restriction and tension reduction. Nutrient profiles were examined using the 24-hour dietary recall method.
AB  - FINDINGS: Korean Americans received advice on lifestyle less than did native Koreans, but more Korean Americans followed healthy lifestyle advice on dietary change and exercise than did native Koreans (P<0.001). Weight control was the least adhered to behaviour among the Korean Americans, although almost two-thirds of them were overweight or obese. Both groups exceeded the Dietary Reference Intakes of sodium, but perceived their sodium consumption as low.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Native Korean participants need to pay closer attention to carrying out the advice, whereas healthcare providers to Korean Americans need to give more advice on culturally acceptable healthy lifestyles, particularly on dietary changes and weight control. Both groups need to monitor their sodium intake more realistically. It is not only advice from healthcare providers that is integral to control of hypertension, but also that patients should follow that advice.Copyright © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - [Influence of compliance on the incidence of cardiovascular events and health costs when using single-pill fixed-dose combinations for the treatment of hypertension]. [Spanish]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of cardiovascular events (CVE) and health care costs in relation to compliance, persistence and level of blood pressure control when comparing patients treated with single-pill combinations (SPC) or free combinations (FC) for the treatment of hypertension.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Observational, multicenter study that included patients>30 years old, from six primary care teams and two hospitals, who started pharmacological treatment for hypertension during 2006. Two study groups were established: SPC (ACEIs/diuretics; ARBs/diuretics) and FC (ACEIs+DIU; ARB+DIU, separately). Main variables studied were sociodemographic data, comorbidity, Charlson-index, compliance, persistence and achievement of therapeutic goals (ESH-ESC criteria). The cumulative incidence of CVE and a total-cost model were determined (differentiating: health/direct; non-health/indirect). Patients were followed for two years. Statistical analysis included logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards model and analysis of covariance. Statistical signification: p<0.05.
AB  - RESULTS: 1,605 patients were recruited, 1,112 (69.3%) receiving SPC and 493 (30.7%) receiving FC, p<0.001; mean age: 69.4 (12.2) years; women: 55.5%. FC treatments were associated with ischaemic heart disease (OR=1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0) and organ failure (OR=1.5; 95% CI: 1.2-2.1), p<0.031. Patients on SPC showed better therapeutic compliance (77.6% vs 71.9%; p<0.001) and longer persistence of treatment (62.1% on-treatment at 24-months [95% CI: 56.3-67.9] vs 49.7% [95% CI: 38.5-60.9]; p<0.001). Optimal control of blood pressure was higher in SPC (48.9% [95% CI: 43.0-54.8] vs 46.7% [95% CI: 35.6-57.8]; p<0.001). Cumulative incidence of cerebrovascular accidents in FC was 4.6% vs 2.4% in SPC; p=0.041. The total health care costs were lower in SPC (1,650.7  vs 1,674.8 ; p<0.001), including lower specialized care costs (316.1  vs 382.9 ; p<0.001), fewer hospital admissions and less loss of labour productivity (44.5  vs 88.4 ; p<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Better compliance and persistence with antihypertensive fixed-dose combinations improves therapeutic control, leading to a significant reduction of cerebrovascular accidents and total health care costs.Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reducing cardiovascular disease risk in medically underserved urban and rural communities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate methods for lowering cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in asymptomatic urban and rural underserved subjects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medically underserved populations are at increased CVD risk, and systems to lower CVD risk are needed. Nurse management (NM) and telemedicine (T) systems may provide low-cost solutions for this care.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized 465 subjects without overt CVD, with Framingham CVD risk >10% to NM with 4 visits over 1 year, or NM plus T to facilitate weight, blood pressure (BP), and physical activity reporting. The study goal was to reduce CVD risk by 5%.
AB  - RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-eight subjects completed the study. Cardiovascular disease risk fell by > 5% in 32% of the NM group and 26% of the T group (P, nonsignificant). In hyperlipidemic subjects, total cholesterol decreased (NM -21.9 +/- 39.4, T -22.7 +/- 41.3 mg/dL) significantly. In subjects with grade II hypertension (systolic BP > 160 mm Hg, 24% of subjects), both NM and T groups had a similar BP response (average study BP: NM 147.4 +/- 17.5, T 145.3. +/- 18.4, P is nonsignificant), and for those with grade I hypertension (37% of subjects), T had a lower average study BP compared to NM (NM 140.4 +/- 16.9, T 134.6 +/- 15.0, P = .058). In subjects at high risk (Framingham score > 20%), risk fell 6.0% +/- 9.9%; in subjects at intermediate risk (Framingham score > 10, < 20), risk fell 1.3% +/- 4.5% (P < .001 compared to high-risk subjects). Medication adherence was similar in both high- and intermediate-risk subjects.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In 2 underserved populations, CVD risk was reduced by a nurse intervention; T did not add to the risk improvement. Reductions in BP and blood lipids occurred in both high- and intermediate-risk subjects with greatest reductions noted in the high-risk subjects. Frequent communication using a nurse intervention contributes to improved CVD risk in asymptomatic, underserved subjects with increased CVD risk. Telemedicine did not change the effectiveness of the nurse intervention.Copyright © 2011 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Clinical and economic impact of clinical pharmacy service on hyperlipidemic management in Hong Kong.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and economic outcomes of a clinical pharmacy service (CPS) in dyslipidemic management.
AB  - METHOD: This was a 24-month prospective controlled trial conducted at the lipid clinic of a public hospital in Hong Kong. In the intervention group, a clinical pharmacist assessed low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and provided recommendations in accordance to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines. Medication compliance and the proper use of drugs were assessed. Education on healthy lifestyles was reinforced. Monthly telephone follow-ups were made to check on the progress of patients. In the control group, patients received usual medical care with no pharmacist intervention. Primary outcome was the percentage of patients achieving the ATP III LDL-C goal at the end of study. The estimated cost of such service was also evaluated.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 300 patients were recruited into the study (150 in intervention group and 150 in control group). In the intervention group, 58.7% patients achieved LDL-C goals compared with 45.3% in the control group (P < .05). The intervention group achieved 26.4%, 17.4%, and 30.0% mean reduction in LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) levels, respectively, compared with 12.6%, 6.6%, and 11.5% in the control group (P < .05). The estimated cost for this clinical service was US$385/month for a total of 600 dyslipidemic patients seen per year.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate the positive impact CPS can have on achieving treatment goals in lipid management. Similar services for other problematic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus may also be benefited by similar CPSs.

TI  - Stroke prevention care delivery: predictors of risk factor management outcomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Internationally, the development and implementation of stroke care guidelines have resulted in the evolution of stroke prevention outpatient clinics designed to accelerate patient access to treatment and behavioral risk reduction following transient ischemic attack or stroke.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent to which selected demographic, social-psychological, physiological, and adherence characteristics predicted achievement of blood pressure and glucose targets in a group of patients referred to a Canadian stroke prevention clinic with confirmed transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke and hypertension and/or diabetes.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 313, English speaking, adult patients who were referred from family or emergency department physicians to a stroke prevention clinic provided demographic data and received social-psychological screening testing at intake. Of these, 93 participants who met criteria of confirmed TIA or stroke plus hypertension and/or diabetes were identified as the study group. Seventy-seven of study group participants completed a 6-month follow-up.
AB  - METHODS: Admission screening tests included the Modified and Mini-Mental State Examinations, Trail Making Test, Clock Drawing Test, a medication self-efficacy scale, the Lubben Social Network Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Family physician follow-up was ascertained 4-8 weeks after intake. At approximately 6 months after the initial screening measures, 77 study group participants completed additional measures of adherence, blood pressure and/or glycated hemoglobin.
AB  - RESULTS: Transient ischemic attack was confirmed in 58% and stroke in 42% of the study group. Mean age was 69 years (SD=11); 53% were male; 97% had hypertension; and 25% were diabetic; some had both. Twenty-three percent were not followed-up by family practitioners. At 6-month follow-up, 97% reported >80% adherence to medication; only 57% met treatment targets. A logistic regression analysis identified three independent predictors of achieving blood pressure and/or glucose targets: self-efficacy expectations (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.03-2.54; p=0.04), Mini-Mental State (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06-1.54; p=0.009); and self-reported adherence (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.29; p=0.03).

TI  - Dose-dependent antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of perindopril in a large, observational, 12-week, general practice-based study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend the use of full therapeutic dosages of antihypertensive agents, or combination therapy, to improve BP control of hypertensive patients in primary healthcare.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent antihypertensive efficacy and safety of perindopril 4 and 8mg/day in the clinical setting.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The CONFIDENCE study was a prospective, observational, multicenter trial. This was a real-world, clinic-based, outpatient study involving 880 general practitioners/primary-care clinics and 113 specialists in Canada.
AB  - PATIENTS: The study included untreated or inadequately managed patients with hypertension (i.e. seated BP > 140/90mmHg, or > 130/80mmHg in the presence of diabetes mellitus, renal disease, or proteinuria) without coronary artery disease (CAD).
AB  - INTERVENTION: Treatment consisted of perindopril 4mg/day, uptitrated to 8mg/day as required for BP control at visit 2, for 12 weeks. Among the patients already being treated at baseline, perindopril either directly replaced all previous ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), or was added to antihypertensive treatment with calcium channel blockers (CCBs), diuretics, or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers).
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the mean changes in BP from baseline following treatment with perindopril 4 and 8mg/day as well as the proportion of patients achieving BP control (BP <140/90mmHg, or <130/80mmHg in diabetic patients) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary analyses included the incidence of adverse events and compliance.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 8298 hypertensive patients entered the study: 56% with newly diagnosed hypertension and 44% with uncontrolled hypertension. Mean SBP/DBP decreased significantly from baseline (152.5 +/- 10.8/89.5 +/- 9mmHg) over 12 weeks (-18.5/-9.7mmHg; p<0.001). At visit 2, 23% of patients were uptitrated to perindopril 8mg/day, which resulted in an additional mean 10.1/5.3mmHg BP reduction; this reduction was even greater (15.1/5.7mmHg) among a separate group of severely hypertensive patients (i.e. SBP >170mmHg or DBP >109mmHg at baseline). Target BP was achieved in 54% of the ITT population. Both perindopril 4mg/day and perindopril 8mg/day were well tolerated and compliance was high throughout the study.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In the clinical outpatient setting, perindopril was found to be an effective dose-dependent and well tolerated antihypertensive treatment, with good compliance. Uptitration to the full therapeutic dosage of perindopril is an efficient approach for the management of a broad range of hypertensive patients without CAD.

TI  - Compliance, persistence, healthcare resource use, and treatment costs associated with aliskiren plus ARB versus ACE inhibitor plus ARB combination therapy: in US patients with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence is currently equivocal on the added benefits of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with the combination of either an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) plus an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) or aliskiren, the first-in-class direct renin inhibitor, plus an ARB.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the compliance, persistence, healthcare resource utilization, and healthcare costs associated with aliskiren plus ARB versus ACEI plus ARB combination therapies among adult patients diagnosed with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Patients (aged >18 years) initiated on either combination therapy were identified in the MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases (1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008). The ARB components considered were candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan. The ACEI components included benazepril, captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, moexipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, and trandolapril. Outcomes measured during the 6-month study period included the proportion of days covered (PDC), treatment discontinuation, healthcare resource utilization, and changes in healthcare costs (study period minus 6-month baseline values). Risk-adjusted differences in outcomes between treatments and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariate regression models, controlling for demographics, region, co-morbidities, prescription drug use, and resource utilization during the baseline period.
AB  - RESULTS: Adjusting for baseline characteristics, aliskiren plus ARB patients (n=1395) demonstrated a significantly higher PDC (67.0% vs 54.3%; difference 12.7%; 95% CI 10.6, 14.7) and a significantly lower discontinuation rate (50.4% vs 68.6%; odds ratio 0.46; 95% CI 0.40, 0.54) than ACEI plus ARB patients (n=16507). Aliskiren plus ARB patients had significantly fewer all-cause hospitalizations (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.73; 95% CI 0.61, 0.86) and significantly fewer all-cause emergency room (ER) visits (adjusted IRR 0.72; 95% CI 0.61, 0.85) than ACEI plus ARB patients. Compared with ACEI plus ARB therapy, aliskiren plus ARB therapy was associated with significantly larger increases in prescription costs by $US264 post therapy initiation (95% CI 153, 375), but with non-significantly greater reductions in total healthcare costs by -$583 (95% CI -2409, 1242).[2008 values].
AB  - CONCLUSION: In adult hypertensive patients, treatment with aliskiren plus ARB was associated with significantly better compliance/persistence and fewer hospitalizations and ER visits compared with ACEI plus ARB therapy. Reductions in total healthcare costs were non-significantly different between patients treated with aliskiren plus ARB versus ACEI plus ARB, despite the increased prescription costs associated with aliskiren plus ARB therapy.

TI  - Effect of feedback in promoting adherence to an exercise programme: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether providing participants in an exercise programme with regular feedback on their exercise progress affected their adherence to the programme regimen.
AB  - METHOD: We conducted a randomized controlled trial. Adult men and women with borderline hypertension and a body mass index > 25.0 were randomized to two intervention groups (groups A and B) and one control group (group C) and were prescribed regular aerobic exercise. During the 12-week study period, group A was provided with both feedback information on their exercise progress and a health letter, while group B was provided with the health letter only. The main outcome measure was exercise performance, per cent achievement of target exercise level (%) defined as the number of weeks during which the exercise target was reached divided by the number of weeks in the programme. Results were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 105 study subjects were randomized into three groups (A, n = 37; B, n = 37 and C, n = 31). Per cent achievement of target exercise level during the 12-week period was highest in group A (26.5%), followed by groups B (22.9%) and C (17.4%) (P = 0.36). Subjects who received regular feedback during the exercise programme tended to have higher exercise performance.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In improving adherence to exercise intervention, the provision of regular feedback to participants in an exercise programme may be an effective intervention.Copyright © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Impact of prolonged antihypertensive duration of action on predicted clinical outcomes in imperfectly adherent patients: comparison of aliskiren, irbesartan and ramipril.[Erratum appears in Int J Clin Pract. 2011 Jul;65(7):820]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients miss occasional doses of antihypertensives. The use of 'forgiving' drugs (i.e. drugs with duration of action longer than the 24-h dosing interval) may allow an adequate blood pressure (BP) reduction to be maintained despite missed doses.
AB  - AIM: To quantify the effects of adherence level and duration of action on estimated mean systolic BP (SBP) reduction and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
AB  - METHOD: For 1250 patients, we simulated 256-day dosing histories with realistically distributed drug holidays based on a study of electronically monitored dosing records. Adherence was set to the desired level by altering the proportion of doses missed. Mean office SBP-lowering effect (aliskiren 300 mg, -14.1 mmHg; irbesartan 300 mg, -13.3; ramipril 10 mg, -10.1 mmHg) and the rate of SBP increase after stopping treatment (off-rate; aliskiren, 1.0 mmHg/day; irbesartan, 3.6 mmHg/day; ramipril, 4.0 mmHg/day) were taken from the results of a randomised, double-blind trial. SBP was averaged over time and patient to estimate mean reductions in SBP and 10-year CVD risk (Framingham risk equation, baseline absolute 10-year CVD risk: 27%).
AB  - RESULTS: Predicted reductions in SBP and CVD risk with aliskiren were larger and less affected by imperfect adherence than the reductions with irbesartan or ramipril. For aliskiren, reducing adherence from 90% to 60% led to a predicted rise in SBP of 1.0 mmHg and three additional CVD events per 1000 treated patients; larger predicted differences were observed for irbesartan (2.5 mmHg; 7.5 events/1000 treated patients) and ramipril (2.2 mmHg; 6.7 events/1000 treated patients).
AB  - CONCLUSION: To offset the effects of imperfect adherence, a common challenge with antihypertensives, for better BP management it may be prudent to prescribe 'forgiving' drugs.Copyright © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Adherence to antihypertensive therapy affects Ambulatory Arterial Stiffness Index.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major contributor to poor blood pressure (BP) control is nonadherence to therapy, which remains poorly recognized by physicians. The prevention of hypertension-induced changes in arterial wall, namely increased arterial stiffness and peripheral vascular resistance, is a reasoned adequate end-point of hypertension treatment. Indirect measurement of these arterial factors can be derived from the analysis of 24-hour Ambulatory BP Monitoring (24 h-ABPM). This pilot study evaluated the association between antihypertensive therapy adherence and 24 h-ABPM-derived parameters in hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: We studied 42 hypertensive patients (70+/-10 years) in chronic antihypertensive therapy. Patients were divided according to the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) in Low-Adher (MMAS <6) and High-Adher (MMAS 6-8) groups. The Ambulatory Arterial Stiffness Index (AASI) and its symmetric calculation (Sym_AASI) were derived from 24 h-ABPM. A bivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive value of MMAS for increased AASIs (i.e. above the median).
AB  - RESULTS: Low-Adher group (n=17) showed higher AASIs compared to High-Adher group (n=25). The two groups were similar in terms of BP burden at the 24 h-ABPM. AASIs were inversely related to MMAS. MMAS resulted a predictor for both increased AASI (O.R. 0.49, 95% CI 0.31-0.76, P<0.01) and increased Sym_AASI (O.R. 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.95, P=0.026). After adjustment for PP, age and nocturnal diastolic BP reduction, MMAS persisted as an inverse predictor only of increased AASI. MMAS was also related to the diastolic vs systolic BP correlation coefficient r.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Low adherence to antihypertensive therapy seems to be associated with increased standard AASI. In this setting, AASI could represent an additional information derived from the 24 h-ABPM in hypertensive patient evaluation.Copyright © 2010 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

TI  - Intergenerational transmission of chronic illness self-care: results from the caring for hypertension in African American families study.
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: African Americans often experience early onset of hypertension that can result in generations of adults managing high blood pressure concurrently. Using a model based on the Theory of Interdependence, this study examined whether intergenerational transmission of hypertension knowledge and self-efficacy would affect hypertension self-care of older parents and their adult children.
AB  - DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 95 African American older parent-adult child dyads with hypertension. We constructed separate logistic regression models for older parents and adult children with medication adherence as the outcome. Each model included individual demographic and health characteristics, the partner's knowledge, and self-efficacy to manage hypertension and dyad-related characteristics.
AB  - RESULTS: Parents were more adherent with medication than adult children (67.4% vs. 49.5%, p < .012). There were no significant factors associated with parent medication adherence. In adjusted models for adult children, medication adherence was associated with child's gender (odds ratio [OR] = 3.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26-8.59), parent beliefs that the child had better hypertension self-care (OR = 4.36, 95% CI = 1.34-14.17), and child reports that the dyad conversed about hypertension (OR = 3.48, 95% CI = 1.18-10.29). Parental knowledge of hypertension and parent's self-efficacy were weakly associated with adult children's medication adherence (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 0.99-1.84 and OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 0.94-7.12, respectively).
AB  - IMPLICATIONS: Interventions should consider targeting African American older adults to increase self-care knowledge and empower them as a primary influencer of hypertension self-care within the family.

TI  - Antihypertensive effectiveness of aliskiren for the 'real-world' management of hypertension: multilevel modelling of 180-day blood pressure outcomes (the Belgian DRIVER Study).
AB  - AIMS: The 'DRIVER' study was designed to investigate the 'real-world' effectiveness of aliskiren-based treatment of hypertension. This article reports the 180-day blood pressure (BP) outcomes, and the multilevel (physician- and patient-level) determinants thereof.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: DRIVER was a prospective, observational, open-label, multi-centre, pharmaco-epidemiologic study of hypertensive patients treated with aliskiren in whom prior treatment failed or was not tolerated. 2070 patients (enrolled by 426 physicians) were enrolled; 1695 patients (81.9%) completed the 180-day aliskiren treatment period. Mean patient age was 64.2 +/- 12.1 years; 53.7% were men, 25.3% diabetic and 40.7% had a high or very high cardiovascular (CV) risk. At 180 days, the mean +/- SD reductions in systolic and diastolic BP were -22.9 +/- 16.7 mmHg and -10.5 +/- 10.9 mmHg respectively (both p < .001). 2007 and 2009 guideline-defined BP control was achieved in 36.4% and 56.3% of patients, respectively (both p < .001). 64.2% of eligible patients had a reduction in CV risk (p < .001). A physician-level class effect was responsible for 22.8% and 28.1% of variability in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, for 20.1% of variability in BP control, and for 16.1% of variability in the reduction of CV risk. Both patient- (e.g. adherence) and physician-related factors (e.g. age and knowledge) were significant in profiling best response to treatment with aliskiren. Adverse events reported in this article were consistent with the aliskiren scientific leaflet.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Aliskiren is safe and effective in reducing BP, improving BP control and reducing global CV risk in a 'real-world' setting and for patients in whom prior treatment failed or was not tolerated. Optimising treatment adherence and strategic medical education may be ways of improving BP outcomes in patients with hypertension.Copyright © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Effects on blood pressure and cardiovascular risk of variations in patients' adherence to prescribed antihypertensive drugs: role of duration of drug action.
AB  - AIM: To determine the effects of imperfect adherence (i.e. occasionally missing prescribed doses), and the influence of rate of loss of antihypertensive effect during treatment interruption, on the predicted clinical effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs in reducing mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
AB  - METHOD: The effects of imperfect adherence to antihypertensive treatment regimens were estimated using published patterns of missed doses, and taking into account the rate of loss of antihypertensive effect when doses are missed (loss of BP reduction in mmHg/day; the off-rate), which varies between drugs. Outcome measures were the predicted mean SBP reduction and CVD risk, determined from the Framingham Risk Equation for CVD.
AB  - RESULTS: In patients taking 75% of prescribed doses (typical of clinical practice), only long-acting drugs with an off-rate of ~1 mmHg/day were predicted to maintain almost the full mean SBP-lowering effect throughout the modelled period. In such patients, using shorter-acting drugs (e.g. an off-rate of ~5-6 mmHg/day) was predicted to lead to a clinically relevant loss of mean SBP reduction of > 2 mmHg. This change also influenced the predicted CVD risk reduction; in patients with a baseline 10-year CVD risk of 27.0% and who were taking 75% of prescribed doses, a difference in off-rate from 1 to 5 mmHg/day led to a predicted 0.5% absolute increase in 10-year CVD risk.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In patients who occasionally miss doses of antihypertensives, modest differences in the rate of loss of antihypertensive effect following treatment interruption may have a clinically relevant impact on SBP reduction and CVD risk. While clinicians must make every effort to counsel and encourage each of their patients to adhere to their prescribed medication, it may also be prudent to prescribe drugs with a low off-rate to mitigate the potential consequences of missing doses.Copyright © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The effect of psychiatric comorbidity on hypertensive patients' perception of medication side-effects.
AB  - Arterial hypertension is a public health emergency in developing countries. Poor adherence is the most important cause of uncontrolled hypertension. Many patients cite medication adverse effects as the cause for non-adherence. It remains to be seen whether the perception of medication side-effects is a function of the patients' psychological state. We estimated the prevalence of medication intolerance in patients attending the cardiology outpatient department of a state medical college. We also distinguished between intolerance due medication side-effects that were specific to the particular drug(s) being used and that due to non-specific adverse effects. Thereafter the statistical correlation between intolerance (specific or non-specific) and psychiatric comorbidity in this population was estimated. Psychiatric comorbidity showed the highest correlation with intolerance due to non-specific side-effects of antihypertensive medications (p = 0.01). This was followed by male sex and duration of illness. The correlation remained valid even after adjusting for factors like presence of physical comorbidity, individual income per month, number of pills taken, number of doses per day and distance of referral centre from place of residence.

TI  - The effect of post-discharge educational intervention on patients in achieving objectives in modifiable risk factors six months after discharge following an episode of acute coronary syndrome, (CAM-2 Project): a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether an intervention mainly consisting of a signed agreement between patient and physician on the objectives to be reached, improves reaching these secondary prevention objectives in modifiable cardiovascular risk factors six-months after discharge following an acute coronary syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is room to improve mid-term adherence to clinical guidelines' recommendations in coronary heart disease secondary prevention, specially non-pharmacological ones, often neglected.
AB  - METHODS: In CAM-2, patients discharged after an acute coronary syndrome were randomly assigned to the intervention or the usual care group. The primary outcome was reaching therapeutic objectives in various secondary prevention variables: smoking, obesity, blood lipids, blood pressure control, exercise and taking of medication.
AB  - RESULTS: 1757 patients were recruited in 64 hospitals and 1510 (762 in the intervention and 748 in the control group) attended the six-months follow-up visit. After adjustment for potentially important variables, there were, between the intervention and control group, differences in the mean reduction of body mass index (0.5 vs. 0.2; p < 0.001) and waist circumference (1.6 cm vs. 0.6 cm; p = 0.05), proportion of patients who exercise regularly and those with total cholesterol below 175 mg/dl (64.7% vs. 56.5%; p = 0.001). The reported intake of medications was high in both groups for all the drugs considered with no differences except for statins (98.1% vs. 95.9%; p = 0.029).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: At least in the short term, lifestyle changes among coronary heart disease patients are achievable by intensifying the responsibility of the patient himself by means of a simple and feasible intervention.

TI  - High adherence and concordance within a clinical trial of antihypertensives.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore hypertensive patients' beliefs about their condition and its treatment and their adherence within the context of a clinical trial. To assess the degree of concordance between patients' beliefs about hypertension and the medical model of the condition.
AB  - METHODS: This was a questionnaire-based study, involving 230 patients participating in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), a randomized controlled trial comparing two pharmaceutical approaches to the management of hypertension. A comparison group of 106 hypertensive patients who were screened for ASCOT but did not meet the entry criteria was also recruited. Outcome measures were beliefs about hypertension and antihypertensive medication, and adherence to medication (self-report and tablet count).
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence to medication was higher than anticipated, with 45% participants reporting complete adherence over the 18-month study and a further 40% only rare non-adherence. Patients' beliefs about their condition and treatment were generally concordant with the medical model of hypertension. High concordance was associated with high medication adherence (p<0.001).
AB  - DISCUSSION: Clinical trial volunteers may have beliefs that are unusually concordant with the medical model of hypertension and may demonstrate atypically high adherence. This has implications for the transferability of trial findings to the general hypertensive population.

TI  - The effect of minority status and rural residence on actions to control high blood pressure in the U.S.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined actions to control high blood pressure (HBP) and health-care provider recommendations for blood pressure control among adults by racial/ethnic group and rural/urban residence.
AB  - METHODS: We examined data from 45,024 participants with HBP in the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. We used multiple logistic regression analyses to assess the independent association between current actions to control HBP and health-care provider recommendations for blood pressure control by race/ethnicity and rural/urban status after accounting for confounders.
AB  - RESULTS: Black people, regardless of rural or urban residence, were more likely to report reducing salt and alcohol intake, changing eating habits, and taking medications than both white urban and white rural adults. Black people, regardless of rural or urban status, were more likely to be advised to cut down on salt, reduce alcohol use, and change eating habits. Black rural adults were also more likely to report being advised to take medications than white urban adults, while white rural adults were less likely to be advised to exercise than white urban adults.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Race/ethnicity and rural/urban status have a differential effect on actions to control HBP and provider advice to control HBP.

TI  - [Influence of substitution of brand name for generic drugs on therapeutic compliance in hypertension and dyslipidemia]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine therapeutic compliance when brand name amlodipine and simvastatin are substituted for generic drugs, and to determine patients' and physicians' opinions of this substitution.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed an observational study with a control group, based on a review of the medical records in six primary care centers. Participants consisted of patients > 40 years old initiating treatment with a brand name drug (initial period), which was later substituted by a generic drug (final period). The study subgroups consisted of patients with hypertension (amlodipine) or dyslipidemia (simvastatin). The main measures were comorbidity, compliance, treatment length, biochemistry determinations, and patients' and physicians' opinions (interviews). All patients received a brand name drug for a minimum of 1 year followed by a generic drug for a minimum of 1 year (minimum continuation/patient: 24 months).
AB  - RESULTS: There were 1,252 patients (groups: 49.5% amlodipine; 50.5% simvastatin). Patients treated with amlodipine (period comparison) showed better compliance (65.8 vs. 61.3%; p=0.037) and blood pressure control (48.5 vs. 45.8%; p=0.039) with the brand name drug. The percentages with simvastatin were 62.8 vs. 58.4% (p=0.041), respectively. A total of 73.6% of the physicians interviewed prescribed generic drugs and 59.2% believed that both types of drug had the same efficacy. Most of the patients interviewed (79.8%; CI: 74.3-85.3%) accepted the substitution; 55.3% (CI: 48.5-62.1%) received the appropriate information but 61.5% were confused by the different products. Lack of compliance was reported by 18.2%.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In patients receiving amlodipine or simvastatin, compliance decreased with time, independently of the change from a band name to a generic drug.Copyright © 2010 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of hypertension on sexual function in women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: the effect of hypertension and its treatment on female sexual function is largely unexplored especially in Africa. However in practice, cases abound where consequent sexual dysfunction leads to poor or non-adherence with catastrophic results. Believing that like in males, hypertension and its treatment should affect female sexual function; we set out using a structured questionnaire to study the subject as it affects women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to examine the relationship between hypertension and female sexual functions of arousal, lubrication and orgasm.
AB  - METHODS: five hundred questionnaires were distributed to consenting Nigerian women after ethical clearance was obtained. Information sought included demographics, menstrual history, medical treatment and sexual function.
AB  - RESULTS: a total of 454 returned questionnaires were analysable. Out of this, 109(24%) admitted to being hypertensive, 89 of whom were on treatment. Hypertension was related to difficulty with sustaining sexual excitement (p=0.03), decreased sexual thoughts (p=0.003), poor rating of marriages (p=0.03), difficulty being excited by fantasies (p=0.0001), increased vaginal dryness in the preceding one year (p=0.02), reduced frequency of sexual contact in the last one year (p=0.04) and rejection of partner sexual advance (p=0.05). The proportion of women in regular sexual relationship was less among the hypertensive group (p=0.02). Use of drugs produced significant sexual unpleasantness (p=0.03).
AB  - CONCLUSION: hypertension and its treatment may produce female sexual dysfunction, and should be considered in managing the female hypertensive. By so doing, quality of life can be maintained; and compliance improved upon. The cumulative effect would be improvement in blood pressure control, with its attendant reduction in morbidity and mortality from hypertension.

TI  - Adherence and persistence of single-pill ARB/CCB combination therapy compared to multiple-pill ARB/CCB regimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs)/dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) single-pill combination (SPC) on adherence to antihypertensive treatment in comparison to free combination of ARBs and CCBs.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective data analysis was performed using pharmacy claims data from a national pharmacy benefit management company. The study included patients who were newly initiated on ARB/CCB treatment between 01/01/2007 and 08/31/2008, aged > 18 years, and continuously enrolled in the same health plan for 12 months prior to and 13 months after starting ARB/CCB treatment. Outcome variables were persistence, defined as time to discontinuation of therapy, and adherence, defined as proportion of days covered (PDC) > 0.80. Propensity score weighting was used to balance the characteristics of the two groups.
AB  - RESULTS: The final sample contained 2312 patients in the free-combination group and 2213 patients in the SPC group. Patients in the SPC group and the free-combination group were different in age, gender, type of insurance, history of antihypertensive therapy and co-morbidities. These differences were largely normalized after propensity score adjustment. Multivariate logistic model regression showed that patients in the SPC group had a 90% greater odds of being adherent to index therapy compared to patients in the free-combination group (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75-2.08, p< 0.001). A Cox proportional hazards model showed that patients in the SPC group were less likely to discontinue ARB/CCB SPC therapy compared to patients in the free-combination group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.63-0.70, p < 0.001). In both models, higher copayment (copayment $50 and above) was associated with worse persistence and adherence in comparison to patients who had a lower copayment ($0-$5): HR = 1.23, p < 0.001 and OR = 0.67, p < 0.001.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients using SPC ARB/CCB therapy were more likely to be persistent and adherent to treatment compared to patients taking free-combination therapy.

TI  - Efficacy, tolerability and safety of nebivolol in patients with hypertension and diabetes: a post-marketing surveillance study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is a widely prevalent condition of elevated blood pressure (BP) and is the leading risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many patients have additional risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM) or previous history of CVD. Nebivolol is a third-generation beta (beta)-blockers which has been shown not to influence metabolic parameters in patients with DM. This postmarketing surveillance study aimed to collect information on the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nebivolol in hypertensive patients with concomitant DM.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hypertensive patients with DM followed by 52 cardiologists, internal medicine specialists and general practitioners, between 24 August 2003 and 9 January 2007 in The Netherlands were included in this study. Physicians were asked to survey nebivolol treatment for 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 510 patients were enrolled. Overall, 93.3% of patients were diagnosed with essential hypertension and 6.7% with secondary hypertension. All patients were co-diagnosed with DM. Nebivolol therapy was associated with a significant reduction in both systolic blood pressure (BP) and diastolic BP versus baseline (p < 0.001 for both). These reductions were seen regardless of reason for initiation of nebivolol (i.e. first diagnosis of hypertension, resistance or intolerance to previous antihypertensive medication, or other reasons). A significant improvement in blood glucose was seen at 4 months (-0.6 mmol/L; p = 0.021). Significant reductions in total cholesterol (-1.45 mmol/L; p = 0.006), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (-1.32 mmol/L; p = 0.003) and LDL/high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio (-0.77; p = 0.011) were observed at 2 months. No significant changes were seen in HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Nebivolol treatment was associated with a significantly reduced BP, improved blood glucose and LDL cholesterol levels and was well tolerated in hypertensive patients with concomitant DM.

TI  - How to avoid discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment: The experience in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the importance of providing guidelines to patients via active telephone calls for blood pressure control and for preventing the discontinuation of treatment among hypertensive patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many reasons exist for non-adherence to medical regimens, and one of the strategies employed to improve treatment compliance is the use of active telephone calls.
AB  - METHODS: Hypertensive patients (n=354) who could receive telephone calls to remind them of their medical appointments and receive instruction about hypertension were distributed into two groups: a) "uncomplicated" - hypertensive patients with no other concurrent diseases and b) "complicated" - severe hypertensive patients (mean diastolic > 110 mmHg with or without medication) or patients with comorbidities. All patients, except those excluded (n=44), were open-block randomized to follow two treatment regimens ("traditional" or "current") and to receive or not receive telephone calls ("phone calls" and "no phone calls" groups, respectively).
AB  - RESULTS: Significantly fewer patients in the "phone calls" group discontinued treatment compared to those in the "no phone calls" group (4 vs. 30; p<0.0094). There was no difference in the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure in the "phone calls" group and "no phone calls" group or in the "traditional" and "current" groups. The percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) was increased at the end of the treatment (74%), reaching 80% in the "uncomplicated" group and 67% in the "complicated" group (p<0.000001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Guidance to patients via active telephone calls is an efficient strategy for preventing the discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment.

TI  - Study protocol: the Adherence and Intensification of Medications (AIM) study--a cluster randomized controlled effectiveness study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with diabetes have poor blood pressure (BP) control. Pharmacological therapy is the cornerstone of effective BP treatment, yet there are high rates both of poor medication adherence and failure to intensify medications. Successful medication management requires an effective partnership between providers who initiate and increase doses of effective medications and patients who adhere to the regimen.
AB  - METHODS: In this cluster-randomized controlled effectiveness study, primary care teams within sites were randomized to a program led by a clinical pharmacist trained in motivational interviewing-based behavioral counseling approaches and authorized to make BP medication changes or to usual care. This study involved the collection of data during a 14-month intervention period in three Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and two Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities. The clinical pharmacist was supported by clinical information systems that enabled proactive identification of, and outreach to, eligible patients identified on the basis of poor BP control and either medication refill gaps or lack of recent medication intensification. The primary outcome is the relative change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements over time. Secondary outcomes are changes in Hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), medication adherence determined from pharmacy refill data, and medication intensification rates.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Integration of the three intervention elements--proactive identification, adherence counseling and medication intensification--is essential to achieve optimal levels of control for high-risk patients. Testing the effectiveness of this intervention at the team level allows us to study the program as it would typically be implemented within a clinic setting, including how it integrates with other elements of care.

TI  - Management of chronic kidney disease: primary health-care setting, self-care and multidisciplinary approach.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a growing problem, particularly in developing countries. Factors closely related with lifestyle and dietary habits that negatively affect kidney function are rarely modified by isolated medical intervention. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine the effect of an educational program with a multidisciplinary health-care approach supported by self-help groups on the lifestyle and dietary habits of patients at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
AB  - PATIENTS: 51 patients with overweight/obesity, 45 with hypertension and 88 with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) from a Family Medicine Unit, who had failed to meet clinical practice recommendations, were studied over 6 months. Patients received educational intervention guided by a multidisciplinary health team for 4 weeks (including topics such as emotional management, nutritional patterns, exercise and health-related problems). Reinforcement of goals and group dynamics were performed every 3 months. Additionally, self-help groups were constituted during the first month, and functioned with free activities, selected by patients and supported by the health team, for the duration of the study. A lifestyle questionnaire was administered at baseline and the end of the study; clinical and biochemical evaluations were performed every 3 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Baseline lifestyle and dietary habits were unhealthy in all groups, particularly with regard to diet and exercise, and clinical and biochemical variables were concordant with inadequate achievement of clinical practice recommendations. After 6 months experience within this program, many of the negative lifestyle characteristics significantly improved. All groups reported a notable improvement in nutritional and exercise habits, as well as in management of the emotions. Only diabetic and hypertensive patients significantly improved the knowledge of their disease and adherence to treatment. None of the groups managed to reduce smoking or to cut their alcohol intake habits; however, relatively few participants had displayed these behaviors at the start of the study. Compared to baseline, all the groups significantly reduced body mass index and waist circumference. Additionally, diabetics and overweight/ obese patients significantly reduced blood glucose and increased GFR, and hypertensive patients significantly decreased systolic blood pressure and tended, although not significantly, to increase GFR. Remarkably, all these changes were independent of drug treatment, because none of the therapeutic interventions that had been formerly prescribed by family physicians had been significantly changed by the end of the follow-up in any of the groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of educational strategies comprising multiple interventions for patients, guided by health professionals (multidisciplinary teams including primary doctors, dietitians, nurses, social workers), and probably supported by self-help groups, may be very helpful in modifying negative lifestyle and dietary habits. Educational interventions by both doctors and patients should be adopted concurrently and may help to control the enormous and growing problem of ESRD.

TI  - Rationale and design of a randomized trial to evaluate an evidence-based prescription drug label on actual medication use.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication errors are an important public health concern, and poor understanding of medication labels are a root cause. Research shows that labels are variable, of poor quality, and not patient-centered. No real-world trials have evaluated whether improved medication labels can affect appropriate medication use, adherence or health outcomes.
AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: We developed an evidence-based prescription label that addresses both content and format. The enhanced label includes a universal medication schedule (UMS) that standardizes the directions for use incorporating 1) standard time periods for administration (morning, noon, evening, and bedtime), 2) numeric vs. alpha characters, 3) 'carriage returns' to separate daily dose and 4) a graphic aid to visually depict dose and frequency. We will evaluate the effect of providing this label to randomly sampled patients who receive their care from free clinics, mobile vans and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in Northern Virginia. We will recruit patients with diabetes or hypertension; these patients will be randomly assigned to receive all of their medications with improved labels or to receive prescriptions with standard labels. The primary outcome will be the patient's ability to correctly demonstrate dosing instructions. Other outcomes include adherence, error rates and health outcomes.
AB  - CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this trial is the first to evaluate the effect of prescription label improvement on understanding, medication use and outcomes in a clinical setting. If successful, these findings could be implemented broadly to promote safe and appropriate medication use and to support evidence-based standards in the development of labels.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Efficacy of a brief multifactorial adherence-based intervention on reducing the blood pressure of patients with poor adherence: protocol for a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lowering of blood pressure by antihypertensive drugs reduces the risks of cardiovascular events, stroke, and total mortality. However, poor adherence to antihypertensive medications reduces their effectiveness and increases the risk of adverse events. In terms of relative risk reduction, an improvement in medication adherence could be as effective as the development of a new drug.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed randomized controlled trial will include patients with a low adherence to medication and uncontrolled blood pressure. The intervention group will receive a multifactorial intervention during the first, third, and ninth months, to improve adherence. This intervention will include motivational interviews, pill reminders, family support, blood pressure self-recording, and simplification of the dosing regimen.
AB  - MEASUREMENT: The primary outcome is systolic blood pressure. The secondary outcomes are diastolic blood pressure, proportion of patients with adequately controlled blood pressure, and total cost.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The trial will evaluate the impact of a multifactorial adherence intervention in routine clinical practice. Ethical approval was given by the Ethical Committee on Human Research of Balearic islands, Spain (approval number IB 969/08 PI).

TI  - Randomized pilot study of a behavioral feedback intervention to improve medication adherence in older adults with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older adults' adherence to antihypertensive medications is far lower than what is considered necessary for clinical effectiveness, despite the risks for adverse cardiovascular events from uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) in the elderly. This pilot study tested a novel 8-week behavioral feedback intervention to improve antihypertensive medication adherence (MA) and BP control among older adults on existing treatment for hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Adults 60 years old, or older taking at least 1 antihypertensive medication were randomized to receive the nurse-delivered adherence intervention or usual care. Medication adherence was monitored continuously using electronic monitoring for 20 weeks. Intervention-group participants received biweekly MA and BP feedback, habit counseling, medication and disease education, a medication instruction card, and were given an electronic medication bottle cap with a digital display that provided daily adherence feedback during the 8-week intervention. Blood pressure was measured by a nurse at 12 and 20 weeks after randomization. Adherence and BP outcomes were described using descriptive statistics and analyzed for between- and within-group differences using Mann-Whitney U tests.
AB  - RESULTS: Fifteen participants (median age, 71 years; 73% female) were eligible for randomization. Participants took an average of 5.8 prescription medications and 2.93 over-the-counter medications per day. A nonsignificant difference was noted in baseline MA between groups. At the end of the intervention, the treatment group had better antihypertensive MA than did the control group (median MA: 100% vs 27.3%, U = 5.00, P = .013). Systolic BP improved slightly in the intervention group during the study and was significantly different at week 12 (median systolic BP: 130 vs 152 mm Hg; U = 4.50, P = .008). Diastolic BP was largely unchanged over the course of the study.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the intervention had a positive effect on MA. Additional testing is needed to further evaluate the intervention and its effect on adherence behavior and BP control.

TI  - Blood pressure and antihypertensive therapy according to the global cardiovascular risk level in Italy: the CHECK Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. In this study we assessed the excess of cardiovascular risk attributable to high BP and antihypertensive treatment in a sample of Italian patients enrolled by the 'Cholesterol and Health: Education, Control and Knowledge' (CHECK) study.
AB  - METHODS: CHECK is a large, cross-sectional epidemiological study, which randomly enrolled patients aged 40-79 years from 425 Italian General Practices from March 2002 to April 2004. Among 5731 patients enrolled in the study [49.6% men, mean age (standard deviation) 57.7 (10.3) years], 723 (12.6%) had 'optimal' BP, 1496 (26.1%) had 'high normal' BP, and 1942 (33.9%) were hypertensive.
AB  - RESULTS: According to the European Guidelines stratification of the cardiovascular risk-excess attributable to high BP, 34.7% of the sample had a low added risk and 53.2% had a moderate-to-very high added risk. The pharmacological therapy was prescribed in 22.3, 43.9, 61.4, and 76.9% of the patients with low, moderate, high, and very high added risk, respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Overall dietary and drug therapies are under prescribed, as most of the treated patients would require two additional antihypertensive drugs to meet the recommended BP target. This effort could provide significant individual benefit to moderate/high-risk patients.

TI  - Multidimensional analysis of treatment adherence in patients with multiple chronic conditions. A cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determine treatment adherence in patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC).
AB  - METHODS: A random patient sample > 15 years, discharged from hospital with >1 chronic conditions (CC) was interviewed after 6-12 months. Analysis included variables in 5 dimensions (WHO): socio-demographics, disease, treatment, patient and health system characteristics. Morisky-Green adherence questionnaire was used. High chronic treatment complexity was defined as: >3 pills/day, >6 inhalations/day, >1 injection/day, pharmacological treatment plus diet or self-monitoring techniques.
AB  - RESULTS: 301 patients were interviewed (62 +/- 15 years, 59% males). Despite good treatment information perception (79%), only 3% followed the patient education programme. Poor adherents (82%) were older (64 +/- 14 years vs. 55 +/- 16 years), had more CC (3.25 +/- 2.02 vs. 2.62 +/- 2.72), a higher frequency of hypertension (44% vs. 15%), ischaemic heart diseases: (21% vs. 4%), hyperlipidaemia (19% vs. 6%), more pills/day (5.78 +/- 4.14 vs. 3.20 +/- 4.70) and more complex treatments (95% vs. 70%) (p<0.05). On multivariate analysis number of CC [3.68 (0.75-18.15)], pills/day [2.23 (1.02-4.84)], treatment complexity [4.00 (1.45-11.04)], and hypertension [2.57 (1.06-6.25)] were predictive of poor adherence (OR 95% CI p<0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: The WHO conceptual framework allows the construction of poor adherence risk profiles in patients with MCC after hospital discharge.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Predictive variables of poor adherence could help clinicians detect patients with MCC most likely to present poor adherence.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - 3ST-POL trial: standards of statin use in Poland in the context of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Statins play a crucial role in modern cardiological pharmacotherapy. For the patient, as the beneficiary of an effective pharmacotherapy, it is of utmost importance that his or her physician can take maximum advantage of the whole potential of the available medications.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyse the effectiveness of statin treatment in Polish patients treated in an ambulatory setting, in view of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 49,950 ambulatory patients from Poland (women--53%, men--47%). The questionnaire consisted of 43 questions and was completed by a physician based on the results of physical examination, medical records, lipid profile, and additional tests. Twenty-eight per cent of the patients were obese, 37% were overweight, and more than 26% were smokers. The mean blood pressure was 142.9/84.0 mmHg (+/-18.5/11.6 mmHg). The target objectives of the pharmacological treatment of arterial hypertension were achieved in less than 25% of the study population. Nearly 50% of the patients had coronary artery disease, 20% had myocardial infarction, and 10% had transient ischemic attack or cerebral stroke. More than 30% of the patients had diabetes mellitus.
AB  - RESULTS: The most commonly used statins were atorvastatin and simvastatin (49.1% vs. 44.8%, respectively; P <0.05). Almost 71% of the patients received the daily statin dose of <20 mg. Mean total cholesterol (TC) was 244.9 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol--55 mg/dl, and triglycerides--180 mg/dl. TC levels of <190 mg/dl were achieved in 1 in 6 patients, and LDL levels of <115 mg/dl in less than 21% of the patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Despite the recommendation to administer statins at higher than minimum doses in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, this drug class is still underestimated by general practitioners.

TI  - [Medication of the month. Exforge HCT: combination of amlodipine besylate, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide in a single tablet]. [French]
AB  - Because of the multifactorial nature of hypertension, most patients require combination therapy to achieve blood pressure control. Very often the antihypertensive regimen includes a renin-angiotensin system blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic. Currently, several associations combining two antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These combination therapies are more efficient to control blood pressure through synergistic and additive effects, can reach target blood pressure more quickly, are likely to attenuate the side effects of each molecule, and could improve patient adherence. Exforge HCT is the first fixed-dose combination of three antihypertensive drugs including amlodipine besylate, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in a single pill. The association of these three drugs improves, with an equal tolerance, blood pressure control compared to dual therapies (valsartan/HCTZ, amlodipine/valsartan, or HCTZ/amlodipine). This triple therapy attenuates the diuretic-induced hypokalemia. The benefits of triple therapy over dual therapy are observed regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or baseline mean sitting systolic blood pressure. Exforge HCT is currently indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension, as replacement therapy for adult patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled by the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and HCTZ.

TI  - Multicenter cluster-randomized trial of a multifactorial intervention to improve antihypertensive medication adherence and blood pressure control among patients at high cardiovascular risk (the COM99 study).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence is common and results in preventable disease complications. This study assessed the effectiveness of a multifactorial intervention to improve both medication adherence and blood pressure control and to reduce cardiovascular events.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicenter, cluster-randomized trial, physicians from hospital-based hypertension clinics and primary care centers across Spain were randomized to receive and provide the intervention to their high-risk patients. Eligible patients were > 50 years of age, had uncontrolled hypertension, and had an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk greater than 30%. Physicians randomized to the intervention group counted patients' pills, designated a family member to support adherence behavior, and provided educational information to patients. The primary outcome was blood pressure control at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included both medication adherence and a composite end point of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. Seventy-nine physicians and 877 patients participated in the trial. The mean duration of follow-up was 39 months. Intervention patients were less likely to have an uncontrolled systolic blood pressure (odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.78) and were more likely to be adherent (odds ratio 1.91, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 3.05) than control group patients at 6 months. After 5 years, 16% of the patients in the intervention group and 19% in the control group met the composite end point (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.39).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifactorial intervention to improve adherence to antihypertensive medication was effective in improving both adherence and blood pressure control, but it did not appear to improve long-term cardiovascular events.

TI  - Self-reported adherence behavior in adolescent hypertensive patients: the role of illness representations and personality.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study examined the role that illness representations and personality play in the various adherence behaviors of adolescents diagnosed with essential hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: The participants were 97 hypertensive adolescents. They completed self-report questionnaires pertaining to (1) demographic and medical data, (2) adherence, (3) illness representations, and (4) personality. Medical charts were also assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: The hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) conscientiousness, agreeableness, and perception of treatment effectiveness account for a significant amount of variance in general adherence; (2) perception of treatment effectiveness is predictive of overall specific adherence; and (3) for adherence to most of the individual specific regimen recommendations, illness representations are more predictive compared to personality dimensions.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The personality domains of conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and illness representation dimensions (treatment control, concern, and emotional burden) were shown to predict adherence behaviors in adolescent hypertensive patients differentially. Study implications and limitations are discussed.

TI  - Monitoring adherence to medication by measuring change in blood pressure.
AB  - After starting antihypertensives, blood pressure is monitored for several reasons, including assessment of adherence. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of blood pressure monitoring for detecting early nonadherence. We conducted a secondary analysis of the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), a large randomized trial of blood pressure lowering to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. We compared change in blood pressure 3 months after randomization in people who had discontinued treatment (nonadherent) with those who stayed on treatment (adherent). We also used an indirect method, assessing whether change in blood pressure discriminated between active (adherent) and placebo (nonadherent) groups. Both methods gave similar results. For the 3433 subjects, the mean (SD) of the change in systolic blood pressure was -15.8 mm Hg (SD 18.7 mm Hg) in the adherent group and -4.2 mm Hg (SD 18.1 mm Hg) in the nonadherent group. After recalibration of the mean change in the nonadherent group to 0 mm Hg and in the adherent group to -11.6 mm Hg, the absence of a fall in systolic blood pressure at 3 months had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 80% for detecting nonadherence (50% of nonadherent patients and 20% of adherent patients had a rise in blood pressure). Discriminatory power was modest over the range of cutoffs (area under the receiver-operator curve 0.67). Monitoring blood pressure is poor at detecting nonadherence to blood pressure-lowering treatment. Further research should look at other methods of assessing adherence.

TI  - Trust in physicians and blood pressure control in blacks and whites being treated for hypertension in the REGARDS study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Among persons treated for hypertension, Blacks are more likely to have uncontrolled blood pressure compared to Whites. Few studies have focused on trust in physicians as a potential contributor to this disparity in blood pressure (BP) control. The primary objective of this study was to assess the relationship between trust in physicians and blood pressure control among Blacks and Whites being treated for hypertension.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data collected from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke cohort, a US national, population-based cohort study. Participants were recruited by telephone from 2003-2007, completed a telephone survey, and had BP measured during an in-home visit.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 2843 Black and White adults aged > 45 years with treated hypertension.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uncontrolled blood pressure was defined as systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg. For participants with diabetes, renal disease, or self-reported previous myocardial infarction, uncontrolled blood pressure was defined as systolic blood pressure > 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 80 mm Hg.
AB  - RESULTS: Trust in physicians was not associated with uncontrolled blood pressure in either unadjusted (odd ratio [OR] 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI) 0.92, 1.25) or adjusted analyses (OR 0.97; 0.83, 1.14). Both Black race (OR 1.58; 1.36, 1.84) and imperfect medication adherence (OR 1.56; 1.31,1.86) were associated with higher odds of uncontrolled blood pressure.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Trust in physicians was not related to blood pressure control among Blacks and Whites with treated hypertension in this sample. The racial disparity in blood pressure control was not completely explained by trust in physicians or medication adherence, and a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to this disparity is needed.

TI  - Effects of 8 weeks sustained follow-up after a nurse consultation on hypertension: a randomised trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of hypertension is high, but the overall control rate is low. Poor control of, hypertension is associated with a number of diseases, such as stroke, heart and renal failure, and high, mortality rates. Studies have shown the separate effects of nurse clinics and telephone follow-up on, blood pressure control, but the incremental effect of combining the two interventions is unknown.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examines whether there is an incremental effect on blood pressure control when using a nurse clinic combined with telephone follow-up.
AB  - METHODS: This was a randomised controlled trial. The primary outcome measure was blood pressure reading. The secondary outcome measures included adherence to home blood pressure monitoring, exercise, diet, medication, and satisfaction with care.
AB  - RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the baseline measures between the control and study groups. Significant differences were found at 8 weeks after intervention was initiated between groups in, systolic blood pressure (control -7.97 vs study -19.03, t=2.35, p=0.022, CI 1.66-20.47) and diastolic, blood pressure (control -3.72 vs study -11.68, t=3.02, p=0.004, CI 2.68-13.24). Other variables with a significant between-group differences (p<0.05) were blood pressure control rate, adherence, to home blood pressure monitoring, exercise and satisfaction with care. Further analysis using, regression showed that home blood pressure monitoring is the most significant predictor for improved, systolic blood pressure.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that nurse clinics have positive effects on blood pressure control and adherence to healthy lifestyle, but telephone follow-up after such clinics augments the effects of the clinic consultation. This combined mode of services is worth considering for other chronic disease, management programmes.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Implementation of adherence support for patients with hypertension despite antihypertensive therapy in general practice: a cluster randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment is highly prevalent among hypertension patients. Electronic monitoring of medication adherence has been proven to be effective in improving blood pressure. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of intensive support for implementation of this tool in community pharmacies with minimal implementation support.
AB  - METHODS: In a cluster randomized trial, 25 control pharmacies received a manual and 32 experimental pharmacies received intensive support to enhance implementation of electronic monitoring.
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOME: the number of patients included for electronic monitoring. Secondary outcomes included mean change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and percentage of patients with adequate SBP control.
AB  - RESULTS: The experimental group yielded consistently higher scores on all the steps of the implementation process than the control group, but none of these differences were significant. The mean number of patients per pharmacy included for electronic monitoring in a 3-9-months period was 1.6 in the experimental group vs. 1.0 in the control group (difference = 0.7, 95% confidence interval = -0.4; 1.7). The following patient outcomes were pooled because there were no differences between the experimental and the control group. Mean change of SBP/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was -12 and -6 mm Hg, respectively, SBP dropped <140 mm Hg in 20.9% of all patients. In 13.6% of all patients control of SBP was achieved without treatment intensification.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intensive implementation program enhanced pharmacist performance, but appeared insufficient to overcome all problems with the implementation of electronic monitoring. The major restrictive factors concerned general practitioner (GP) involvement and the identification of eligible patients.

TI  - Low medication adherence and hypertension control among adults with CKD: data from the REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low adherence to antihypertensive medication is an important barrier to achieving blood pressure control. Few data are available for medication adherence in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
AB  - SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 3,936 and 9,129 participants with and without CKD using antihypertensive medication in the REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) Study, respectively. CKD was defined as albuminuria with albumin excretion>or=30 mg/g or estimated glomerular filtration rate<60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
AB  - OUTCOMES: Medication adherence and uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Medication adherence was assessed using a validated 4-item scale. Blood pressure was measured 2 times by trained staff.
AB  - RESULTS: In REGARDS participants with and without CKD, 1,426 (36.2%) and 2,421 (26.5%) had uncontrolled hypertension with blood pressure>or=140/90 mm Hg, and 2,656 (67.5%) and 5,627 (61.6%), >or=130/80 mm Hg. Also, 27.7% of those with CKD and 27.9% of those without CKD responded "yes" to ever forgetting to take their medication and 4.4% and 4.2%, respectively, responded yes to being careless about taking their medication. Also, 5.7% and 5.3% responded yes to missing taking medication when they felt better, and 4.2% and 3.6%, to missing it when they felt sick. Overall, 23.3% and 23.7% of participants with and without CKD responded yes to 1 adherence question, whereas 7.7% and 7.2%, respectively, responded yes to 2 or more adherence questions. In those with CKD, the multivariable adjusted ORs for uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure>or=140/90 mm Hg) for individuals answering yes to 1 and 2 or more versus 0 adherence questions were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.05-1.51) and 1.49 (95% CI, 1.12-1.98), respectively. Analogous ORs for systolic/diastolic blood pressure>or=130/80 mm Hg were 1.06 (95% CI, 0.78-1.45) and 1.20 (95% CI, 0.88-1.64).
AB  - LIMITATIONS: Pharmacy fill data were not available.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with CKD had similarly poor medication-taking behaviors as those without CKD.Copyright (c) 2010 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Keep on track: a volunteer-run community-based intervention to lower blood pressure in older adults.
AB  - Uncontrolled hypertension in older adults is a common yet preventable threat to healthy aging. Improvements in blood pressure (BP) control and related health outcomes require innovative approaches that reach beyond the clinical environment. Keep on Track (KOT), a volunteer-run, community-based BP-monitoring program that aims to lower BP of community-dwelling older adults through senior center programming, is described and evaluated. KOT is based on a New York City (NYC) Department for the Aging program that has been in existence for more than 20 years and is evaluated in six senior centers in low- to middle-income neighborhoods in NYC. Program design includes monitoring sessions every other week to measure and record participant BP. BP education is provided using low-literacy materials, and medication adherence is encouraged. Over 6 months of observation, 244 participants enrolled (mean age 73). Of the 181 (74%) with hypertension at baseline, 92% were previously aware of their condition, 78% were treated, and 31% were controlled. BP control among the treated was 42%. Forty-three percent of enrollees (n=105) were multiple-visit participants who experienced on average a 3.9-mmHg reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between the first and last program visit (95% confidence interval (CI)=-7.6 to -0.1, P=.04). Participants with an initial SBP greater than 160 mmHg (n=20) experienced on average a 20.9-mmHg reduction in SBP (95% CI=-32.4 to -9.4, P<.001). Areas for program improvement include greater attention to peer counseling and timely communication with participants' healthcare providers. Volunteer-run, community-based BP monitoring in senior centers may provide an effective, replicable model for reducing BP in older adults.

TI  - Awareness of hypertension: will it bring about a healthy lifestyle?.
AB  - Guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention recommend a non-pharmacological approach to reduce cardiovascular risk in those with elevated blood pressure. We assessed guideline adherence in hypertensives. This study was performed in the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-NL cohort, consisting of 40,011 subjects. From 1993 to 1997, participants completed questionnaires (disease history, lifestyle and diet), a physical examination was performed and blood samples were drawn. Differences in proportions of guideline targets met between aware and unaware hypertensives were studied. Of 8779 hypertensive subjects, 90% was aware of their hypertension. They more often adhered to guidelines than unaware hypertensive subjects with respect to intake of polyunsaturated fat:saturated fat (38.6% vs 33.2%), fibres (40.6% vs 34.2%), body mass index <27 kg m(-2) (53.8% vs 46.5%) and alcohol (79.7% vs 72.6%). Despite statistical significance, the magnitude of these differences was small. Our study suggests that prevalence of a healthy lifestyle according to the recommendations in guidelines is slightly better in subjects aware of hypertension. There seems to be ample room for improvement in implementing the guidelines. Probably, patient tailored interventions and a multisiciplinary and multimodality approach can support this improvement.

TI  - Does telephone follow-up improve blood pressure after minor stroke or TIA?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: hypertension is a common risk factor for stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and there is good evidence that blood pressure (BP) control prevents recurrent stroke. We investigated whether telephone follow-up (TFU) improved risk factor management in hypertensive patients after stroke/TIA.
AB  - METHODS: we conducted a randomised controlled trial and assigned hypertensive patients within 1 month of stroke or TIA to receive usual care (n = 27) or usual care plus regular TFU (n = 29). Primary outcome was the difference in 12 h ambulatory systolic BP change from baseline to 6 months (DeltaSBP) in both groups. TFU at 7 days, 1, 2 and 4 months included patient-focussed education and goal setting.
AB  - RESULTS: mean baseline BP was 145/83 mm Hg (standard deviation (SD) 21/14). There was no significant difference in DeltaSBP over 6 months with TFU. Median DeltaSBP was 0 mm Hg (interquartile range 19.5) in the TFU group and 3.0 mm Hg (20) fall in the usual care group (P = 0.29). Post hoc analysis showed that statin use increased from baseline to 6 months (P = 0.02) and cholesterol was significantly lower at 6 months in all patients (mean reduction 0.95 mmol/l; P < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: our study found TFU that promoted patient-led management of risk factors did not improve BP control over 6-month follow-up in primary care after stroke/TIA.

TI  - The economic consequences of non-adherence to lipid-lowering therapy: results from the Anglo-Scandinavian-Cardiac Outcomes Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to lipid-lowering therapy in clinical practice is less than ideal. Analysis of registry data has indicated that this is associated with poor outcomes. The objective of the present analysis was to assess the impact of high adherence to drug (defined as > 80% of days covered), compared with low adherence to drug (< 50% of days covered) in terms of risk of events and long-term economic consequences.
AB  - DESIGN: Open-label follow up of a randomised placebo-controlled trial in hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regression models were used to assess the hazard ratio of patients with high adherence compared with low adherence while controlling for cardiovascular risk. A Markov model was used to predict the long-term costs and health outcomes associated with poor adherence during the follow-up period.
AB  - RESULTS: Both statistical models indicated that high adherence is associated with improved prognosis [Cox model: 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.98, Poisson model hazard ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58-0.98]. Discounted at 3.5% per year, the Markov model predicts that as a consequence of higher adherence during the follow-up period, costs would be higher (1689 pounds per patient compared with 1323 pounds per patient) because of higher drug costs, but the projected survival and quality-adjusted survival (QALY) would also be longer (10.83 compared with 10.81 life years and 8.13 compared with 8.11 QALYs).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Given the higher risk of cardiovascular events associated with low adherence shown here, measures to improve adherence are an important part of the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Morbidity and mortality on combination versus monotherapy: a posthoc analysis of the Systolic Hypertension in Europe trial.[Erratum appears in J Hypertens. 2010 Jun;28(6):1347-8]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current literature supports the immediate use of combinations of antihypertensive drugs in terms of ease of use and adherence, but the key issue whether combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy in the prevention of cardiovascular complications remains unproven.
AB  - METHODS: We analysed the double-blind (median follow-up 2.0 years) and open follow-up (6.0 years) phases of the Systolic Hypertension in Europe trial. Patients were 60 years or more with an entry systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 160-219/less than 95 mmHg. Antihypertensive treatment started immediately after randomization in the active-treatment group, but only after completion of the double-blind trial in control patients. Treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day). We adjusted our analyses for sex, age, history of cardiovascular complications, baseline systolic BP and previous antihypertensive treatment.
AB  - RESULTS: During the double-blind trial, adding enalapril to nitrendipine (n = 515), compared with the equivalent combination of placebos (n = 559), decreased systolic BP by a further 9.5 mmHg and reduced all cardiovascular events by 51% (P = 0.0035) and heart failure by 66% (P = 0.032), with similar trends for stroke (-51%; P = 0.066) and cardiac events (-44%; P = 0.075). Over the whole duration of follow-up, combination therapy (n = 871), compared with nitrendipine monotherapy (n = 1552), decreased systolic BP by 3.1 mmHg and reduced total mortality (-32%; P = 0.023), with similar trends for all cardiovascular events (-23%; P = 0.081) and stroke (-42%; P = 0.054).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of a posthoc analysis, but congruent with the stronger BP reduction, our results suggest that combination therapy with nitrendipine plus enalapril might improve outcome over and beyond the benefits seen with nitrendipine monotherapy.

TI  - Assessment of time to follow-up visits in newly-treated hypertensive patients using an electronic medical record database.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Use of electronic medical record (EMR) data for evaluating healthcare processes and outcomes is relatively new. Using EMR data, this study evaluated the time from antihypertensive initiation to the first follow-up office visit controlling for adverse events (AEs) and other factors that could influence follow-up timing. Findings were compared to treatment guidelines which recommend monthly follow-up in treatment naive patients until blood pressure (BP) levels are controlled.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Treatment-naive hypertensive adult patients in the General Electric Centricity EMR database (1996-2006) with a new antihypertensive prescription were evaluated. Time from treatment initiation to first office visit was identified and stratified by occurrence of AEs and therapy change. BP was assessed at 120 +/- 30 days.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean +/- SD time from first antihypertensive prescription (index date) to the first office visit was 96.2 +/- 160.6 days; 38% returned within a month of treatment initiation. Controlling for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, the adjusted time until first office visit was shorter for those with an AE and therapy change than for those with neither event (61 vs. 158 days). Of the patients with follow-up BP data for analysis (n = 27,875), more of those seen within a month of treatment initiation achieved BP goal at 120 days (<140/90 mmHg) than those who were not seen within a month (64.3 vs. 61.7% respectively; p < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that EMR data can be used to assess quality measures which in turn can inform efforts to improve treatment outcomes. Specifically, this study evaluated mean time to first office visit after antihypertensive therapy initiation controlling for clinical factors that could influence office visit intervals based on data available in a national EMR dataset. A key limitation of this study is that the EMR may not represent patient care delivered by other providers, thus, use of antihypertensives, changes in therapy, and office visits may be underreported.

TI  - Efficacy of fixed-dose combination therapy in the treatment of patients with hypertension: focus on amlodipine/valsartan. [Review]
AB  - Early initiation of rational and effective combination therapy consisting of antihypertensive drugs with two different and complementary mechanisms of actions is increasingly becoming accepted in clinical practice and by guidelines as a first-line approach to control blood pressure (BP) and prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Once-daily combination therapy provides more rapid control of BP, which is important for preventing cardiovascular events, with similar or improved tolerability compared with the component monotherapies, and improved adherence because of regimen simplification. Combination therapy with a calcium channel antagonist (calcium channel blocker [CCB]) and an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a rational approach to achieve BP goals and provide protection against renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations, including CCB/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and CCB/ angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) combinations are available as fixed-dose formulations. There is substantial evidence for the BP-lowering efficacy of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations in diverse patient populations, and their use in combination is associated with favourable tolerability and fewer adverse metabolic effects than some other combination therapies. Recent evidence from large outcome trials supports the use of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations for reducing the risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly in high-risk patients, together with evidence that the benefits of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations may extend beyond their efficacy in lowering BP in terms of protecting against fatal and nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths. The efficacy of the CCB amlodipine and the ARB valsartan in lowering BP and protecting against cardiovascular events and stroke across a range of hypertensive patient populations has been established over many years. Fixed-dose amlodipine/valsartan combinations are available in many countries and have shown greater BP reductions and better BP control than the respective monotherapies in diverse patient populations, together with a favourable tolerability profile. Once-daily amlodipine/valsartan is a rational and convenient treatment option for the effective management of patients with hypertension, improving adherence to antihypertensive medication and protecting against cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Use of home blood pressure monitoring and exercise, diet and medication compliance in Japan.
AB  - Little is known about the attitudes of doctors and patients to the use of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and its relationship with compliance to exercise, diet, and antihypertensive medication and blood pressure (BP) control. We conducted a cross-sectional internet survey in treated patients with hypertension in Japan. Overall, 500 questionnaires were returned; 292 respondents (58.4%) reported that their doctor had recommended HBPM and among them 106 (36.3%) reported satisfactory adherence to HBPM. Compared to patients with poor adherence to HBPM, patients with satisfactory adherence to HBPM were more likely to have satisfactory compliance with exercise, diet and medication but no significant difference in BP control.

TI  - Understanding racial disparities in treatment intensification for hypertension management.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disparities in blood pressure (BP) control may be a function of disparities in treatment intensification (TI).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine racial differences in TI, understand modifiable factors that may mediate this relationship, and explore the relative effects of TI and race on blood pressure.
AB  - DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 819 black and white patients with hypertension from an urban, safety-net hospital
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: We sequentially explored the effects of patient race, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, beliefs about BP/medications, perceptions of provider/discrimination, sodium intake, medication adherence, and provider counseling on TI, performing a series of random effects analyses. To assess the effects of race and TI on BP, we performed linear regressions, using systolic BP (SBP) as the outcome.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Unadjusted analyses and those including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics revealed that black patients had less TI than whites (-0.31 vs.-0.24, p < 0.001), but adjustment for patient beliefs and experiences eliminated the effects of race (beta =-0.02, p = 0.5). Increased patient concerns about BP medications were related to lower TI, as was more provider counseling (beta =-0.06, p = 0.02 and beta = -0.01, p = 0.001, respectively). In the unadjusted analysis, black race was a significant predictor of SBP (134 mm/Hg for blacks vs. 131 mm/Hg for whites, p = 0.009), but when both race and TI were included in the model, TI was a significant predictor of SBP (final SBP 2.0 mm/Hg lower for each additional therapy increase per 10 visits, p < 0.001), while race was not (Blacks 1.6 mm/Hg higher than whites, p = 0.17).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Improved patient-provider communication targeted towards addressing patient concerns about medications may have the potential to reduce racial disparities in TI and ultimately, BP control.

TI  - Improvement of hypertension management by structured physician education and feedback system: cluster randomized trial.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess whether hypertension management with a structured physician information program and a feedback system leads to improved blood pressure (BP) control and cardiovascular outcomes.
AB  - METHODS: Cluster randomized (3 : 1), open, monitored, multicenter trial in Germany. Primary care-based physicians in the information group (IG) received detailed training on hypertension guidelines, feedback on target-level attainment, and a reminder to intensify treatment after each patient visit, whereas the observation/control group (CG) did not receive any such measures. A three-level mixed model was developed. Time-independent level differences between groups, group-independent changes, and nonparallel group-specific changes over time were tested.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 15 041 (78.1%) hypertensive patients were in the IG and 4213 (21.9%) in the CG. By 1-year follow-up, 82.9% of patients in the IG and 81.5% in the CG remained in the study. The guideline-oriented BP target was attained by 56.8% in the IG and 52.5% in the CG (+4.3%, P = 0.03), whereas the individual BP target was attained by 57.0% in the IG and 51% in the CG (P = NS). BP control in the IG was achieved 2 months earlier on average. Clinical inertia, defined as the absence of medication changes, despite noncontrol of BP, occurred significantly less often in the IG group. One-year cardiovascular outcomes did not differ between groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The delivery of systematic information in connection with a feedback system reduces clinical inertia and improves guideline adherence. Although compared with earlier studies, the hypertension control rates obtained are higher, there is still considerable room for improvement.

TI  - Safety and tolerability of an olmesartan medoxomil-based regimen in patients with stage 1 hypertension: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the reasons for suboptimal blood pressure (BP) control in patients with hypertension is poor adherence to treatment, which may be caused by treatment-emergent adverse events. Therefore, it is crucial for an antihypertensive agent to provide a high level of efficacy without compromising tolerability.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a titrate-to-goal, olmesartan medoxomil-based therapy in patients with stage 1 hypertension (seated systolic BP [SeSBP] of 140-159 mmHg or seated diastolic BP [SeDBP] of 90-99 mmHg).
AB  - METHODS: This was a pre-specified analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre (29 sites) clinical study conducted from January to October 2007 in the US. Male and female patients (n = 130) aged >or=18 years with stage 1 hypertension were included in the analysis. Patients were treated with either placebo or an olmesartan medoxomil-based titration regimen, which comprised treatment with olmesartan medoxomil plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as required to achieve a target BP of <120/80 mmHg. The current analysis focused on the safety of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with stage 1 hypertension, particularly in terms of discontinuation rates and the incidence of dizziness and orthostatic hypotension. Safety and tolerability were assessed throughout the study. The primary efficacy outcome was the least-squares (LS) mean change from baseline in SeSBP after 12 weeks' double-blind treatment. Additional efficacy variables included LS mean change from baseline in SeDBP at 12 weeks and the proportions of patients achieving BP goals at study end and at each titration step.
AB  - RESULTS: In patients with stage 1 hypertension, the olmesartan medoxomil-based regimen was generally well tolerated at all titration steps, and discontinuation due to adverse events was similar between olmesartan medoxomil and placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 16.1% up to 27.6% of olmesartan medoxomil recipients and between 8.3% and 24.3% of placebo recipients, across treatment regimens; a slight increase in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was observed with olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ versus olmesartan medoxomil alone (<or=27.6% vs <or=19.3%). In addition, one or more drug-related events were reported in up to 10.3% of olmesartan medoxomil recipients and up to 5.7% of placebo recipients. Gastrointestinal disorders (<or=10.0%), nervous system disorders (<or=10.3%), and infections/infestations (<or=7.1%) were the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events in the olmesartan medoxomil treatment group. The most common nervous system disorders in the olmesartan medoxomil treatment group were dizziness (<or=6.9%) and headache (<or=5.4%). Orthostatic hypotension was not reported. The LS mean differences between olmesartan medoxomil and placebo for change from baseline in SeSBP (-22.0 mmHg; 95% confidence interval [CI] -26.9, -17.3) and SeDBP (-12.2 mmHg; 95% CI -14.9, -9.4; both p < 0.0001) significantly favoured olmesartan medoxomil at week 12 with last observation carried forward. At study end, a BP goal of <140/90 mmHg was achieved by 81.0% of patients in the olmesartan medoxomil group versus 43.1% of patients in the placebo group (p < 0.0001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Olmesartan medoxomil-based therapy was well tolerated in this study among patients with stage 1 hypertension and demonstrated a placebo-like safety and tolerability profile. This regimen was also effective in terms of BP lowering and enabling patients to achieve BP goals without an adverse effect on tolerability.

TI  - Does a single-pill antihypertensive/lipid-lowering regimen improve adherence in US managed care enrolees? A non-randomized, observational, retrospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous study in 4703 patients suggested that a single-pill combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin is associated with greater adherence to therapy than a two-pill calcium channel antagonist (calcium channel blocker [CCB]) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) regimen. However, the impact of prior medication use on the potential adherence benefits of single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin has not been studied.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare adherence to single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin versus two-pill CCB + statin regimens in a large managed care population, stratified according to prior CCB and statin use.
AB  - METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted among managed care enrolees in the US. Patients included in the analysis had to have a pharmacy claim for single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin or claims for both a CCB and a statin within any 30-day window between April 2004 and April 2005. Adherence was measured over 6 months following the index date (the date of the first single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin claim or of the claim for the second medication class for any two-pill CCB + statin regimen) as the proportion of days covered (PDC) by both CCB and statin therapy; patients were considered 'adherent' if PDC was > or =80%. Patients were divided into four cohorts based on pre-index CCB and statin use: (i) naive (CCB)/naive (statin); (ii) experienced (CCB)/naive (statin); (iii) naive (CCB)/experienced (statin); and (iv) experienced (CCB)/experienced (statin). Within each cohort, adherence was compared for patients receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin versus two-pill amlodipine + atorvastatin or other two-pill CCB + statin regimens (including amlodipine or atorvastatin but not both) at index. Multivariable logistic regression with propensity score weighting was used to adjust for covariates, including age, sex and co-morbidities.
AB  - RESULTS: In total, 35,430 patients were included in the analysis. At month 6 (after adjusting for covariates), patients in the experienced (CCB)/naive (statin) cohort receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin were more than twice as likely to be adherent as those receiving two-pill amlodipine + atorvastatin (odds ratio [OR] 2.20; p < 0.0001) or other two-pill CCB + statin regimens (OR 2.75; p < 0.0001). Similarly, patients in the naive (CCB)/experienced (statin) cohort receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin were more likely to be adherent than those receiving two-pill amlodipine + atorvastatin (OR 1.72; p < 0.0001) or other two-pill CCB + statin regimens (OR 2.81; p < 0.0001). In contrast, in the naive (CCB)/naive (statin) cohort there was no significant difference in adherence between patients receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin versus two-pill amlodipine + atorvastatin (OR 1.00), although patients receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin were slightly more likely to be adherent than those receiving other two-pill CCB + statin regimens (OR 1.29; p < 0.01). In the experienced (CCB)/experienced (statin) cohort there was also no significant difference between patients receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin versus two-pill amlodipine + atorvastatin (OR 1.08), and only a slightly greater likelihood of achieving adherence to single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin versus other two-pill CCB + statin regimens (OR 1.19; p < 0.01).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This large retrospective study confirms previous observations that single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin can help improve adherence versus two-pill CCB + statin regimens. However, greater improvements in adherence are likely to be observed in patients with prior experience of either CCB or statin therapy than in those either naive to, or experienced with, both therapies.

TI  - The effect of language preference on prenatal weight gain and postpartum weight retention in urban Hispanic women.[Summary for patients in Ethn Dis. 2010 Spring;20(2):195-6; PMID: 20506599]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe prenatal weight gain and postpartum loss patterns among Hispanic women receiving prenatal care at an urban community health center by language preference.
AB  - METHODS: Data were abstracted from medical records of prenatal patients seen from 2000-2008. Included were self-identified Hispanic women, English- or Spanish-speaking, aged 16-40 years, with weight measured at < or =13 and at >37 weeks gestation. Women with preexisting diabetes, hypertension, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, multiple gestation, or preterm delivery were excluded. Bivariate (t-test, chi-square) and multivariate regression (linear, polychotomous logistic) statistics were used in the analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 259 women who met eligibility criteria, 52 (20.1%) were primarily Spanish speakers. Overall, 43.6% exceeded prenatal weightgain recommendations; 30.8% of Spanish speakers vs 46.9% of English speakers (P=.07). Among normal-weight women, Spanish speakers gained below and English speakers gained above that recommended (P=.03). At late postpartum, 22.9% overall returned to their baseline body mass index (BMI +/-0.5 kg/m2); Spanish speakers retained 1.21 vs 1.53 kg/m2 among English speakers, which was not statistically significant. Adjusting for baseline BMI, age, and smoking status, language preference was not associated with prenatal weight gain or postpartum weight retention. In adjusted models, being overweight at baseline was predictive of excessive prenatal weight gain (OR 2.12, 95% CI .99, 4.53; P=.05); older age was protective for postpartum weight retention (OR .90; 95% CI .82, .98; P=.02).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to prenatal weight gain guidelines was poor and few women returned to their baseline weight at late postpartum, regardless of language preference.

TI  - Renal function, cardiovascular disease risk factors' prevalence and 5-year disease incidence; the role of diet, exercise, lipids and inflammation markers: the ATTICA study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the association between renal function and various cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, as well as 5-year incidence of CVD, in a sample of CVD free adults.
AB  - METHODS: (i) Cross-sectional information from n = 1975. Greek men and women (>18 years) without CVD and hypertension at baseline examination and (ii) 5-year (2001-06) survival data from n = 2101 individuals without CVD at baseline, all participants in the ATTICA study, were analysed in this work. Kidney function was quantified by the baseline estimated creatinine clearance rate (C(cr)), using the Cockcroft-Gault formula and the National Kidney Foundation recommendations. Outcome of interest was the development of CVD that was defined according to WHO-ICD-10 criteria.
AB  - RESULTS: At baseline, the prevalence of moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction (i.e. C(cr) < 60) was 2.8% in males and 7.7% in females. Physical activity status, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia and homocysteine levels and greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet were inversely associated with C(cr) rate (P < 0.05), while no association was found with history of diabetes. During the 5-year follow-up, people with moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction as compared with normal, had 3.21 times higher CVD risk [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98-5.19], after adjusting for history of hypertension (hazard ratio = 2.15, 95% CI 1.48-3.11), hypercholesterolemia (1.37, 0.98-1.98), diabetes (3.28, 2.15-5.00), smoking habits (0.89, 0.60-1.32) and physical activity status (0.86, 0.56-1.21).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Renal function seems to be associated with the levels of lifestyle and bio-clinical CVD risk factors and contribute to the long-term incidence of cardiac events. Public health care practitioners should take into account renal function in better preventing the burden of CVD at individual, and population level, as well.

TI  - Does a colour-coded blood pressure diary improve blood pressure control for patients in general practice: the CoCo trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insufficient blood pressure control is a frequent problem despite the existence of effective treatment. Insufficient adherence to self-monitoring as well as to therapy is a common reason. Blood pressure self-measurement at home (Home Blood Pressure Measurement, HBPM) has positive effects on treatment adherence and is helpful in achieving the target blood pressure. Only a few studies have investigated whether adherence to HBPM can be improved through simple measures resulting also in better blood pressure control.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Improvement of self-monitoring and improved blood pressure control by using a new colour-coded blood pressure diary.
AB  - OUTCOME:
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOME: Change in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure 6 months after using the new colour-coded blood pressure diary.Secondary outcome: Adherence to blood pressure self-measurement (number of measurements/entries).
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Randomised controlled study.
AB  - POPULATION: 138 adult patients in primary care with uncontrolled hypertension despite therapy. The control group uses a conventional blood pressure diary; the intervention group uses the new colour-coded blood pressure diary (green, yellow, red according a traffic light system). EXPECTED RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The visual separation and entries in three colour-coded areas reflecting risk (green: blood pressure in the target range <or= 140/<or= 90 mmHg, yellow: blood pressure >140/>90 mmHg, red: blood pressure in danger zone > 180 mmHg/>110 mmHg) lead to better self-monitoring compared with the conventional (non-colour-coded) blood pressure booklet. The colour-coded, visualised information supports improved perception (awareness and interpretation) of blood pressure and triggers correct behaviour, in the means of improved adherence to the recommended treatment as well as better communication between patients and doctors resulting in improved blood pressure control.

TI  - Effects of proactive iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent protocol implementation on achieving clinical guideline targets for anaemia in a satellite haemodialysis patient cohort.
AB  - AIM: Anaemia management with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and i.v. iron replacement in haemodialysis patients poses several clinical challenges, including maintaining stable haemoglobin (Hb) levels within target ranges while achieving lowest effective ESA dose. This manuscript describes the effect of implementing proactive protocol-driven adjustments for iron and ESA in maintenance haemodialysis patients.
AB  - METHODS: This was a cohort study of 46 satellite haemodialysis patients examined from 2004 to 2006 with protocol implementation in 2005. Baseline haemoglobin, transferrin saturations (TSAT), ferritin values and ESA administration were obtained during 2004. Follow-up data was collected in 2006 and compared to baseline values in reference to specified targets in the 2004 Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment (CARI) guidelines.
AB  - RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of patients achieved haemoglobin targets during follow up versus 43% patients during baseline. Seventy-nine percent of patients achieved TSAT targets during follow up versus 67% patients during baseline. Ninety percent of patients achieved ferritin targets during follow up versus 75% patients during baseline. Odds ratios for values falling within target ranges during follow up compared to baseline were 1.63 (Hb: P = 0.037; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-2.57), 1.90 (TSAT: P = 0.006; 95% CI, 1.20-3.01) and 3.72 (ferritin: P = 0.003; 95% CI, 1.57-8.83). There was a trend toward lower average ESA dose (P = 0.07).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the successful implementation and efficacy of a proactive protocol for iron and ESA treatment in haemodialysis patients. Benefits include increased concordance with historical guideline targets and decreased haemoglobin variability. Improved iron status and optimizing ESA response allows for lower ESA doses, limiting both potential side-effects of ESA (hypertension) and the burgeoning costs of anaemia management.

TI  - Effect of self-efficacy and social support on adherence to antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between poor adherence and self-efficacy or social support after a pharmacist intervention.
AB  - DESIGN: Post-hoc analysis of data from two randomized controlled trials of physician-pharmacist collaborative interventions (6 and 9 mo, respectively) to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - SETTING: Eleven university-affiliated primary care clinics.
AB  - PATIENTS: Five hundred eighty-four patients (aged 21-85 yrs) with uncontrolled primary hypertension; 296 were in the intervention group and 288 were in the control group.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Pharmacists provided intensified hypertension management and drug adherence counseling to patients in the intervention group.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Social support and self-efficacy questionnaires were administered at baseline and end-of-study visits. Patient adherence was monitored by using the Morisky self-reported adherence questionnaire. Self-reported adherence scores improved significantly in the control group (p=0.0053) but not in the intervention group; however, adherence at baseline in both groups was high. There were small, but significant, improvements in self-efficacy (p<0.04) and social support (p<0.05) scores in the intervention group but not the control group at the end of the study. Social support and, to a lesser extent, self-efficacy improved as a function of duration of study participation (9-mo vs 6-mo intervention), regardless of whether the patient received the intervention. Blood pressure control in both groups improved significantly at the end of the study; however, mean blood pressure was significantly lower in the intervention group (129.7/76.6 mm Hg) compared with the control group (140.8/78.9 mm Hg; p<0.0001 for systolic, p=0.032 for diastolic).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Social support and self-efficacy improved significantly in the intervention group at the end of the pharmacist intervention. Drug adherence was correlated with self-efficacy even though drug adherence did not improve significantly in the intervention group. The fact that social support and self-efficacy improved as a function of duration of study participation suggests that participation in a research study may have had a positive influence on these measures. Even though the changes in social support, self-efficacy, and drug adherence were modest, there was significantly better blood pressure control in the intervention group compared with the control group. These findings indicate that changes in drug adherence, self-efficacy, or social support probably played a minor role in the blood pressure outcomes in these studies.

TI  - The impact of Medicare Part D on medication adherence among older adults enrolled in Medicare-Advantage products.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about how Medicare Part D affects the medication refill adherence for cardiovascular and diabetes medications, particularly among beneficiaries without prior drug coverage.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate Medicare Part D's effect on medication adherence among beneficiaries with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and/or diabetes enrolled in Medicare Advantage products.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN: We used a quasi-experimental pre-post design, with 3 treatment groups and a comparison group, to assess the effect of Part D on several measures of adherence to prescription medications.
AB  - SUBJECTS: Adults aged 65 or older with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and/or diabetes in 2003 continuously enrolled between 2004 and 2007 in a large Pennsylvania insurer's Medicare Advantage products.
AB  - MEASURES: Medication possession ratios (MPR), good adherence with MPR >0.8, and intensity of treatment measured by average daily counts of pills per day of treatment.
AB  - RESULTS: Part D improved MPRs in the group without prior drug coverage by 13.4 percentage points (95% CI, 10.1-16.8), 17.9 (95% CI, 13.7-22.1), and 13.5 (95% CI, 11.5-15.5) for those with hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension, respectively. Adherence improved less in the other 2 groups with limited prior drug benefits. Although the proportion of beneficiaries in the intervention groups who attained good adherence levels increased after Part D, less than 50%, 68%, and 78% of beneficiaries with hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension, respectively, attained good adherence.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Part D increased adherence to medications that reduce the risk of cardiovascular events for patients with hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. This should improve the health of the elderly people in the long run.

TI  - Vitamins C and E to prevent complications of pregnancy-associated hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress has been proposed as a mechanism linking the poor placental perfusion characteristic of preeclampsia with the clinical manifestations of the disorder. We assessed the effects of antioxidant supplementation with vitamins C and E, initiated early in pregnancy, on the risk of serious adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes related to pregnancy-associated hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial involving nulliparous women who were at low risk for preeclampsia. Women were randomly assigned to begin daily supplementation with 1000 mg of vitamin C and 400 IU of vitamin E or matching placebo between the 9th and 16th weeks of pregnancy. The primary outcome was severe pregnancy-associated hypertension alone or severe or mild hypertension with elevated liver-enzyme levels, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum creatinine levels, eclamptic seizure, medically indicated preterm birth, fetal-growth restriction, or perinatal death.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 10,154 women underwent randomization. The two groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics and adherence to the study drug. Outcome data were available for 9969 women. There was no significant difference between the vitamin and placebo groups in the rates of the primary outcome (6.1% and 5.7%, respectively; relative risk in the vitamin group, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.25) or in the rates of preeclampsia (7.2% and 6.7%, respectively; relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.24). Rates of adverse perinatal outcomes did not differ significantly between the groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C and E supplementation initiated in the 9th to 16th week of pregnancy in an unselected cohort of low-risk, nulliparous women did not reduce the rate of adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes related to pregnancy-associated hypertension (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00135707).Copyright 2010 Massachusetts Medical Society

TI  - Evaluation of a community pharmacy-based intervention for improving patient adherence to antihypertensives: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of patients using antihypertensive medications fail to achieve their recommended target blood pressure. Poor daily adherence with medication regimens and a lack of persistence with medication use are two of the major reasons for failure to reach target blood pressure. There is no single intervention to improve adherence with antihypertensives that is consistently effective. Community pharmacists are in an ideal position to promote adherence to chronic medications. This study aims to test a specific intervention package that could be integrated into the community pharmacy workflow to enable pharmacists to improve patient adherence and/or persistence with antihypertensive medications--Hypertension Adherence Program in Pharmacy (HAPPY).
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The HAPPY trial is a multi-centre prospective randomised controlled trial. Fifty-six pharmacies have been recruited from three Australian states. To identify potential patients, a software application (MedeMine CVD) extracted data from a community pharmacy dispensing software system (FRED Dispense). The pharmacies have been randomised to either 'Pharmacist Care Group' (PCG) or 'Usual Care Group' (UCG). To check for 'Hawthorne effect' in the UCG, a third group of patients 'Hidden Control Group' (HCG) will be identified in the UCG pharmacies, which will be made known to the pharmacists at the end of six months. Each study group requires 182 patients. Data will be collected at baseline, three and six months in the PCG and at baseline and six months in the UCG. Changes in patient adherence and persistence at the end of six months will be measured using the self-reported Morisky score, the Tool for Adherence Behaviour Screening and medication refill data.
AB  - DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first research testing a comprehensive package of evidence-based interventions that could be integrated into the community pharmacy workflow to enable pharmacists to improve patient adherence and/or persistence with antihypertensive medications. The unique features of the HAPPY trial include the use of MedeMine CVD to identify patients who could potentially benefit from the service, control for the 'Hawthorne effect' in the UCG and the offer of the intervention package at the end of six months to patients in the UCG, a strategy that is expected to improve retention.

TI  - Deterioration of blood pressure control after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess blood pressure control after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention.
AB  - DESIGN: Comparative analysis of data of the patients who received the intervention versus a control group from a prospective, cluster-randomized, 9-month efficacy trial and the same patients' data 18 and 27 months after completion of the trial, abstracted from their medical records.
AB  - SETTING: Five primary care medical offices operated by a university health system.
AB  - PATIENTS: One hundred four patients with hypertension; 65 were in the intervention group, and 39 were in the control group.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the prospective study, patients were randomized to receive a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention to improve blood pressure control or to the control group. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured by a research nurse at baseline and at the end of the study (9 mo later). In the current study, data were abstracted for blood pressure and blood pressure control at 18 and 27 months (9 and 18 mo, respectively, after discontinuation of the study). At baseline, mean +/- SD systolic blood pressure was 152.5 +/- 9.5 and 150.1 +/- 9.6 mm Hg in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p=0.22). At 9 months, systolic blood pressure decreased to 124.5 +/- 10.7 and 132.0 +/- 15.1 mm Hg (p=0.0038 between groups), and blood pressure was controlled in 78.5% and 48.7% (p=0.0017) of patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively. By 18 months, systolic blood pressure had deteriorated to 131.0 +/- 12.2 and 143.3 +/- 17.5 mm Hg (p<0.001), and blood pressure control rates decreased to 53.9% and 30.8% (p=0.02). By 27 months, systolic blood pressure was 131.3 +/- 13.0 and 141.2 +/- 15.8 mm Hg (p=0.0008), and blood pressure control was 55.4% and 35.9% (p=0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: A sustained positive effect on blood pressure control was noted up to 18 months after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention, when compared with a control group. Blood pressure control did deteriorate at a similar rate in both the intervention and control groups, but the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure remained significantly higher in the intervention group. These results suggest that continued interventions by pharmacists may be necessary to maintain high rates of blood pressure control, especially in those patients whose blood pressure begins to increase.

TI  - Does the use of home blood pressure monitoring vary by race, education, and income?.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Home blood pressure (BP) monitors are commonly recommended for patients with hypertension, but little is known about their utilizations among different racial/ethnic groups. The objective of this study was to investigate if racial differences existed in the utilization of home BP monitoring devices.
AB  - DESIGN: A voluntary and self-administered survey study.
AB  - SETTING: Community pharmacies in the Greater Houston metropolitan areas, Texas, United States.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were recruited from community pharmacies if they were aged > or = 18 years and received a prescription drug for hypertension.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Each participant was given informed consent to complete a survey that consisted of questions about patient demographics and BP self-monitoring behavior.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measures were the use of home BP monitors and the patient's knowledge of BP monitoring.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 987 pharmacy customers were approached, of whom 834 patients agreed to participate (34.3% African Americans, 33.3% Whites, and 28.9% Hispanics). We found no association between race and BP monitor utilization. Patients with less education and lower income were associated with lesser use of BP monitors (P=.04 and P<.01 respectively). Patients with higher education and higher incomes were more knowledgeable about how to monitor BP at home. (P<.01).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This study found that the utilization of BP monitors was not different among races. Patients with lower education level and less income were associated with less home BP monitor use. Further studies to investigate the adherence to home BP monitor use and intervention to overcome barriers to self-monitoring is needed.

TI  - Effect of self-measurement of blood pressure on adherence to treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to treatment is one of the major problems in the treatment of hypertension. Self blood pressure measurement may help patients to improve their adherence to treatment.
AB  - METHOD: In this prospective, randomized, controlled study coordinated by a university hospital, a total of 228 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients were randomized to either a group that performed self-measurements at home in addition to office blood pressure measurements [the self-pressure group (n = 114)] or a group that only underwent office blood pressure measurement [the office pressure group (n = 114)]. Patients were followed for 1 year in which treatment was adjusted, if necessary, at each visit to the physician's office according to the achieved blood pressure. Adherence to treatment was assessed by means of medication event monitoring system TrackCaps.
AB  - RESULTS: Median adherence was slightly greater in patients from the self-pressure group than in those from the office pressure group (92.3 vs. 90.9%; P = 0.043). Although identical among both groups, in the week directly after each visit to the physician's office, adherence [71.4% (interquartile range 71-79%)] was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than that at the last 7 days prior to each visit [100% (interquartile range 90-100%)]. On the remaining days between the visits, patients from the self-pressure group displayed a modestly better adherence than patients from the office pressure group (97.6 vs. 97.0%; P = 0.024).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Although self-blood pressure measurement as an adjunct to office blood pressure measurement led to somewhat better adherence to treatment in this study, the difference was only small and not clinically significant. The time relative to a visit to the doctor seems to be a more important predictor of adherence.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of ezetimibe for Japanese patients with dyslipidaemia: The ESSENTIAL Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are insufficient data available on the efficacy and safety of lipid-lowering therapy for patients with dyslipidaemia complicated by multiple metabolic abnormalities.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe 10 mg/day administered to Japanese patients with dyslipidaemia.
AB  - METHODS: This was a prospective study carried out at Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan. In one group, ezetimibe 10 mg/day alone was given to 33 patients for 12 weeks. In the other two groups, ezetimibe was given with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) to 13 patients for 12 weeks: pravastatin 10 mg/day (n = 7) or rosuvastatin 2.5 mg/day (n = 6). The main outcome measure was the effect of ezetimibe on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other lipid levels from baseline to 12 weeks.
AB  - RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, all groups showed marked reductions in mean +/- SD LDL-C level (from 155.4 +/- 22.0 mg/dL at baseline to 118.0 +/- 28.1 mg/dL, i.e. -37.4 mg/dL; p < 0.001). The mean reduction in LDL-C level with ezetimibe monotherapy was significantly greater in patients with impaired LDL-C metabolism, glucose metabolism or hypertension than in those without such abnormalities (-21.0% vs -8.4%, p < 0.01; -22.7% vs -9.5%, p < 0.05; and -22.5% vs -5.9%, p < 0.05; respectively). The reduction in LDL-C levels with ezetimibe monotherapy was also correlated with the number of metabolic abnormalities (rho = 0.426, p = 0.013).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Both ezetimibe monotherapy and combination therapy with ezetimibe and a statin were able to safely and effectively control LDL-C levels in Japanese patients with dyslipidaemia, including those with metabolic abnormalities.

TI  - The devil is in the detail - a multifactorial intervention to reduce blood pressure in co-existing diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a single blind, randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: About 30-60% of individuals are non-adherent to their prescribed medications and this risk increases as the number of prescribed medications increases. This paper outlines the development of a consumer-centred Medicine Self-Management Intervention (MESMI), designed to improve blood pressure control and medication adherence in consumers with diabetes and chronic kidney disease recruited from specialist outpatients' clinics.
AB  - METHODS: We developed a multifactorial intervention consisting of Self Blood Pressure Monitoring (SBPM), medication review, a twenty-minute interactive Digital Versatile Disc (DVD), and follow-up support telephone calls to help consumers improve their blood pressure control and take their medications as prescribed. The intervention is novel in that it has been developed from analysis of consumer and health professional views, and includes consumer video exemplars in the DVD. The primary outcome measure was a drop of 3-6 mmHg systolic blood pressure at three months after completion of the intervention. Secondary outcome measures included: assessment of medication adherence, medication self-efficacy and general wellbeing. Consumers' adherence to their prescribed medications was measured by manual pill count, self-report of medication adherence, and surrogate biochemical markers of disease control.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The management of complex health problems is an increasing component of health care practice, and requires interventions that improve patient outcomes. We describe the preparatory work and baseline data of a single blind, randomized controlled trial involving consumers requiring cross-specialty care with a follow-up period extending to 12 months post-baseline.
AB  - TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ACTRN12607000044426).

TI  - Impact of a pharmaceutical care intervention on blood pressure control in a chain pharmacy practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects over 50 million Americans, with only 50% of patients being adequately controlled. Several pharmacist counseling and pharmacist-physician comanagement studies have documented that community pharmacist interventions improve blood pressure (BP) management.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether community pharmacists can improve clinical endpoints including hypertension control, drug therapy dosing, adherence to prescribed regimens, adverse drug reaction incidence, patient understanding, response to therapy, and quality-of-life.
AB  - METHODS: The program included the education and training of a group of 18 chain community pharmacists in hypertension therapies, monitoring, and management. Protocols and documentation tools were based on nationally accepted clinical practice guidelines for hypertension in place at the time of the study. Pharmaceutical care (PC) was then compared with usual care (UC) over a 12-month period.
AB  - RESULTS: The study initially enrolled 180 PC and 196 UC patients, with 44% (PC) and 32% (UC) of the patients reporting a final BP measurement. A larger proportion (50%) of PC patients who had poorly controlled hypertension at baseline (>140/90 mm Hg) were controlled compared with UC patients (22%). The average reduction in systolic BP was 9.9 mm Hg in PC patients compared with 2.8 mm Hg in UC patients (p < 0.05). Changes in diastolic BP were similar in the PC and UC groups. Based on patient self-report, PC patients were more likely to say that they take their medicines as prescribed compared with UC patients (p < 0.05). The 1- to 6-month antihypertensive adherence rate was higher in PC patients (0.91 +/- 0.15) compared to UC patients (0.78 +/- 0.30) (p = 0.02); there was no significant difference in adherence rate during the 7- to 12-month period.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Community pharmacists can positively affect patient medication adherence during the 6-month period following counseling by a pharmacist along with an improvement in patient BP. However, there is much room for improvement in PC programs and in the number of patients who properly adhere to their medications.

TI  - Amlodipine/Atorvastatin: a review of its use in the treatment of hypertension and dyslipidaemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. [Review] [92 refs]
AB  - Amlodipine/atorvastatin (Caduet) is a single-tablet, fixed-dose combination of the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist amlodipine and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin. The bioavailability of amlodipine and atorvastatin with a single-tablet, fixed-dose amlodipine/atorvastatin combination was not significantly different to that with coadministered separate amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets. In well controlled clinical trials in patients with hypertension and dyslipidaemia, once-daily amlodipine and atorvastatin (administered as the single-tablet, fixed-dose combination or coadministered as two separate tablets) effectively reduced systolic BP (SBP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and enabled more patients to achieve BP and LDL-C goals than single-agent or placebo therapy. There was no modification of the effect of amlodipine on SBP when administered in combination with atorvastatin and there was no modification of the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-C when administered in combination with amlodipine. In noncomparative, titration-to-goal, open-label 'real-world' trials, the single-tablet, fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/atorvastatin enabled patients with hypertension and dyslipidaemia to achieve both BP and LDL-C goals. Administration of a single tablet of amlodipine/atorvastatin, compared with coadministration of these agents as two separate tablets, improved patient adherence, according to a retrospective study that utilized prescription refill rates from a large US insurance database. Data from the large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ASCOT-LLA trial also demonstrated that the combination of amlodipine-based therapy and atorvastatin was effective in preventing cardiovascular (CV) endpoints in hypertensive patients at risk of CV disease (CVD). In summary, amlodipine/atorvastatin offers a convenient and effective approach to improving adherence and managing CV risk in hypertensive patients with dyslipidaemia or at risk of CVD.

TI  - Impact of adopting low sodium diet on biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A low sodium diet is an established intervention in the treatment of impaired renal function and hypertension which may modulate cardiovascular risk independent of recognised antihypertensive effects. Epidemiological data suggest that dietary sodium intake may be associated with systemic inflammation: another potential pathophysiological mechanism by which sodium intake may modify vascular disease.
AB  - METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that adopting a low sodium diet may decrease biomarkers of systemic inflammation or coagulation using data from a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants (n=171; aged 18-65 years) in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a low sodium diet for 6 weeks provided paired serum samples for analysis to assess the impact of adopting a low sodium diet on biomarkers of systemic inflammation and coagulation.
AB  - RESULTS: There was a significant difference in 24-hour sodium urinary excretion between the low sodium intake and the normal sodium intake groups of 43 mmol (p<0.001). In the primary analysis there was no effect of adopting a low sodium diet on serum D-dimers, but high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was reduced by 1.13 mg/L (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.03 to 2.22). However, after elimination of outlying high values for baseline serum hsCRP (>10 mg/L), this effect was attenuated (-0.47 mg/L; 95% CI, -1.25 to 0.31).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Using data from a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial in asthma with objective confirmation of adherence to the low sodium diet, we report that adopting a low sodium diet for 6 weeks has no effect on measures of systemic inflammation or coagulation.

TI  - The cost and effectiveness of adherence-improving interventions for antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs*. [Review]
AB  - AIMS: Adherence to cardiovascular medications is poor. Accordingly, interventions have been proposed to improve adherence. However, as intervention-associated costs are rarely considered in full, we sought to review the effectiveness and costs associated with different adherence-improving interventions for cardiovascular disease therapies.
AB  - METHODS: We reviewed MEDLINE to update a prior review of interventions to improve adherence with antihypertensive and/or lipid-lowering therapy covering January 1972 to June 2002, to add studies published from July 2002 to October 2007. Eligible studies evaluated > or = 1 intervention compared with a control, used measures other than self-report, reported significant improvement in adherence and followed patients for > or = 6 months. Effectiveness was measured as relative improvement (RI), the ratio of adherence in the intervention group to the control group. Costs were calculated based on those reported in the analysis, if available or estimated based on resource use described. All costs were truncated to 6 months and adjusted to 2007 US$.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 755 new articles, five met all eligibility criteria. Combining with the prior review gave 23 interventions from 18 studies. RI in adherence ranged from 1.11 to 4.65. Six-month intervention costs ranged from $10 to $142 per patient. Reminders had the lowest effectiveness (RI: 1.11-1.14), but were least costly ($10/6 months). Case management was most effective (RI: 1.23-4.65), but the most costly ($90-$130/6 months).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Generally, we found a positive association between intervention costs and effectiveness. Therefore, consideration of intervention costs, along with the benefits afforded to adherence, may help guide the design and implementation of adherence-improving programs.

TI  - Assessing medication adherence simultaneously by electronic monitoring and pill count in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to antihypertensive medication is one of the major problems in the treatment of hypertension. Electronic monitoring is currently considered to be the gold standard for assessing adherence, but it may trigger patients to open the pill bottle without taking medication or to take out more than prescribed. In adjunct to electronic monitoring, pill count could be a valuable tool for exploring adherence patterns, and their effects on blood pressure reduction.
AB  - METHODS: Among a total of 228 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, adherence to treatment was measured by means of both the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) and pill count. Patients were followed-up for seven visits over a period of 1 year. At each visit to the physician's office, patient's adherence was assessed by both methods.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence is defined as the percentage of days with correct dosing; median adherence according to MEMS was lower than median adherence according to pill count (91.6 vs. 96.1; P < 0.001). Both methods agreed in defining patients as adherent in 107 (47%) and nonadherent in 33 (14%) patients. Thirty-one (14%) patients were adherent only by MEMS and 59 (25%) patients only by pill count. At the end of the study, patients in the four categories reached comparable blood pressure values and reductions.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Pill count could be a useful adjunct to electronic monitoring in assessing adherence patterns. Although deviant intake behavior occurred frequently, the effect on achieved blood pressure and blood pressure reduction was not remarkable.

TI  - Effectiveness of a protocol-based strategy for achieving better blood pressure control in general practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There continues be a problem with the proportion of treated hypertension patients who are actually at recommended blood pressure targets.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Is an intensive protocol-based strategy for achieving blood pressure control effective in family practice and will family physicians and their hypertensive patients adhere to such a protocol.
AB  - METHODS: Design of the study is a cluster randomized controlled trial at the Centre for Studies in Primary Care, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario. Participants were 19 family physicians and 156 (98 intervention group and 58 control group) of their patients in and around the Kingston area. Patients were eligible if they had a diagnosis of hypertension and had not yet achieved their target blood pressure. Patients in the intervention group were managed according to a protocol that involved seeing their family doctor every 2 weeks over a 16-week period and having their antihypertensive medication regimen adjusted at each visit if target was not achieved. This was compared to usual care. Main outcomes were primary effectiveness outcome measured at 12 months was the differences in blood pressure between baseline and 12 months in the two groups. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included rates of achieving BP target and compliance with protocol by physicians and patients. Adherence outcomes were assessed by determining the number of visits made during the 16-week intervention period and the increase in the number of drugs being used.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the patients enrolled, 72 (74%) from the intervention group and 41 (71%) in the control group were available for analysis. Improvement between baseline and 12-month follow-up was significantly better for the intervention group than the control for diastolic mean daytime BP on 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (4.5 mmHg reduction versus 0.5 mmHg reduction) and for both systolic (14.7 mmHg reduction versus 2.7 mmHg reduction) and diastolic (7.4 mmHg reduction versus 0.6 mmHg increase) blood pressure on BpTRU. Of the 98 patients in the intervention, 80% attended four or more of the eight visits and 25% attended all eight visits; physicians increased the number or dosage of drugs the patient was taking in 52% of the visits. Conclusions. An intensive, protocol-based, management approach to achieving blood pressure control in hypertensive patients in family practice is effective and works even when there is flexibility built into the algorithm to allow family physicians to use their judgement in individual patients.

TI  - Maintenance of blood-pressure-lowering effect following a missed dose of aliskiren, irbesartan or ramipril: results of a randomized, double-blind study.
AB  - Most patients inadvertently miss an occasional dose of antihypertensive therapy, and hence drugs that provide sustained blood-pressure (BP) reduction beyond the 24-h dosing interval are desirable. The primary objective of this study was to compare the 24-h mean ambulatory BP reductions from baseline after a simulated missed dose of the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren, irbesartan or ramipril. In this double-blind study, 654 hypertensive patients (24-h mean ambulatory diastolic BP (MADBP) >or=85 mm Hg) were randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily aliskiren 150 mg, irbesartan 150 mg or ramipril 5 mg. Doses were doubled after 2 weeks. At day 42, patients were again randomized equally within each group to receive 1 day of placebo ('missed dose') on either day 42 or day 49. Patients with a successful 24-h ambulatory BP measurement at baseline and on day 42/49 were included in the analyses. The 24-h mean ambulatory systolic BP (MASBP)/MADBP reductions from baseline after a missed dose of aliskiren 300 mg (9.3/7.0 mm Hg) were similar to irbesartan 300 mg (9.5/7.3 mm Hg) and significantly larger than ramipril 10 mg (7.1/5.0 mm Hg, P<or=0.008). Loss of BP-lowering effect with aliskiren in the 24 h after a missed dose (1.0/0.7 mm Hg for 24-48-h vs 0-24-h MASBP/MADBP) was significantly lower than with irbesartan (3.6/2.2 mm Hg, P<0.01) or ramipril (4.0/2.6, P<0.0001). This equates to maintenance of 91/91% of the MASBP/MADBP-lowering effect with aliskiren, greater than irbesartan (73/77%) or ramipril (64/65%). The incidence of adverse events was similar across treatments (32.9-36.0%), although ramipril treatment was associated with an increased incidence of cough (ramipril, 6.1%; aliskiren, 0.5%; irbesartan, 1.8%). Aliskiren 300 mg provided a sustained BP-lowering effect beyond the 24-h dosing interval, with a significantly smaller loss of BP-lowering effect in the 24-48 h period after dose than irbesartan 300 mg or ramipril 10 mg.

TI  - The impact of an electronic monitoring and reminder device on patient compliance with antihypertensive therapy: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: High blood pressure (BP) significantly increases overall cardiovascular risk, the incidence of ischemic heart disease and stroke. One of the most important causes of insufficient BP control is low treatment compliance. Reminders and electronic compliance monitoring have been shown to be effective in improving patient compliance to some extent, but the combined effect has not been documented.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of an electronic reminder and monitoring device on patient compliance and BP control.
AB  - METHODS: All patients received medical treatment with telmisartan once daily and were randomized to either electronic compliance monitoring with a reminder and monitoring device or standard therapy for 6 months. Both groups were crossed over after 6 months. Intervention effectiveness was assessed using self-reported compliance and BP.
AB  - RESULTS: Data from 398 patients were analysed. In the first half of the study, patients using the device reported 91% compliance versus 85% in the control group. This difference diminished after crossover (88 versus 86%). BP was not affected. Electronic monitoring data on compliance revealed taking, dosing and timing compliance between 45 and 52% in study group 1, and between 32 and 38% in study group 2.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The Helping Hand reminder device was most suitable if used for newly diagnosed hypertensive patients, when it improved compliance by 6%. With the present medical treatment, the device does not have any influence on BP control, but with less forgiving medications, the device might make a significant difference. The use of the device can be an easy and effective way to improve compliance in selected patients.

TI  - Are co-morbidities associated with guideline adherence? The MI-Plus study of Medicare patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The impact of co-morbid illnesses on adherence to guideline recommendations in chronic illness is of growing concern. We tested a framework [Piette and Kerr, Diabetes Care. 29(3):725-31, 2006] of provider adherence to guidelines in the presence of co-morbid conditions, which suggests that the effect of co-morbid conditions depends on treatment recommendations for the co-morbid conditions and how symptomatic they are.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted an exploratory analysis to assess the framework using chart audit data for 1,240 post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Medicare beneficiaries in Alabama. We assessed level of guideline-adherent post-AMI care from chart-based quality indicators and constructed scores reflecting how much care for the co-morbid condition was similar to post-AMI care (concordance) and how symptomatic the co-morbid condition is, based on expert opinion.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 74 years, mean co-morbidities of 2, and 61% were white. Both concordance and symptomatic scores were positively associated with guideline compliance, with correlations of 0.32 and 0.14, respectively (p < 0.001 for each). We found positive correlations between highly concordant co-morbid conditions and post-AMI quality scores and negative correlations between highly symptomatic conditions and post-AMI quality scores; both findings support the framework. However, the framework performed less well for conditions that were not highly concordant or highly symptomatic, and the magnitudes of the associations were not large.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The framework was related to the association of co-morbid conditions with adherence by providers to guideline-recommended treatment for post-AMI patients. The framework holds promise for evaluating and possibly predicting guideline adherence.

TI  - Predictors of medication adherence for African American patients diagnosed with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence, morbidity and mortality of hypertension are strikingly higher for African Americans than for Whites. Poor adherence to the antihypertensive medication regimen is a major cause of inadequate blood pressure control. In this study, we assess the relationship of antihypertensive medication adherence to sociodemographic, clinical and cognitive characteristics of urban African American adults.
AB  - METHOD: Data were drawn from a larger randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of a behavioral intervention to improve medication adherence and blood pressure control among hypertensive African American patients followed in an urban primary care network. Medication adherence was assessed at baseline using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS)--a method regarded as the gold standard for assessing medication adherence in clinical research. Information on potential correlates of medication adherence (sociodemographic, clinical and cognitive) was obtained at baseline by computer-assisted interview. We assessed the cross sectional association of these factors to medication adherence in baseline data.
AB  - RESULTS: Medication adherence was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure (r=.253, P<.04) and self-reported medication adherence (r=.285, P<.03). The relationship of education to medication adherence varied significantly by sex (P<.05 for interaction). Specifically, lower educational attainment was related to higher adherence among men, but lower adherence among women.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Identifying correlates of low antihypertensive medication adherence and their interactions, as in this study, will help health providers to better recognize patients at higher risk for worse hypertension-related outcomes. This knowledge can also inform interventions which target a higher-risk subset of hypertensive patients.

TI  - The association of patient-physician gender concordance with cardiovascular disease risk factor control and treatment in diabetes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gender concordance between patients and their physicians is related to prevention screening and other quality indicators. Research suggests female physicians may place greater emphasis on preventive care than male physicians; however, little is known about whether physician gender and patient-physician gender concordance are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor levels and treatment. Our objective was to examine associations between patient gender, physician gender, and their interaction with CVD risk factor control, medication adherence, and treatment intensification in diabetes.
AB  - METHODS: In this study, 157,458 Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult diabetes patients with a primary care physician (PCP) were assessed for above target levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (>or=8%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (>or=100 mg/dL), and systolic blood pressure (SBP>or=130 mm Hg) in 2005. Medication adherence and appropriate CVD treatment intensification were assessed using pharmacy data. Probit models assessed the adjusted marginal effects of patient gender, PCP gender, and their interaction on control, adherence, and intensification.
AB  - RESULTS: Female patients had lower adjusted rates of LDL-C (46% vs. 55%, p<0.001) and SBP control (52% vs. 60%, p<0.001) than males. Female patients of female PCPs had the highest adjusted rates of HbA1c control of the four patient-physician gender dyads (70% vs. 66%-68%, p<0.05). Male patients were more likely than female patients to receive treatment intensification for high SBP (60% vs. 57%, p<0.001). Female PCPs were more likely than their male counterparts to intensify therapy for hyperlipidemia and hypertension.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patient and physician gender and gender concordance are modestly associated with CVD risk factor control and treatment in diabetes. Further understanding of these differences could lead to improved CVD outcomes for women.

TI  - Quality improvement initiatives improve hypertension care among veterans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We implemented a quality improvement initiative to improve hypertension care at Veterans Affairs-Tennessee Valley Healthcare System.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We implemented multiple interventions among 2 teaching hospitals, 5 community-based outpatient clinics, and 4 contract clinic sites. Goals of the program were to (1) improve measurement and documentation of blood pressure (BP), (2) initiate outpatient patient education, (3) emphasize VA/Department of Defense hypertension treatment algorithms to providers, (4) emphasize external peer review program performance goals, and (5) initiate feedback of each clinic's performance. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients seen each week with a diagnosis of hypertension who had their last available BP in control (< or =140/90 mm Hg). Observation time was 40 weeks (14 weeks preintervention, 8 weeks intervention implementation, and 18 weeks postintervention), during which there were 55 586 unique clinic visits for hypertension. After intervention deployment, there was an absolute improvement of 4.2% in BP control (preintervention 61.5% [12 245/19 908] versus postintervention 65.7% [15 809/24 059], P<0.0001). Teaching hospital A had an absolute improvement of 1.4% (63.4% [3544/5591] versus 64.8% [4581/7073], P=0.108). Teaching hospital B showed a 0.8% absolute improvement in BP control (59.7% [2577/4315] versus 60.5% [3416/5650], P=0.456). The community-based outpatient clinics had a combined absolute improvement of 8.6% (60.2% [5252/8728] versus 68.8% [6895/10025], P<0.0001). The contract clinics had a combined improvement of 1.5% (68.4% [872/1274] versus 69.9% [917/1311], P=0.409). Results were sustained 1 year after intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: After implementing small, focused, and inexpensive interventions, BP control improved 4.2%, thereby improving the quality of hypertension care.

TI  - Hypertension telemanagement in blacks.
AB  - We propose evaluation of a multi-component home automated telemanagement system providing integrated support to both clinicians and patients in implementing hypertension treatment guidelines. In a randomized clinical study, 550 blacks with hypertension are followed for 18 months. The major components of the intervention and control groups are identical and are based on the current standard of care. For the purpose of this study, we define "standard of care" as the expected evidence-based care provided according to the current hypertension treatment guidelines. Although intervention and control groups are similar in terms of their care components, they differ in the mode of care delivery. For the control group the best attempt is made to deliver all components of a guideline-concordant care in a routine clinical environment whereas for the intervention group the routine clinical environment is enhanced with health information technology that assists clinicians and patients in working together in implementing treatment guidelines. The home automated telemanagement system guides patients in following their individualized treatment plans and helps care coordination team in monitoring the patient progress. The study design is aimed at addressing the main question of this trial: whether the addition of the information technology-enhanced care coordination in the routine primary care setting can improve delivery of evidence-based hypertension care in blacks. The outcome parameters include quality of life, medical care use, treatment compliance, psychosocial variables, and improvement in blood pressure control rates. The trial will provide insight on the potential impact of information technology-enhanced care coordination in blacks with poorly controlled hypertension.

TI  - The Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) trial: pharmacy interventions to improve hypertension control in blacks.
AB  - Recent studies suggest that involving pharmacists is an effective strategy for improving patient adherence and blood pressure (BP) control. To date, few controlled studies have tested the cost-effectiveness of specific models for improving patient adherence and BP control in community pharmacies, where most Americans obtain prescriptions. We hypothesized that a team model of adherence monitoring and intervention in corporately owned community pharmacies can improve patient adherence, prescribing, and BP control among hypertensive black patients. The Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) Trial is a randomized controlled trial testing a multistep intervention for improving adherence monitoring and intervention in 28 corporately owned community pharmacies. Patients in the 14 control pharmacies received "usual care," and patients in the 14 intervention pharmacies received TEAM Care by trained pharmacists and pharmacy technicians working with patients and physicians. Data collectors screened 1250 patients and enrolled 597 hypertensive black patients. The primary end points were the proportion of patients achieving BP control and reductions in systolic and diastolic BP measured after 6 and 12 months. Secondary end points were changes in adherence monitoring and intervention, patient adherence and barriers to adherence, prescribing, and cost-effectiveness. Researchers also will examine potential covariates and barriers to change. Involving pharmacists is a potentially powerful means of improving BP control in blacks. Pharmacists are in an excellent position to monitor patients between clinic visits and to provide useful information to patients and physicians.

TI  - Does reducing physician uncertainty improve hypertension control?: rationale and methods.
AB  - Hypertension affects nearly one third of the US population overall, and the prevalence rises sharply with age. In spite of public educational campaigns and professional education programs to encourage blood pressure measurement and control of both systolic and diastolic control to <140/90 mm Hg (or 130/80 mm Hg if diabetic), 43% of treated hypertensives do not achieve the recommended Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure target. Among blacks, 48% are uncontrolled on treatment. The majority of persons classified as poorly controlled hypertensives have mild systolic blood pressure elevation (in the range of 140 to 160 mm Hg). We hypothesized that physician uncertainty regarding the patient's usual blood pressure, as well as uncertainty regarding the extent of medication nonadherence, represent an important barrier to further reductions in the proportion of uncontrolled hypertensives in the United States. Using cluster randomization, 10 primary care clinics (6 from a public health care system and 4 from a private clinic system) were randomized to either the uncertainty reduction intervention condition or to usual care. An average of 68 patients per clinic were recruited to serve as units of observation. Physicians in the 5 intervention clinics were provided with a specially designed study form that included a graph of recent blood pressure measurements in their study patients, a check box to indicate their assessment of the adequacy of the patient's blood pressure control, and a menu of services they could order to aid in patient management. These menu options included 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; electronic bottle cap assessment of medication adherence, followed by medication adherence counseling in patients found to be nonadherent; and lifestyle assessment and counseling followed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Physicians in the 5 usual practice clinics did not have access to these services but were informed of which patients had been enrolled in the study. Substudies carried out to further characterize the study population and interpret intervention results included ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and electronic bottle cap monitoring in a random subsample of patients at baseline, and audio recording of patient-physician encounters after intervention implementation. The primary study end point was defined as the proportion of patients with controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg or <130/80 mm Hg if diabetic). Secondary end points include actual measured clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, patient physician communication patterns, physician prescribing patient self-reported lifestyle and medication adherence, physician knowledge, attitude and beliefs regarding the utility of intervention tools to achieve blood pressure control, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Six-hundred eighty patients have been randomized, and 675 remain in active follow-up after 1.5 years. Patient closeout will be complete in March 2009. Analyses of the baseline data are in progress. Office-based blood pressure measurement error and bias, as well as physician and patient beliefs about the need for treatment intensification, may be important factors that limit further progress in blood pressure control. This trial will provide data on the extent to which available technologies not widely used in primary care will change physician prescribing behavior and patient adherence to prescribed treatment.

TI  - Home-based blood pressure interventions for blacks.
AB  - Efforts to increase blood pressure (BP) control rates in blacks, a traditionally underserved high-risk population must address both provider practice and patient adherence issues. The home-based BP Intervention for blacks study is a 3-arm randomized controlled trial designed to test 2 strategies to improve hypertension management and outcomes in a decentralized service setting serving a vulnerable and complex home care population. The primary study outcomes are systolic BP, diastolic BP, and BP control; secondary outcomes are nurse adherence to hypertension management recommendations and patient adherence to medication, healthy diet, and other self-management strategies. Nurses (n=312) in a nonprofit Medicare-certified home health agency are randomized along with their eligible hypertensive patients (n=845). The 2 interventions being tested are (1) a "basic" intervention delivering key evidence-based reminders to home care nurses and patients while the patient is receiving traditional postacute home health care; and (2) an "augmented" intervention that includes that same as the basic intervention, plus transition to an ongoing Hypertension Home Support Program that extends support for 12 months. Outcomes are measured at 3 and 12 months after baseline interview. The interventions will be assessed relative to usual care and to each other. Systems change to improve BP management and outcomes in home health will not easily occur without new intervention models and rigorous evaluation of their impact. Results from this trial will provide important information on potential strategies to improve BP control in a low-income chronically ill patient population.

TI  - The impact of a multidisciplinary information technology-supported program on blood pressure control in primary care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a leading mortality risk factor yet inadequately controlled in most affected subjects. Effective programs to address this problem are lacking. We hypothesized that an information technology-supported management program could help improve blood pressure (BP) control.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: This randomized controlled trial included 223 primary care hypertensive subjects with mean 24-hour BP >130/80 and daytime BP >135/85 mm Hg measured with ambulatory monitoring (ABPM). Intervention subjects received a BP monitor and access to an information technology-supported adherence and BP monitoring system providing nurses, pharmacists, and physicians with monthly reports. Control subjects received usual care. The mean (+/-SD) follow-up was 348 (+/-78) and 349 (+/-84) days in the intervention and control group, respectively. The primary end point of the change in the mean 24-hour ambulatory BP was consistently greater in intervention subjects for both systolic (-11.9 versus -7.1 mm Hg; P<0.001) and diastolic BP (-6.6 versus -4.5 mm Hg; P=0.007). The proportion of subjects that achieved Canadian Guideline target BP (46.0% versus 28.6%) was also greater in the intervention group (P=0.006). We observed similar BP declines for ABPM and self-recorded home BP suggesting the latter could be an alternative for confirming BP control. The intervention was associated with more physician-driven antihypertensive dose adjustments or changes in agents (P=0.03), more antihypertensive classes at study end (P=0.007), and a trend toward improved adherence measured by prescription refills (P=0.07).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This multidisciplinary information technology-supported program that provided feedback to patients and healthcare providers significantly improved blood pressure levels in a primary care setting.

TI  - The effectiveness of health coaching, home blood pressure monitoring, and home-titration in controlling hypertension among low-income patients: protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the many antihypertensive medications available, two-thirds of patients with hypertension do not achieve blood pressure control. This is thought to be due to a combination of poor patient education, poor medication adherence, and "clinical inertia." The present trial evaluates an intervention consisting of health coaching, home blood pressure monitoring, and home medication titration as a method to address these three causes of poor hypertension control.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The randomized controlled trial will include 300 patients with poorly controlled hypertension. Participants will be recruited from a primary care clinic in a teaching hospital that primarily serves low-income populations.An intervention group of 150 participants will receive health coaching, home blood pressure monitoring, and home-titration of antihypertensive medications during 6 months. The control group (n=150) will receive health coaching plus home blood pressure monitoring for the same duration. A passive control group will receive usual care. Blood pressure measurements will take place at baseline, and after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome will be change in systolic blood pressure after 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes measured will be change in diastolic blood pressure, adverse events, and patient and provider satisfaction.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The present study is designed to assess whether the 3-pronged approach of health coaching, home blood pressure monitoring, and home medication titration can successfully improve blood pressure, and if so, whether this effect persists beyond the period of the intervention.

TI  - Effect of antihypertensive medication adherence among employees with hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine if antihypertensive medication adherence is associated with decreased medical and drug costs, medical service utilization, and work absence days.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database study using medical, pharmacy, sick leave, short-term and long-term disability, and workers' compensation claims data from multiple large US employers from 2001 to 2008.
AB  - METHODS: We used medical and pharmacy claims to identify employees with hypertension. The index date was the date of the first hypertension-related pharmacy claim. Eligible employees had health plan enrollment 6 months before the index date and at least 12 months after the index date. Employees younger than 45 years were excluded from the study. Regression models estimated the effect of the proportion of days covered (PDC) by hypertension medication on outcomes after the index date, including health benefit costs, medical service utilization, and work absence days, as well as some clinical outcomes calculated separately for high-prior-cost and low-prior-cost employees. High-prior-cost employees were those who accounted for the top 60.0% of total medical costs during the 6 months before the index date. The regression models controlled for demographics, job-related variables, and comorbidities.
AB  - RESULTS: Among low-prior-cost employees, high PDC was associated with increased medical and drug costs and work absence days. Among high-prior-cost employees, high PDC was associated with decreased medical and drug costs, fewer work absence days and inpatient hospital days, and increased hypertension-specific medical costs.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Antihypertensive medication adherence was associated with improvement in some short-term utilization measures among high-prior-cost employees, but significant short-term improvement was not seen among low-prior-cost employees.

TI  - Significance of initial blood pressure and comorbidity for the efficacy of a fixed combination of an angiotensin receptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide in clinical practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two-thirds of all patients with arterial hypertension need drug combinations to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals. Fixed combinations have high efficacy and result in high patient compliance. 300 mg irbesartan plus 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) has been investigated only in clinical trials but not in daily practice.
AB  - METHODS: A multicenter, noninterventional, noncontrolled observational study with 8123 patients seen by 1604 physicians in daily practice. BP reduction (office measurements), co-morbid disease and tolerability were documented over a 6-month observational period.
AB  - RESULTS: At mean baseline BP of 161 +/- 15/94 +/- 10 mmHg, administering of fixed combination resulted in a substantial BP reduction averaging 28 +/- 15/14 +/- 10 mmHg (P < 0.001). Decrease of systolic BP ran parallel with increasing systolic baseline BP (Spearman's Rho -0.731; P < 0.0001; diastolic BP vs diastolic baseline BP Rho 0.740; P < 0.0001), independent from patient characteristics (age, obesity, diabetes or nephropathy) but enhanced with short history of hypertension (P < 0.0001 vs long history), prior beta blockers (P = 0.001 vs prior angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), prior calcium channel blockers (P = 0.046 vs prior ARBs) and no prior medication (P = 0.012 vs prior ARBs). High compliance (>98%) and low incidence of adverse events (0.66%) were documented.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The fixed combination of 300 mg irbesartan with 25 mg HCTZ was efficacious and tolerable in an unselected patient population in primary care.

TI  - The effect of an educational intervention on patients' knowledge about hypertension, beliefs about medicines, and adherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases continues to rise in South Africa, leading to high rates of morbidity and mortality. The control of hypertension is far from optimal because of factors such as inadequate patient understanding of the condition and its therapy, as well as poor adherence to prescribed regimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of an educational intervention on selected hypertensive participants' levels of knowledge about hypertension, their beliefs about medicines, and adherence to antihypertensive therapy.
AB  - METHOD: Participants took part in an educational intervention that provided them with information about hypertension and its therapy through presentations, monthly meetings, and a summary information leaflet. The participants' levels of knowledge about hypertension and its therapy as well as their beliefs about medicines were measured using interviews and/or self-administered questionnaires. Levels of adherence were assessed using pill counts, self-reports, and punctuality in collecting medication refills. Paired t tests for dependent samples were performed to compare the participants' levels of knowledge about hypertension and its therapy, beliefs about medicines, and levels of adherence to antihypertensive therapy before and after the educational intervention.
AB  - RESULTS: There were significant increases in the participants' levels of knowledge about hypertension and its therapy (P<.0001). Most of the parameters used to indicate beliefs about medicines were significantly modified in a positive manner (P<.01 for concerns about medicines, P<.01 for beliefs about the harmful nature of medicines, and P<.01 for the necessity-concerns differential).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Results of this study show that the educational intervention led to an increase in the participants' levels of knowledge about hypertension and a positive influence on their beliefs about medicines. Despite these positive changes, adequate time is required before anticipated behavioral changes, such as increased adherence, can be observed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In previous analyses in ALLHAT, blacks had a significantly lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the pravastatin group compared to the usual care group, whereas non-blacks had no benefit from pravastatin. No previous statin trial has reported results separately in blacks.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine if apparent racial differences in CHD in ALLHAT are explained by differences in baseline characteristics, adherence during the trial, or achieved blood pressure and lipid lowering.
AB  - METHODS: This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Hypertensive, moderately hypercholesterolemic participants were assigned to open-label pravastatin (40 mg/d) or usual care. The outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. We performed intention-to-treat survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for baseline covariates (age, sex, aspirin use, history of CHD and diabetes, and baseline hypertension treatment) and time-varying levels of blood pressure and total cholesterol.
AB  - RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline characteristics, there remained a significant interaction between race and treatment group (P = .02). In stratified models, blacks in the pravastatin group had a 29% lower risk of CHD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.90, P = .005) compared to those in the usual care group, whereas non-blacks had no benefit (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85-1.19, P = .95). With further adjustment for achieved blood pressure and total cholesterol, the HR in blacks was 0.65 (95% CI 0.45-0.96, P = .03) and in non-blacks was 1.07 (95% CI 0.81-1.41, P = .65).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pravastatin is effective in preventing CHD in blacks.

TI  - Valsartan plus hydrochlorothiazide for first-line therapy in hypertension. [Review] [57 refs]
AB  - Goal blood pressure levels are only being achieved in approximately a third of hypertensive patients, which suggests that there is a need for new and/or improved approaches to the treatment of hypertension. The majority of patients with hypertension require combination therapy to control their blood pressure. The use of a combination of drugs with complementary mechanisms of action may provide greater efficacy and tolerability compared with monotherapy, and may allow more rapid achievement of target blood pressure. Moreover, the use of single-pill combinations has the potential to increase adherence and persistence, and reduce costs. The single-pill combination of valsartan plus hydrochlorothiazide was recently approved by the US FDA for first-line use in hypertensive patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals. The focus of this article is on those randomized, double-blind trials in which this combination was administered as first-line therapy in patients with essential hypertension. [References: 57]

TI  - Effects of audio relaxation programs for blood pressure reduction in older adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress management is one element of the lifestyle modification that is recommended for blood pressure control. Reduction in sympathetic arousal may be achieved through a series of audio relaxation training.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of two audio relaxation programs for blood pressure reduction in older adults.
AB  - METHODS: This clinical randomized study consists of 12-sessions of intervention, with one-month and three-month follow up measures. 41 older adults were randomly assigned to either listening to a 12-minute audio relaxation program or a 12-minute Mozart andante. At each session, blood pressures were recorded.
AB  - RESULTS: For both groups, the reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures after the 12-session intervention training was statistically and clinically significant. The reduction in systolic blood pressure was greater in the audio relaxation group than the Mozart group. The adherence to the program at one-month and three-month was 54% and 66% respectively. The blood pressure at one-month and three-month were not significantly different than the initial measurement.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Significant blood pressure reduction can be achieved through a brief 12-minute audio relaxation program with older adults. Guided relaxation may be more effective in lowering blood pressure than plain music.

TI  - Physician and pharmacist collaboration to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated that blood pressure (BP) control can be improved when clinical pharmacists assist with patient management. The objective of this study was to evaluate if a physician and pharmacist collaborative model in community-based medical offices could improve BP control.
AB  - METHODS: This was a prospective, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial with clinics randomized to a control group (n = 3) or to an intervention group (n = 3). The study enrolled 402 patients (mean age, 58.3 years) with uncontrolled hypertension. Clinical pharmacists made drug therapy recommendations to physicians based on national guidelines. Research nurses performed BP measurements and 24-hour BP monitoring.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean (SD) guideline adherence scores increased from 49.4 (19.3) at baseline to 53.4 (18.1) at 6 months (8.1% increase) in the control group and from 40.4 (22.6) at baseline to 62.8 (13.5) at 6 months (55.4% increase) in the intervention group (P = .09 for adjusted between-group comparison). The mean BP decreased 6.8/4.5 mm Hg in the control group and 20.7/9.7 mm Hg in the intervention group (P < .05 for between-group systolic BP comparison). The adjusted difference in systolic BP was -12.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], -24.0 to 0.0) mm Hg, while the adjusted difference in diastolic BP was -1.8 (95% CI, -11.9 to 8.3) mm Hg. The 24-hour BP levels showed similar effect sizes. Blood pressure was controlled in 29.9% of patients in the control group and in 63.9% of patients in the intervention group (adjusted odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.0-5.1; P < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A physician and pharmacist collaborative intervention achieved significantly better mean BP and overall BP control rates compared with a control group. Additional research should be conducted to evaluate efficient strategies to implement team-based chronic disease management.

TI  - Another look at the results of the JUPITER trial.
AB  - Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) was a placebo-controlled trial undertaken on "apparently healthy" subjects selected primarily on the basis of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations >or=2.0 mg/L. JUPITER showed that rosuvastatin reduced the incidence of cardiac events compared to a control group. The study population (median age 66 years) included men and women with the metabolic syndrome (about 41%), median blood pressures in the prehypertensive range, current smoking (about 15%), median body mass indexes higher than normal, and Framingham 10-year risk >10% (about 50%). The presence of these risk factors indicates that a significant proportion of subjects were not "healthy" and warranted aggressive management under current guidelines, without the measurement of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Furthermore, <17% of the trial participants were taking guidelines-recommended aspirin, and 25% had systolic blood pressures >145 mm Hg and would have merited treatment for hypertension. It is likely that many of the participants did not receive care consistent with current standards. Thus, the benefit of statin therapy would have been more difficult to demonstrate if standard therapeutic recommendations had been followed. In conclusion, these considerations cast doubt on the contention that statin therapy should be initiated in apparently healthy individuals on the basis of elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.

TI  - Current blood pressure self-management: a qualitative study.
AB  - Blood pressure (BP) self-management is advocated to manage hypertension and reduce the risk of a future stroke. The purpose of this study was to identify BP self-management strategies used by individuals who had sustained a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). As part of a mixed-methods study, we conducted six focus groups and achieved saturation with 16 stroke survivors and 12 TIA survivors. Each participant completed a questionnaire regarding current BP management. We analyzed and coded qualitative transcripts from the focus groups and found four emergent themes that were supported by questionnaire results. The four self-management themes include: (1) external support for BP self-management is helpful; (2) BP self-management strategies include medication adherence, routine development, and BP monitoring; (3) BP risk factor management involves diet, exercise, and stress reduction; and (4) taking advantage of the"teachable moment" may be advantageous for behavior change to self-manage BP. This research provides key elements for the development of a successful BP self-management program.

TI  - Influence of patient race on physician prescribing decisions: a randomized on-line experiment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior research reports black patients have lower medication use for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patient race influences physicians' prescribing.
AB  - DESIGN: Web-based survey including three clinical vignettes (hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes), with patient race (black, white) randomized across vignettes.
AB  - SUBJECTS: A total of 716 respondents from 5,141 eligible sampled primary care physicians (14% response rate).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: None
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Medication recommendation (any medication vs none, on-patent branded vs generic, and therapeutic class) and physicians' treatment adherence forecast (10-point Likert scale, 1-definitely not adhere, 10-definitely adhere).
AB  - RESULTS: Respondents randomized to view black patients (n = 371) and white patients (n = 345) recommend any medications at comparable rates for hypercholesterolemia (100.0% white vs 99.5% black, P = 0.50), hypertension (99.7% white vs 99.5% black, P = 1.00), and diabetes (99.7% white vs 99.7% black, P = 1.00). Patient race influenced medication class chosen in the hypertension vignette; respondents randomized to view black patients recommended calcium channel blockers more often (20.8% black vs 3.2% white) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors less often (47.4% black vs 62.6% white) (P < 0.001). Patient race did not influence medication class for hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Respondents randomized to view black patients reported lower forecasted patient adherence for hypertension (P < 0.001, mean: 7.3 black vs 7.7 white) and diabetes (P = 0.05 mean: 7.4 black vs 7.6 white), but race had no meaningful influence on forecasted adherence for hypercholesterolemia (P = 0.15, mean: 7.2 black vs 7.3 white).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Racial differences in outpatient prescribing patterns for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes are likely attributable to factors other than prescribing decisions based on patient race.

TI  - A cluster-randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of culturally-appropriate hypertension education among Afro-Surinamese and Ghanaian patients in Dutch general practice: study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals of African descent living in western countries have increased rates of hypertension and hypertension-related complications. Poor adherence to hypertension treatment (medication and lifestyle changes) has been identified as one of the most important modifiable causes for the observed disparities in hypertension related complications, with patient education being recommended to improve adherence. Despite evidence that culturally-appropriate patient education may improve the overall quality of care for ethnic minority patients, few studies have focused on how hypertensive individuals of African descent respond to this approach. This paper describes the design of a study that compares the effectiveness of culturally-appropriate hypertension education with that of the standard approach among Surinamese and Ghanaian hypertensive patients with an elevated blood pressure in Dutch primary care practices.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster-randomized controlled trial will be conducted in four primary care practices in Amsterdam, all offering hypertension care according to Dutch clinical guidelines. After randomization, patients in the usual care sites (n = 2) will receive standard hypertension education. Patients in the intervention sites (n = 2) will receive three culturally-appropriate hypertension education sessions, culturally-specific educational materials and targeted lifestyle support. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with a reduction in systolic blood pressure >or= 10 mmHg at eight months after the start of the trial. The secondary outcomes will be the proportion of patients with self-reported adherence to (i) medication and (ii) lifestyle recommendations at eight months after the start of the trial. The study will enrol 148 patients (74 per condition, 37 per site). Eligibility criteria for patients of either sex will be: current diagnosis of hypertension, self-identified Afro-Surinamese or Ghanaian, >or= 20 years, and baseline blood pressure >or= 140/90 mmHg. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 3 1/2, 6 1/2, and eight months. Other measurements will be performed at baseline and eight months.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The findings will provide new knowledge on how to improve blood pressure control and patient adherence in ethnic minority persons with a high risk of negative hypertension-related health outcomes.

TI  - Constructing common cohorts from trials with overlapping eligibility criteria: implications for comparing effect sizes between trials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparing findings from separate trials is necessary to choose among treatment options, however differences among study cohorts may impede these comparisons.
AB  - PURPOSE: As a case study, to examine the overlap of study cohorts in two large randomized controlled clinical trials that assess interventions to reduce risk of major cardiovascular disease events in adults with type 2 diabetes in order to explore the feasibility of cross-trial comparisons
AB  - METHODS: The Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) and The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trials enrolled 5145 and 10,251 adults with type 2 diabetes, respectively. Look AHEAD assesses the efficacy of an intensive lifestyle intervention designed to produce weight loss; ACCORD tests pharmacological therapies for control of glycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Incidence of major cardiovascular disease events is the primary outcome for both trials. A sample was constructed to include participants from each trial who appeared to meet eligibility criteria and be appropriate candidates for the other trial's interventions. Demographic characteristics, health status, and outcomes of members and nonmembers of this constructed sample were compared.
AB  - RESULTS: Nearly 80% of Look AHEAD participants were projected to be ineligible for ACCORD; ineligibility was primarily due to better glycemic control or no early history of cardiovascular disease. Approximately 30% of ACCORD participants were projected to be ineligible for Look AHEAD, often for reasons linked to poorer health. The characteristics of participants projected to be jointly eligible for both trials continued to reflect differences between trials according to factors likely linked to retention, adherence, and study outcomes.
AB  - LIMITATIONS: Accurate ascertainment of cross-trial eligibility was hampered by differences between protocols.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Despite several similarities, the Look AHEAD and ACCORD cohorts represent distinct populations. Even within the subsets of participants who appear to be eligible and appropriate candidates for trials of both modes of intervention, differences remained. Direct comparisons of results from separate trials of lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions are compromised by marked differences in enrolled cohorts.

TI  - Short-term modified alternate-day fasting: a novel dietary strategy for weight loss and cardioprotection in obese adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability of modified alternate-day fasting (ADF; ie, consuming 25% of energy needs on the fast day and ad libitum food intake on the following day) to facilitate weight loss and lower vascular disease risk in obese individuals remains unknown.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of ADF that is administered under controlled compared with self-implemented conditions on body weight and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk indicators in obese adults.
AB  - DESIGN: Sixteen obese subjects (12 women, 4 men) completed a 10-wk trial, which consisted of 3 phases: 1) a 2-wk control phase, 2) a 4-wk weight loss/ADF controlled food intake phase, and 3) a 4-wk weight loss/ADF self-selected food intake phase.
AB  - RESULTS: Dietary adherence remained high throughout the controlled food intake phase (days adherent: 86%) and the self-selected food intake phase (days adherent: 89%). The rate of weight loss remained constant during controlled food intake (0.67 +/- 0.1 kg/wk) and self-selected food intake phases (0.68 +/- 0.1 kg/wk). Body weight decreased (P < 0.001) by 5.6 +/- 1.0 kg (5.8 +/- 1.1%) after 8 wk of diet. Percentage body fat decreased (P < 0.01) from 45 +/- 2% to 42 +/- 2%. Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerol concentrations decreased (P < 0.01) by 21 +/- 4%, 25 +/- 10%, and 32 +/- 6%, respectively, after 8 wk of ADF, whereas HDL cholesterol remained unchanged. Systolic blood pressure decreased (P < 0.05) from 124 +/- 5 to 116 +/- 3 mm Hg.
AB  - CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ADF is a viable diet option to help obese individuals lose weight and decrease CAD risk. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as UIC-004-2009.

TI  - Perceived susceptibility to chronic kidney disease among high-risk patients seen in primary care practices.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients' views of their risk for the development or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are poorly characterized.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess perceived risk and concern regarding CKD development or progression among high-risk patients seen in primary care, identify predictors of perceptions, and correlate perceptions with adherence to high blood pressure management.
AB  - DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of 195 patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial on hypertension management in 40 Maryland primary care practices.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: We assessed independent predictors (sociodemographics, health literacy, clinical presence of CKD, co-morbid conditions, and health behaviors) of perceived susceptibility (assessed via questionnaire) and adherence (assessed via Hill-Bone blood pressure adherence scale) in multivariable analyses.
AB  - MAIN RESULTS: In this hypertensive majority African American (63%) population, many participants had uncontrolled blood pressure (44%) or diabetes (42%). Few (20%) felt "very likely" to develop CKD and one third (33%) were "very concerned" about developing CKD. Participants who were female and had low health literacy had lower perceived susceptibility to CKD compared to males and those with higher health literacy. Race and diabetes were also associated with perceived susceptibility. Greater perceived susceptibility was associated with poorer blood pressure management adherence scores.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Many high-risk patients have low perceived susceptibility to CKD. Poor blood pressure therapy adherence scores among those with greatest perceived susceptibility suggest fatalistic attitudes about CKD. If our findings are confirmed in larger studies, interventions targeting patient perceptions of CKD risk and other attitudes associated with these perceptions could impact adherence to therapies and health outcomes.

TI  - Reduced in-hospital mortality for heart failure with clinical pathways: the results of a cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital treatment of heart failure (HF) frequently does not follow published guidelines, potentially contributing to HF high morbidity, mortality and economic cost. The Experimental Prospective Study on the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Implementation of Clinical Pathways was undertaken to determine how clinical pathways (CP) for hospital treatment of HF affected care variability, guidelines adherence, in-hospital mortality and outcomes at discharge. Methods/
AB  - DESIGN: Two-arm, cluster-randomised trial. Fourteen community hospitals were randomised either to the experimental arm (CP: appropriate therapeutic guidelines use, new organisation and procedures, patient education) or to the control arm (usual care). The main outcome was in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes were length and appropriateness of the stay, rate of unscheduled readmissions, customer satisfaction, usage of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures during hospital stay and quality indicators at discharge. All outcomes were measured using validated instruments available in literature.
AB  - RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 5.6% in the experimental arm (n = 12); 15.4% in controls (n = 33, p = 0.001). In CP and usual care groups, the mean rates of unscheduled readmissions were 7.9% and 13.9%, respectively. Adjusting for age, smoking, New York Heart Association score, hypertension and source of referral, patients in the CP group, as compared to controls, had a significantly lower risk of in-hospital death (OR 0.18; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.46) and unscheduled readmissions (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.87). No differences were found between CP and control with respect to the appropriateness of the stay, costs and patient's satisfaction. Except for electrocardiography, all recommended diagnostic procedures were used more in the CP group. Similarly, pharmaceuticals use was significantly greater in CP, with the exception of diuretics and anti-platelets agents.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The introduction of a specifically tailored CP for the hospital treatment of HF was effective in reducing in-hospital mortality and unscheduled readmissions. This study adds to previous knowledge indicating that CP should be used to improve the quality of hospital treatment of HF.

TI  - Clinical experience in treating hypertension with fixed-dose combination therapy: angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan plus hydrochlorothiazide. [Review] [102 refs]
AB  - The goal of antihypertensive treatment is to reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events associated with high blood pressure. A combination therapy with different antihypertensive agents is more successful than monotherapy in most hypertensive patients, with the added advantage of a better safety profile. Therefore, treatment of hypertensive patients with fixed-dose combination therapy consisting of the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan along with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) has several potential benefits over monotherapy with each individual component. It provides more effective blood pressure control, a reduction in the likelihood of adverse effects and facilitation of patient compliance due to a simple once-daily regimen. One of the advantages of the combination of losartan with HCTZ is the potential reduction in HCTZ-induced metabolic disorders; in particular, this combination can have attractive benefits for patients of hyperuricemia. Losartan plus HCTZ fixed-dose combination therapy is frequently recommended for the treatment of hypertension and lowers blood pressure in mild-to-moderate and even severe hypertensive patients to a level comparable with other classes of antihypertensive agents in combination with HCTZ. Fixed-dose combination therapy with losartan plus HCTZ is a logical choice as antihypertensive therapy for patients in whom combination therapy is necessary to achieve additional blood pressure reduction.

TI  - Feasibility of blood pressure telemonitoring in patients with poor blood pressure control.
AB  - We examined the feasibility of using home blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring devices for managing patients with poor BP control. We enrolled 591 subjects with a diagnosis of hypertension. Patients were randomized to usual care (n = 147) or to the intervention arm (n = 441). Those in the intervention arm were issued with a home BP telemonitoring device. The device transmitted BP readings automatically via the home telephone line. Technical alerts were generated if patients did not transmit their BP readings according to the protocol. During the first six months, 693 technical alerts were generated by 267 patients. About half of these patients (112) generated more than two technical alerts. Resolution of the alerts showed that 61% were caused by patient non-adherence. Patients who generated >2 technical alerts were younger (61 vs. 64 years; P = 0.001) and were more likely to be non-Caucasian (64% vs. 47%, P = 0.002) than those generating 2 or fewer alerts. Despite the potential for improving health care using home BP telemonitoring, certain patients will require more support to use the equipment successfully.

TI  - Compound ion salt, a novel low-sodium salt substitute: from animal study to community-based population trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Salt restriction, an important approach for primary and secondary prevention of hypertension, is undermined by unsatisfactory adherence. A salt-restriction study tested the efficacy and safety of a compound ion salt (CISalt) with low sodium content in an animal model and in a community-based population.
AB  - METHODS: In part 1, 8-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were fed 1% CISalt in the study group and 8% or 1% normal salt (NSalt) in controls (n = 10 each) for 12 weeks. Blood pressure (BP) and urinary electrolytes were measured every 3 weeks. After 12 weeks, collagen deposition in the heart and kidney and the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and nitric oxide (NO) in plasma and renal cortex were measured. In part 2, a single-blind, randomized, 6-month controlled trial with CISalt was conducted in 248 persons (age >or=65 years) in 10 rural communities. Plasma renin activity and Ang II were included in blood and urinary measures at baseline and 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Reduced BP urinary protein excretion and reduced collagen in the heart and kidneys were significantly different in animals fed CISalt compared to controls. In human studies, at 6 months, mean systolic BP (SBP) was decreased by 9.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI): 13.1 to 6.1, P < 0.001) and diastolic BP (DBP) by 5.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 7.9 to 2.6, P < 0.001), respectively, compared to controls; urinary sodium excretion also decreased by 67.4 mmol/24 h (95% CI: 84.8 to 50.0, P < 0.001), and plasma renin activity was slightly increased by 0.19 ng/ml/h (95% CI: 0.04-0.33, P = 0.013). No adverse cardiovascular events were reported.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In these studies, CISalt lowered BP and showed end-organ protection in hypertensive animals and BP reduction in humans. CISalt appears to be a safe and acceptable strategy to reduce BP.

TI  - Do proton pump inhibitors attenuate the effect of aspirin on platelet aggregation? A randomized crossover study.
AB  - It is common practice to coadminister proton pump inhibitors with aspirin to diminish the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This is the first study that investigated the potential impact of a proton pump inhibitor on aspirin effects on platelet aggregation. Twenty-four hypertensive subjects eligible for treatment with low-dose enteric-coated aspirin (LDECA) for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease were randomized to receive 100 mg LDECA or 100 mg LDECA plus 30 mg lansoprazole for 4 weeks. Then, participants were crossed over to the alternative regimen for another 4 weeks. Salicylic, gastrin, and pepsinogen I blood level counting were used to ensure adherence to treatment. Platelet aggregation was evaluated by light transmittance aggregometry and PFA100. The LDECA administration reduced arachidonic acid (P < 0.001), collagen (P < 0.01), and epinephrine (P < 0.001) tests. These changes paralleled an increase in collagen/epinephrine duration (P < 0.001) but not in collagen/adenosine diphosphate duration and platelet count. No significant difference was found in any of these platelets' function tests with LDECA alone versus LDECA plus lansoprazole. A significant increase in salicylic levels was observed in patients on LDECA as well as in those on LDECA plus lansoprazole, whereas gastrin and pepsinogen I levels were increased only when lansoprazole was added. These data suggest that the concomitant use of the lansoprazole at 30-mg daily does not influence the long-term effect of LDECA on platelet aggregation. Furthermore, they might imply that an interaction of LDECA with other proton pump inhibitors on platelet aggregation is unlikely.

TI  - Intensifying therapy for hypertension despite suboptimal adherence.
AB  - More intensive management can improve control blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients. However, many would posit that treatment intensification (TI) is not beneficial in the face of suboptimal adherence. We investigated whether the effect of TI on BP varies by adherence. We enrolled 819 patients with hypertension, managed in primary care at an academically-affiliated inner-city hospital. We used the following formula to characterize TI: (visits with a medication change-visits with elevated BP)/total visits. Adherence was characterized using electronic monitoring devices ("MEMS caps"). Patients who returned their MEMS caps (671) were divided into quartiles of adherence, whereas patients who did not return their MEMS caps (148) had "missing" adherence. We examined the relationship between TI and the final systolic blood pressure (SBP), controlling for patient-level covariates. In the entire sample, each additional therapy increase per 10 visits predicted a 2.0 mm Hg decrease in final SBP (P<0.001). After stratifying by adherence, in the "best" adherence quartile each therapy increase predicted a 2.1-mm Hg decrease in final SBP, followed by 1.8 for the "next-best" adherence quartile, 2.3 in the third quartile, and 2.4 in the "worst" adherence quartile. The effect size for patients with "missing" adherence was 1.6 mm Hg. The differences between the group with "best" adherence and the other 4 groups were not statistically significant. In this observational study, treatment intensification was associated with similar BP improvement regardless of the patient's level of adherence. A randomized trial could further examine optimal management of patients with suboptimal adherence.

TI  - The effect of patient race and blood pressure control on patient-physician communication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in hypertension control contribute to higher rates of cardiovascular mortality among blacks. Patient-physician communication quality is associated with better health outcomes, including blood pressure (BP) control. Both race/ethnicity and BP control may adversely affect communication.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether being black and having poor BP control interact to adversely affect patient-physician communication more than either condition alone, a situation referred to as "double jeopardy."
AB  - DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study of enrollment data from a randomized controlled trial of interventions to enhance patient adherence to therapy for hypertension. Participants included 226 hypertensive patients and 39 physicians from 15 primary care practices in Baltimore, MD.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Communication behaviors and visit length from coding of audiotapes.
AB  - RESULTS: After controlling for patient and physician characteristics, blacks with uncontrolled BP have shorter visits (B = -3.9 min, p < 0.01) with less biomedical (B = -24.0, p = 0.05), psychosocial (B = -19.4, p < 0.01), and rapport-building (B = -19.5, p = 0.01) statements than whites with controlled BP. Of all communication outcomes, blacks with uncontrolled BP are only in "double jeopardy" for a patient positive affect-coders give them lower ratings than all other patients. Blacks with controlled BP also experience shorter visits and less communication with physicians than whites with controlled BP. There are no significant communication differences between the visits of whites with uncontrolled versus controlled BP.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that patient race is associated with the quality of patient-physician communication to a greater extent than BP control. Interventions that improve patient-physician communication should be tested as a strategy to reduce racial disparities in hypertension care and outcomes.

TI  - [Non-pharmacological intervention as a strategy to improve antihypertensive treatment compliance]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of an intervention by means of an educational magazine on treatment compliance in uncontrolled arterial hypertension (AHT).
AB  - DESIGN: Controlled, randomised clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: 87 primary care centres. Spain.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 450 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were included.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Two groups of 225 patients were formed: 1) Control group (CG): standard health intervention; 2) Intervention Group (IG): received a twice monthly educational magazine at home.
AB  - MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Compliance was measured using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS-Aardex). Compliance rate (CR) was recorded. Compliers were defined as individuals with a treatment compliance of 80-110%. The percentage of compliers, the mean percentage of doses taken and the percentage of patients taking the medication at the correct times were estimated. The mean blood pressures (BPs) and the percentage of controlled patientswere calculated. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 393 individuals were evaluable (Age: 62.4 years), 196 in the IG and 197 in the CG. There were 83.2% (95% CI 78-88.4) and 49.2% (95% CI 42.2-56.2) (P=0.0001) of overall compliers in the IG and CG, respectively and 74% (95% CI: 67.9-80.1) and 42.6% (95% CI=35.7-49.5) (P=0.0001) of correct times compliers. A total of 81.6% (95% CI=76.2-86.5%)) were controlled in the IG and 56.3% (95% CI=49.4-63.2) in the CG. The NNT was 3.3 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic non-compliance was very high. The educational magazine is an effective strategy to improve the compliance and degree of control of the AHT.

The blood pressure (BP) measurement made during the patient's recent visit and documented in the medical files was used in the study. Controlled BP values for hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus were defined per JNC 7 guidelines: 130/80 mmHg or lower. Proportions of use of 5 different antihypertensive drug classes were compared between patients with controlled and uncontrolled BP.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 311 patients, 79 (25.4%) had their BP controlled. No significant differences in age, gender, body weight, duration of hypertension or diabetes, renal function, average number of anti-hypertensive medications and doses of most commonly reported antihypertensive medications were found between controlled and uncontrolled BP groups. ACE-I/ARB was the most commonly used drug class in both groups. Overall, the use of ACE-I/ARB, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers and multi drug regimens were also not significantly different between the controlled and uncontrolled groups. However, overall use of diuretics was significantly higher in controlled group than uncontrolled group (59.5% versus 45.7%, p < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite the common use of ACE-I/ ARB as recommended per JNC 7th report, the majority of the patients had uncontrolled BP. Diuretics is an important drug class in attaining target BP. Use of diuretics in combination with ACE-I as well as drug compliance needs to be emphasized and encouraged.

TI  - Adherence to the DASH Diet is inversely associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes: the insulin resistance atherosclerosis study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been widely promoted; however, little is known about its impact on type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We evaluated the association of the DASH diet with incidence of type 2 diabetes among 862 participants of the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) who completed a 1-year food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Type 2 diabetes odds ratios (ORs) were estimated at tertiles of the DASH score. RESULTS An inverse association was observed in whites (tertile 2 vs. tertile 1, OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.29-1.48]) that became significant for the most extreme contrast (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1, 0.31 [0.13-0.75]), with adjustment for covariates. No association was observed in blacks or Hispanics (tertile 2 vs. tertile 1, 1.16 [0.61-2.18 ]; tertile 3 vs. tertile 1, 1.34 [0.70-2.58 ]). CONCLUSIONS Adherence to the DASH dietary pattern, which is rich in vegetables, fruit, and low-fat dairy products, may have the potential to prevent type 2 diabetes.

TI  - The gender differences in baseline characteristics and statin intervention among outpatients with coronary heart disease in China: the China Cholesterol Education Program.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The China Cholesterol Education Program (CCEP) aimed to investigate the baseline characteristics of outpatients with coronary heart disease (CHD) according to gender, especially lipid levels, statin intervention, and rates of achieving their goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 4778 CHD outpatients were enrolled from 52 centers in 6 Chinese cities from January 2006 to January 2007.
AB  - RESULTS: Female outpatients were significantly older than male outpatients (66+/-10 vs 63+/-11 years, P <0.001). Male outpatients were more likely to smoke than female outpatients (P<0.001). Female outpatients had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, LDL-C level, and total cholesterol level (all P values <0.001). About 82% of the participants received statin therapy. The LDL-C levels were 3.06+/-1.08 mmol/L and 2.89+/-0.97 mmol/L in outpatients at high risk and very high risk respectively (P<0.001). Though there were higher rates of statin intervention, only 36.2% of the high risk outpatients got to the target LDL-C level (<2.6 mmol/L); 10.9% of the very high risk outpatients achieved the optimal LDL-C level (<1.82 mmol/L) suggested by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. The rate of achieving target was only 42.2%, even when LDL-C <2.6 mmol/L was the target level for patients at very high risk. Only 19.4% of the outpatients at very high risk achieved the target (LDL-C <2.08 mmol/L) suggested by the updated Chinese guideline for CHD.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Although the outpatients received a higher rate of statin therapy, the rates of achieving the target were lower. There is still a significant gap between the guidelines and clinical practice in statin intervention among these CHD outpatients, particularly for women.Copyright 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - [Control of therapeutic inertia in the treatment of arterial hypertension by using different strategies]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of different interventions on therapeutic Inertia (TI) in mild-to-moderate hypertension (AHT).
AB  - DESIGN: Controlled, randomised clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: Two hundred clinics in 5 primary care centres. Spain.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1104 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were included.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Four groups with 276 patients were formed: 1) Control group (CG): standard health intervention; 2) Education intervention and a program of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) (EG); 3) Card control intervention and HBPM programme (CHG); 4) Education intervention, card control and HBPM programme (ECHG).
AB  - MAIN MEASUREMENTS: TI was calculated by the rate: (Number of patients whose pharmacological treatment was not changed in each visit/Number of patients with an average BP 140mmHg and/or 90mmHg in the general population or 130 and/or 90 mmHg in diabetics). The mean BPs and the percentage of controlled patients were calculated. The mean number of people that required an intervention in order to avoid TI was calculated (NI).
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 921 patients completed the study, and 1842 visits were made, with TI in 36.8% (IC=5.8%) of the sample and in 82.58% (IC=8.2%) of the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The TI was 60% (CI=4.2%), 38.4% (CI=4.4%) 30.2 (CI=4.3%) and 14.7 (CI=3.3%) (p=0.001) for CG, EG, CHG and ECHG, respectively. The percentage controlled at the end of study was 35.3% (CI=1.1%), 54.7% (CI=1.8%), 60.2% (CI=2.1%) and 65.1% (CI=2.2%) (p<0.01) for CG, EG, CHG and ECHG, respectively. The NI were 4.6, 3.3 and 2.2 for CG, EG, CHG and ECHG, respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TI was very significant among the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The studied interventions are effective for improving TI.

TI  - The effect of the content of the knowledge on adherence to medication in hypertensive patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It was suggested that knowledge might influence the adherence to treatment in hypertension. Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the effects of content of knowledge on medication adherence and knowledge-based predictors of adherence to treatment in hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 227 hypertensive patients (70% female;mean age: 57+/-12 years), who were followed by cardiology and internal medicine clinics. The patients were asked to fulfill a questionnaire including 40 items. Besides the demographic and disease-related questions, the patients were also asked (1) the name of the drug, (2) the duration of the drug use;(3) the reason of using the drug;(4) the cause of hypertension;(5) the target level of hypertension;(6) the result of hypertension;(7) the side effects of antihypertensive medicines. Statistical analyses were performed using Chi-square, Fischer exact, Mann Whitney U tests and logistic regression analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: It was found that 163 (72%) were adherent and 64 (28%) were nonadherent to the treatment. Angiotensin-II receptor antagonist use (OR=4.405;95%CI: 1.561-12.365, p=0.022) and hypertension duration > or =5 years (OR=0.446;95%CI: 0.246-0.811, p=0.006) was found to be independently related to adherence. Among the knowledge-based variables, knowing the duration of use of the medicine (OR=6.822;95% CI: 1.478-31.241, p=0.075), the reason of use of medicine (OR=2.828;95% CI: 1.445-5.543, p=0.018), the cause of the hypertension (OR=3.447;95% CI: 1.889-6.290, p=0.037) and the target level of blood pressure (OR=12.859;95% CI: 5.045-32.640, p<0.001) significantly increased the adherence rates. On the other hand, knowing the name of the medicine (p=0.112) or the results of hypertension (p=0.719) had no effect on adherence, while knowing the side effects of the medicine (OR=0.607;95% CI: 0.340-1.084, p=0.005) had negative effect. The total number of correct answers was also higher in patients with adherence to treatment (p=0.002).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patient knowledge about hypertension and medications is associated with higher adherence rates. However, it should be taken into consideration that the possible effects of knowledge may differ according to its content.

TI  - Effectiveness of a trandolapril-based treatment regimen in subjects with isolated systolic hypertension in Canada.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This report evaluates the effectiveness of a titration-based, escalating dose regimen based on trandolapril in subjects with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) treated in Canadian clinical practice.
AB  - METHODS: Substudy of the TRAIL (Trandolapril Regimen Applied In real Life) study; a prospective, open-label, single cohort, multicentre study in 192 Canadian primary care practices. Subjects with ISH received trandolapril therapy, initiated at 1 mg/day (0.5 mg/day in subjects on diuretics) and increased to 2 or 4 mg at 4 and 9 weeks, respectively, in those not achieving blood-pressure (BP) targets, subject to tolerability. If BP was not controlled after 14 weeks of treatment subjects could be put on trandolapril 4 mg/verapamil 240 mg while continuing the diuretic, or verapamil could be added to the existing regimen. The observation period was 26 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the achievement of target BP levels after 14 weeks.
AB  - RESULTS: Systolic BP (SBP) was significantly (p < 0.01) reduced from 167.3 +/- 8.7 mmHg at baseline to 136.8 +/- 14.0 mmHg (means +/- SD) at Week 14. The reductions were maintained at Week 26: mean SBP at this time point was 137.4 +/- 12.5 mmHg. The target BP levels of < or =140/90 mmHg at Week 14 was reached by 67% of subjects with ISH. Among study limitations were the observational design; the lack of randomisation and control group, and the fact that subjects with ISH represented a comparatively small number of subjects.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A titration-based, escalating-dose regimen based on trandolapril is effective in subjects with ISH under treatment conditions seen in general clinical practice in Canada.

TI  - Practical aspects of treatment discontinuation and adherence.
AB  - Hypertension control in populations, although improving, remains far from satisfactory, even though effective and inexpensive therapies are available. Among many factors responsible for this situation, poor adherence to treatment appears to be particularly important. Unfortunately, even if its causes have been quite well defined, this problem is still far from being solved in clinical practice. The present paper discusses the key issues related to treatment adherence, and discontinuation in hypertension, in the light of recent evidence coming from the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) and Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in ACE iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease trial (TRANSCEND).

TI  - Management of hypertension with the fixed combination of perindopril and amlodipine in daily clinical practice: results from the STRONG prospective, observational, multicenter study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current clinical guidelines recognize that the use of more than one agent is necessary to achieve target BP in the majority of patients. The ASCOT-BPLA trial demonstrated that the free combination of amlodipine and perindopril effectively controlled BP and was better than a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker)/diuretic combination in reducing total mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed combination of perindopril and amlodipine in the clinical setting.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: The STRONG (SafeTy & efficacy analysis of coveRsyl amlodipine in uncOntrolled and Newly diaGnosed hypertension) study was a prospective, observational, multicenter trial.
AB  - SETTING: This was a naturalistic, real-world, clinic-based, outpatient study involving 336 general practitioners/primary care physicians in 65 cities in India.
AB  - PATIENTS: Adults aged 40-70 years with newly diagnosed/untreated stage 2 hypertension (BP >/=160/100 mmHg), hypertension uncontrolled with monotherapy (BP >140/90 mmHg), or hypertension inadequately managed with another combination therapy.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Fixed combination perindopril 4 mg/amlodipine 5 mg once daily for 60 days.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: The primary outcomes were the mean change in BP from baseline and the proportion of patients achieving adequate BP control (</=140/90 mmHg, or </=130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary analyses included incidence of adverse events (ITT) and treatment adherence rate (completers).
AB  - RESULTS: In total, 1250 patients comprised the ITT population: 32.6% with newly diagnosed hypertension; 40.5% with hypertension uncontrolled with monotherapy; and 26.9% with hypertension inadequately managed with another combination therapy. Mean SBP/DBP decreased significantly from baseline (167.4 +/- 15.2/101.4 +/- 9.1 mmHg) over 60 days (-41.9 +/- 34.8/-23.2 +/- 21.8 mmHg; p < 0.0001). Target BP was achieved in 66.1% of patients in the total population, 68.3% of untreated patients, 68.4% of patients uncontrolled with monotherapy, and 59.9% of patients inadequately managed with combination therapy. In 161 patients with SBP >180 mmHg at baseline (newly diagnosed: n = 50; uncontrolled on monotherapy: n = 53; inadequately managed on combination therapy: n = 58), BP was reduced by 63.2 +/- 32.5/29.0 +/- 21.9 mmHg (p < 0.0001) at day 60. The fixed combination was safe and well tolerated. All 1175 patients completing the 60-day study (94%) adhered to their treatment regimen.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Fixed combination perindopril/amlodipine was found to be an effective and well tolerated antihypertensive treatment, with an excellent rate of treatment adherence in the clinical setting. Fixed combination perindopril/amlodipine is expected to be useful in the management of hypertension in primary healthcare, with a positive impact on treatment adherence.

TI  - Validation of the HONSUN LD-578 blood pressure monitor for home blood pressure monitoring according to the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the automated oscillometric upper arm blood pressure monitor LD-578 (HONSUN Group, Shanghai, China) for home blood pressure monitoring according to the International Protocol.
AB  - METHOD: Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were sequentially measured in 33 adult Chinese using a mercury sphygmomanometer (two observers) and the LD-578 device (one supervisor). Ninety-nine pairs of comparisons were obtained from 15 participants in phase 1 and a further 18 participants in phase 2 of the validation study. Data analysis was performed using the ESHIP Analyzer.
AB  - RESULTS: The LD-578 device successfully passed phase 1 of the validation study with a number of absolute differences between device and observers within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg for at least 32 of 45, 41 of 45, and 45 of 45 measurements (required 25, 35, and 40), respectively. The device also achieved the targets for phase 2.1, with 67 of 99, 90 of 99, and 98 of 99 differences within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg, respectively, for systolic blood pressure, and with 69 of 99, 95 of 99, and 98 of 99 within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg, respectively, for diastolic blood pressure. In phase 2.2, 24 participants had at least two of the three device-observers differences within 5 mmHg (required >or=22) for systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The HONSUN upper arm blood pressure monitor LD-578 can be recommended for home use in adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the automated Health & Life oscillometric wrist blood pressure monitor HL168JD for home blood pressure monitoring according to the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol.
AB  - METHODS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were sequentially measured in 33 adult Chinese using the mercury sphygmomanometer (two observers) and the HL168JD device (one supervisor). Ninety-nine pairs of comparisons were obtained from 15 participants in phase 1 and further 18 participants in phase 2 of the validation study. Data analysis was performed using the ESHIP Analyzer program.
AB  - RESULTS: The HL168JD device successfully passed phase 1 of the validation study with a number of absolute differences between device and observers within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg for at least 33/45, 41/45, and 45/45 measurements, respectively. The device also achieved the targets for phase 2.1, with 71/99, 90/99, and 98/99 differences within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg, respectively, for systolic blood pressure, and with 73/99, 89/99, and 99/99 within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg, respectively, for diastolic blood pressure. In phase 2.2, 27 and 26 participants had at least 2 of the 3 device-observers differences within 5 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The Health & Life wrist blood pressure monitor HL168JD can be recommended for home use in adults.

TI  - Implementing a palm pilot intervention for primary care providers: lessons learned.
AB  - The Personal Digital Assistance for Guideline Adherence (GLAD Heart) study was designed to test a strategy to improve quality of care through increased adherence to ATPIII cholesterol guidelines. This paper describes the overall study design including the multi-faceted intervention and outcome measures. Sixty-one primary care practices in NC were recruited and randomized to either a personal digital assistant-based cholesterol management intervention or an intervention similar in intensity and frequency of contact but focused on a hypertension clinical practice guideline. Installation and implementation of the technology intervention was challenging. Over the course of the study, there were 74 technical issues requiring assistance for the palm pilot from 23 participating practices. The GLAD Heart project was completed successfully with some impact on cholesterol management. Technology has the potential to improve the quality of care provided in the healthcare setting. However, potentially expensive interventions such as that conducted in GLAD Heart should undergo rigorous testing to assure their efficacy before widespread adoption.

TI  - Amlodipine and valsartan as components of a rational and effective fixed-dose combination. [Review] [35 refs]
AB  - Pharmacological treatment of hypertension is effective in preventing cardiovascular and renal complications. Calcium antagonists and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system are widely used today to initiate antihypertensive therapy but, when given as monotherapy, do not suffice in most patients to normalize blood pressure. Combining the two types of agents considerably increases the antihypertensive efficacy, but not at the expense of a deterioration of tolerability. This is exemplified by the experience accumulated with the recently developed fixed dose combination containing the AT(1)-receptor blocker valsartan (160 mg) and the dihydropyridine amlodipine (5 or 10 mg). In a randomized trial, an 8-week treatment normalized blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) within 8 weeks in a large fraction of hypertensive patients (78.4% and 85.2% using the 5/160 [n = 371] and 10/160 mg [n = 377] dosage, respectively). Like all AT(1)-receptor blockers valsartan has a placebo-like tolerability. Valsartan prevents to a large extent the occurrence amlodipine-induced peripheral edema. Both amlodipine and valsartan have beneficial effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as protective effects on renal function. The co-administration of these two agents is therefore very attractive, as it enables a rapid and sustained blood pressure control in hypertensive patients. The availability of a fixed-dose combination based on amlodipine and valsartan is expected therefore to facilitate the management of hypertension, to improve long-term adherence with antihypertensive therapy and, ultimately, to have a positive impact on cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

TI  - [How to follow-up on the recommendations of the ESH/ESC guidelines for different kinds of blood pressure measurement methods]. [German]
AB  - Better understanding of epidemiology and pathophysiology of arterial hypertension has resulted in new definitions of blood pressure levels and treatment targets. The main reason for worldwide modest outcomes in the treatment of hypertension is suboptimal drug treatment including incomplete dose titration and an inadequate antihypertensive drug combinations. New techniques such as teletransmission of home blood pressure measurement together with ambulant 24-hour-blood-pressure-monitoring could serve as a solution to provide the physician the opportunity for an adequate antihypertensive therapy, in order to improve drug compliance and to shorten the time until reaching optimal blood pressure.

TI  - Physician reported perception in the treatment of high blood pressure does not correspond to practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: High blood pressure is a significant health problem world-wide. Physician factors play a significant role in the suboptimal control of hypertension in the United States. We sought to better understand primary care physician's opinions regarding use of hypertension guidelines, patient and physician related barriers to treatment and physician treatment decision making in the management of hypertension as part of a first step in developing research tools and interventions designed to address these issues.
AB  - METHODS: An IRB approved survey pertaining to physician opinion regarding the treatment of hypertension. Items consisted of questions regarding: 1) knowledge of hypertension treatment guidelines; 2) barriers to hypertension control (physician vs. patient); and 3) self-estimation of physician treatment of hypertension. Descriptive Statistics were used to describe results.
AB  - RESULTS: All physicians were board certified in family or general internal medicine (n = 28). Practices were located in urban (n = 12), suburban (n = 14) and inner city locations (n = 1). All physicians felt they did a good job of treating hypertension. Most physicians felt the biggest barrier to hypertension control was patient non-compliance. Half of physicians would fail to intensify treatment for hypertension when blood pressure was above recommended levels for all disease states studied (essential hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and renal disease).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Physician ability to assess personal performance in the treatment of hypertension and physician opinion that patient noncompliance is the greatest barrier to optimal hypertension control is contradictory to reported practice behavior. Optimal blood pressure control requires increased physician understanding on the evaluation and management of blood pressure. These data provide crucial formative data to enhance the content validity of physician education efforts currently underway to improve the treatment of blood pressure in the primary care setting.

TI  - Personality traits, depression, and objectively measured adherence to once-daily prostaglandin analog medication in glaucoma.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of personality traits, depression, and training on objectively measured adherence to once-daily prostaglandin analog medication.
AB  - METHODS: Adherence was measured with the Travalert Dosing Aid on 58 consecutive, regularly followed-up glaucoma patients already on self-administered travoprost. Before the 3-month data-collection period all patients received training on use of the device. Psychologic characteristics were measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and Beck Hopeless Scale and Depression Inventory. An adherent day was defined as travoprost instillation at 9 PM +/-2 hours.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence was 77% for the total period. Social desirability was higher than normal (U test, P<0.0001). Seven patients (12.1%) showed mild-to-moderate depression, which was not significantly associated with decreased adherence (Kruskal-Wallis test, P=0.071). Severity of glaucoma, number of ocular and systemic medications, satisfaction with the recording device, and socio-economic characteristics had no influence on adherence.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Objectively measured adherence to once-daily prostaglandin analog medication was good, and not influenced by treatment characteristics or patient factors including mild-to-moderate depression. The elevated social desirability suggests that self-reported adherence is not a reliable measure of adherence in glaucoma.

TI  - Provider communication effects medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of patients' perceptions of providers' communication on medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 439 patients with poorly controlled hypertension followed in community-based healthcare practices in the New York metropolitan area. Patients' rating of their providers' communication was assessed with a perceived communication style questionnaire,while medication adherence was assessed with the Morisky self-report measure.
AB  - RESULTS: Majority of participants were female, low-income, and had high school level educations, with mean age of 58 years. Fifty-five percent reported being nonadherent with their medications; and 51% rated their provider's communication to be non-collaborative. In multivariate analysis adjusted for patient demographics and covariates (depressive symptoms, provider degree), communication rated as collaborative was associated with better medication adherence (beta=-.11, p=.03). Other significant correlates of medication adherence independent of perceived communication were age (beta=.13, p=.02) and depressive symptoms (beta=-.18, p=.001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Provider communication rated as more collaborative was associated with better adherence to antihypertensive medications in a sample of low-income hypertensive African-American patients.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The quality of patient-provider communication is a potentially modifiable element of the medical relationship that may affect health outcomes in this high-risk patient population.

TI  - Rationale and design of the Study Assessing the Effect of Cardiovascular Medications Provided as Low-cost, Evidence-based Generic Samples (SAMPLES) trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Highly effective generic cardiovascular medications are frequently underused, leading to greater overall drug costs and cost-related nonadherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess an intervention to stimulate appropriate generic cardiovascular drug use without creating administrative or financial barriers that may impede essential medication use.
AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: The SAMPLES (Study Assessing the Effect of Cardiovascular Medications Provided as Low-cost, Evidence-based Generic Samples) trial is a clustered, randomized controlled trial of the effect of providing physicians with free generic samples of hydrochlorothiazide for hypertensive patients and simvastatin for patients with hyperlipidemia. We will randomize 660 primary care physicians in Pennsylvania, clustered by physician practice, to receive free samples for both conditions or to receive no samples. We will use data on filled prescriptions obtained from a state-sponsored prescription drug assistance program to perform an intention-to-treat evaluation of the impact of the intervention on physician prescribing behavior (proportion of prescriptions that are generic) and patient adherence. Secondary outcomes will include physician adherence to established guidelines and overall prescription drug costs.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This trial will define the potential role of an innovative approach to stimulate clinically appropriate cost-effective prescribing. We will determine whether free generic samples can reduce overall drug costs as well as out-of-pocket costs to the patient without sacrificing efficacy and whether this approach results in improved adherence to essential cardiovascular medications. This intervention may also improve adherence to practice guidelines and improve the quality of care received. If effective, this strategy could be used broadly by private insurers or government payers aiming to stimulate more cost-effective and higher-quality care.

TI  - An in vivo confocal microscopy analysis of effects of topical antiglaucoma therapy with preservative on corneal innervation and morphology.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term effects of preservative-free and preservative-containing antiglaucoma eye drops on the tear secretion and ocular surface.
AB  - DESIGN: Comparative retrospective study.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 84 patients with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension divided into 5 groups according to type of topical hypotensive therapy and 20 healthy age-matched volunteers were studied. Clinical tests (corneal sensitivity, Schirmer I test, and lachrymal film break-up time), and in vivo confocal microscopy were performed in all patients.
AB  - RESULTS: A significant reduction of the scores was found between groups on topical hypotensive therapy and the control group in all clinical parameters studied (P < .05). In particular, the clinical scores were significantly lower in the preservative medication groups than in the preservative-free group (P < .05). The density of superficial epithelial cells was reduced in all glaucomatous patients, except for the preservative-free group (P > .05), with respect to control subjects (P < .001). On the contrary, the density of basal epithelial cells of glaucomatous preservative therapy groups was higher than control and preservative-free groups (P < .05). Stromal keratocyte activation and the number of beads were higher in all glaucoma preservative groups (P < .05). The number of sub-basal nerves was lower in all glaucoma groups than in the control group (P < .05) and tortuosity was significantly higher in glaucoma than control groups (P < .05). Reflectivity of fibers did not show any significant difference between the 6 groups (P < .05).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Glaucomatous patients with chronic treatment show ocular surface alterations. The development of nontoxic antiglaucoma treatment may reduce damage to the ocular surface and improve the compliance and the adherence in the medical therapy.

TI  - Medication acquisition and self-reported adherence in veterans with hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine factors associated with oversupply and undersupply of antihypertensive medication, and examine evidence for medication acquisition as distinct from self-reported adherence.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN: Analysis of pharmacy refill records, medical charts, and in-person interviews.
AB  - SUBJECTS: Five hundred sixty-two male veterans with hypertension enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to improve BP control.
AB  - MEASURES: Patients were classified as having undersupply (<0.80), appropriate supply (> or = 0.80 and < or = 1.20), or oversupply (>1.20) of antihypertensive medication in the 90 days before trial enrollment based on the ReComp algorithm. Determination of BP control was based on clinic measurements at enrollment. Demographic, clinical, psychosocial, and behavioral factors relevant to medication-taking behavior and BP were assessed at enrollment.
AB  - RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of the patients had undersupply, 47% had appropriate supply, and 30% had oversupply of antihypertensive medication. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that using fewer classes of antihypertensive medications and greater perceived adherence barriers were independently associated with greater likelihood of undersupply. Current employment was associated with decreased likelihood of oversupply, and greater comorbidity and being married were associated with increased likelihood of oversupply. Agreement between ReComp and self-reported adherence was poor (kappa = 0.19, P < 0.001). Undersupply, oversupply, and self-reported nonadherence were all independently associated with decreased likelihood of BP control after adjusting for each other and patient factors.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive oversupply was common and may arise from different circumstances than undersupply. Measures of medication acquisition and self-reported adherence appear to provide distinct, complementary information about patients' medication-taking behavior.

TI  - Impact of supportive measures on drug adherence in patients with essential hypertension treated with valsartan: the randomized, open-label, parallel group study VALIDATE.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The majority of treated hypertensive patients do not achieve target blood pressure (BP) levels of less than 140/90 mmHg. One key reason is inadequate adherence with the prescribed drug regimen. Dosing regimens are either not executed as prescribed (noncompliance) or patients stop taking the medication (nonpersistence). It has been demonstrated that adherence with angiotensin receptor antagonists such as valsartan is high due to the tolerability profile of this drug class. The present study was designed to evaluate whether drug adherence could further be improved by the use of supportive measures.
AB  - DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-eight centers were randomized to provide pharmacological treatment with or without a set of supportive measures (e.g. structured physician-patient interaction, printed information about hypertension, reminder stickers, 24 h timer, and home BP measurement device). Two hundred and two patients with grade 1 hypertension (BP at baseline 149.8 +/- 6.2/93.9 +/- 4.4 mmHg) who were either newly diagnosed or who had not been treated for at least 1 year were included in this trial. All patients entered the 34-week treatment phase with valsartan 160 mg daily. Titration to valsartan 160 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg was allowed if necessary. Drug adherence was assessed by electronic monitors (Medication Event Monitoring System).
AB  - RESULTS: Patients treated with a valsartan-based therapy receiving supportive measures as compared with the standard care group demonstrated an initially higher level of adherence with a maximum absolute difference of 7.8% (P = 0.041). This difference did not persist over the observation period but faded with time. In parallel, execution of the dosing regimen (compliance) was also improved in the intervention group during the early months of treatment but this effect also disappeared by the end of the observation period. In contrast, persistence in the two groups slowly but continuously separated over time. Estimated absolute difference in persistence at the end of the 34-weeks study between the two groups was 7.6% (95.9 vs. 88.3%) reflecting a 66% lower hazard of discontinuation in the intervention group (P = 0.073). BP control improved more in patients with the supportive measures.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Drug adherence improved initially with the use of supportive measures. However, this effect faded with time mainly because of the short-lived improvement in the quality of execution (compliance) achieved. In contrast, a longer lasting effect of the chosen supportive measures on persistence could be demonstrated, which, however, at least under the conditions of the present study, did not translate into a persistent improvement of medication adherence.

TI  - Antihypertensive prescriptions for newly treated patients before and after the main antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial results and seventh report of the joint national committee on prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure guidelines.
AB  - Main results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial were published in December 2002. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, published in May 2003, recommended thiazide-type diuretics as initial pharmacological treatment alone or in combination with another drug in most patients with hypertension. To assess changes from before to after these publications, we compared antihypertensive medication prescriptions filled by patients who initiated pharmacological antihypertensive treatment in a large managed care organization during 3 time periods: (1) July 1, 2001, to June 30, 2002 (before these publications; n=1354); (2) July 1, 2003, to June 30, 2004 (to assess short-term changes; n=1542); and (3) July 1, 2004, to June 30, 2005 (to assess extended changes; n=1865). The percentage of patients initiating antihypertensive treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic increased from 30.6% to 39.4% (P<0.001) between 2001-2002 and 2003-2004, and the increase was maintained at 36.5% in 2004-2005 (P<0.001 compared with 2001-2002 and P=0.33 compared with 2003-2004). Among patients without diabetes mellitus, renal disease, a history of myocardial infarction, or heart failure, the percentage initiating pharmacological antihypertensive treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic increased from 33.1% in 2001-2002 to 43.4% in 2003-2004 (P<0.001) and remained increased (41.0%) in 2004-2005 (P<0.001 and P=0.23 compared with 2001-2002 and 2003-2004, respectively). Despite a sustained increase in the use of thiazide-type diuretics, this study indicates that an opportunity exists to increase adherence to the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines.

TI  - Evaluation of a hypertension medication therapy management program in patients with diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a 9-month community pharmacy-based medication therapy management (MTM) program on quality of care in patients with diabetes and hypertension.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Tulsa, OK, between November 2005 and July 2007.
AB  - PATIENTS: 52 patients with diabetes and hypertension who were enrolled in a managed care organization.
AB  - INTERVENTION: During monthly visits, intervention group participants received MTM services for hypertension and diabetes management.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systolic blood pressure (SBP), percentage at goal blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg), and antihypertensive medication adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean intervention group SBP decreased 17.32 mm Hg, whereas the mean control group SBP level increased 2.73 mm Hg (P = 0.003). The percentage of patients at goal blood pressure increased from 16.0% to 48.0% in the intervention group and decreased from 20.0% to 6.67% in the control group. Intervention group participants were 12.92 times more likely than control group participants to achieve goal blood pressure (P = 0.021). Although the mean adherence rate in the intervention group increased 7.0% while remaining fairly constant in the control group (-0.7%), this group difference was not statistically significant.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A community pharmacy-based hypertension MTM program was effective in improving blood pressure control among managed care enrollees with diabetes and hypertension. Community pharmacists are strategically positioned to provide MTM services and effectively communicate with providers to improve quality of care for patients.

TI  - Hypertension Improvement Project (HIP): study protocol and implementation challenges.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects 29% of the adult U.S. population and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Despite numerous effective treatments, only 53% of people with hypertension are at goal blood pressure. The chronic care model suggests that blood pressure control can be achieved by improving how patients and physicians address patient self-care.
AB  - METHODS AND DESIGN: This paper describes the protocol of a nested 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial to test the separate and combined effects on systolic blood pressure of a behavioral intervention for patients and a quality improvement-type intervention for physicians. Primary care practices were randomly assigned to the physician intervention or to the physician control condition. Physician randomization occurred at the clinic level. The physician intervention included training and performance monitoring. The training comprised 2 internet-based modules detailing both the JNC-7 hypertension guidelines and lifestyle modifications for hypertension. Performance data were collected for 18 months, and feedback was provided to physicians every 3 months. Patient participants in both intervention and control clinics were individually randomized to the patient intervention or to usual care. The patient intervention consisted of a 6-month behavioral intervention conducted by trained interventionists in 20 group sessions, followed by 12 monthly phone contacts by community health advisors. Follow-up measurements were performed at 6 and 18 months. The primary outcome was the mean change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were diastolic blood pressure and the proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control at 6 and 18 months.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Overall, 8 practices (4 per treatment group), 32 physicians (4 per practice; 16 per treatment group), and 574 patients (289 control and 285 intervention) were enrolled. Baseline characteristics of patients and providers and the challenges faced during study implementation are presented. The HIP interventions may improve blood pressure control and lower cardiovascular disease risk in a primary care practice setting by addressing key components of the chronic care model. The study design allows an assessment of the effectiveness and cost of physician and patient interventions separately, so that health care organizations can make informed decisions about implementation of 1 or both interventions in the context of local resources.

TI  - Comparison of methods to assess medication adherence and classify nonadherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication adherence is suboptimal, and clinicians and researchers struggle with identifying nonadherent patients. Various measures of medication adherence exist, but there is controversy regarding which measures provide acceptable data and how nonadherence should be defined.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess agreement among patient self-report, pharmacy refill, and electronic adherence measures and compare the sensitivity and specificity of different cut-points for defining nonadherence.
AB  - METHODS: Data were analyzed from 2 similarly designed randomized controlled trials that assessed a pharmacist's intervention to improve medication adherence among patients with hypertension or heart failure. For each participant, adherence was measured by patient self-report, prescription refill records, and electronic lids on medication containers. Agreement among measures was assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient rho. Correlation coefficients were compared by patient characteristics using Fisher's Z transformation. The sensitivity and specificity of different cut-points for defining nonadherence were calculated.
AB  - RESULTS: Median adherence was 84% for self-report, 86% for electronic, and 91% for prescription refill adherence measurement. Refill and electronic adherence demonstrated the best agreement among measures (rho = 0.48). Age, depression, and other comorbid conditions influenced agreement among measures. Measures were generally in agreement, regardless of how nonadherence was defined. A cut-point of 80% illustrated a fair balance between sensitivity and specificity for all measures.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: All measures provided similar estimates of overall adherence, although refill and electronic measures were in highest agreement. In selection of a measure, practitioners should consider population and disease characteristics, since measurement agreement could be influenced by these and other factors. The commonly used, clinically based cut-point of 80% had a reasonable balance between sensitivity and specificity in studies of adherence in patients with heart failure or hypertension.

TI  - Patient education and provider decision support to control blood pressure in primary care: a cluster randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Less than one third of the 65 million Americans with hypertension have adequate blood pressure (BP) control. This study examined the effectiveness of 2 interventions for improving patient BP control.
AB  - METHODS: This was a 2-level (primary care provider and patient) cluster randomized trial with 2-year follow-up occurring among patients with hypertension enrolled from a Veterans Affairs Medical Center primary care clinic. Primary care providers (n = 17) in the intervention received computer-generated decision support designed to improve guideline concordant medical therapy at each visit; control providers (n = 15) received a reminder at each visit. Patients received usual care or a bimonthly tailored nurse-delivered behavioral telephone intervention to improve hypertension treatment. The primary outcome was proportion of patients who achieved a BP <140/90 mm Hg (<130/85 for diabetic patients) over the 24-month intervention.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 816 eligible patients contacted, 190 refused and 38 were excluded. The 588 enrolled patients had a mean age of 63 years, 43% had adequate baseline BP control, and 482 (82%) completed the 24-month follow-up. There were no significant differences in amount of change in BP control in the 3 intervention groups as compared to the hypertension reminder control group. In secondary analyses, rates of BP control for all patients receiving the patient behavioral intervention (n = 294) improved from 40.1% to 54.4% at 24 months (P = .03); patients in the nonbehavioral intervention group improved from 38.2% to 43.9% (P = .38), but there was no between-group differences at the end of the study.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The brief behavioral intervention showed improved outcomes over time, but there were not significant between group differences.

TI  - Effect of treatment and adherence on ethnic differences in blood pressure control among adults with hypertension.[Erratum appears in Ann Epidemiol. 2009 Jun;19(6):437]
AB  - We evaluated whether hypertension control differs by ethnicity after accounting for patient characteristics, treatment, and adherence to treatment using the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (US population estimate, 42,511,379). Outcome measures were prescribed treatment, treatment adherence, hypertension control (blood pressure [BP]<140/90 mm Hg). Multivariate logistic regression was performed with non-Hispanic whites (NHW) as the comparison group. Non-Hispanic blacks (NHB) were more likely to report medication prescription (odds ratio [OR] 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.5) and being advised to restrict salt (OR 1.5, CI: 1.2-2.0). Among those advised, NHB were more likely to report salt restriction (OR 1.5, CI: 1.1-2.1) and weight-loss attempts (OR 1.7, CI: 1.3-2.3). Among persons advised to follow exercise, alcohol restriction, smoking cessation, tension reduction, or diet modification, NHB (OR 2.2, CI: 1.6-3.0) and Mexican Americans (OR 2.0, CI: 1.1-3.9) were more likely to report adherence. The likelihood of uncontrolled hypertension was higher in NHB (OR 1.4, CI: 1.1-1.7) and Mexican Americans (OR 1.5, CI 1.1-2.0) despite medication adherence. Even after adjustment for treatment and adherence, substantial ethnic differences in hypertension control were found. Initiating treatment, while crucial, is not sufficient and future guidelines should emphasize aggressive treatment escalation to achieve hypertension control.

TI  - Adherence with topical glaucoma medication monitored electronically the Travatan Dosing Aid study.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess patient adherence and behaviors with topical once-daily therapy for glaucoma.
AB  - DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ninety-six patients with glaucoma who were being treated with a prostaglandin analog in 1 or both eyes at the Scheie or Wilmer Eye Institutes between August 2006 and June 2007.
AB  - METHODS: Detailed medical history was obtained from each patient. All subjects used the Travatan Dosing Aid (DA; Alcon, Fort Worth, TX) to administer travoprost as prescribed. Devices were collected at 3 months and the data of drop usage was downloaded using software provided with the dosing aid. Data were analyzed for the 8-week period starting 2 weeks after the enrollment visit and ending 2 weeks before the 3-month visit.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of adherence and patterns of drop usage as indicated by the DA.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 282 subjects consented to be in the study and 86 (30%) withdrew before study completion or had device errors, leaving 196 subjects (70%) with evaluable data at 3 months. The overall mean (+/-standard deviation) adherence rate was 0.71 (+/-0.24), ranging from 0.02 to 0.97. One hundred nine of these patients (55.6%) took greater than 75% of the expected doses. Those with adherence of less than 50% of expected doses showed substantially increased dose taking immediately after the office visit and just before the return visit at 3 months (P = 0.03). The mean adherence rate estimates of the physician and patient self-report were 0.77 and 0.95, respectively. The agreement between the physician assessment and DA-recorded adherence rate showed poor correlation for individual cases (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.00-0.19).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 45% of patients using an electronic monitoring device who knew they were being monitored and were provided free medication used their drops less than 75% of the time. Patients reported far higher medication use than their actual behavior. The ability of the physician to identify which persons are poorly adherent from their self-report or from other subjective clues is poor.

TI  - Self-efficacy mediates the relationship between depressive symptoms and medication adherence among hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - Many studies have documented the negative effects of depression on adherence to recommended treatment; however, little is known about the mechanism underlying this relationship. Using the Kenny and Baron analytic framework of mediation, the authors assessed whether self-efficacy mediated the relationship between depression and medication adherence in 167 hypertensive African Americans followed in a primary care practice. Depressive symptoms are associated with poor medication adherence (beta=.013, p=.036) and low self-efficacy (beta=-.008, p=.023). Self-efficacy is negatively associated with medication adherence at follow-up (beta=-.612, p<.001). The relationship between depressive symptoms and medication adherence becomes nonsignificant when controlling for self-efficacy (beta=.010, p=.087). Implications for further examination into the mediating role of self-efficacy and the deleterious effect of depression on medication adherence are discussed.

TI  - A multifaceted intervention to improve blood pressure control: The Guideline Adherence for Heart Health (GLAD) study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although high blood pressure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, the proportion reaching the goal blood pressures as outlined in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) is low. We conducted a randomized trial in primary care practices of a multifactorial intervention targeted to improve providers' adherence to hypertension guidelines.
AB  - METHOD: A total of 61 primary care practices in North Carolina were randomized to receive either a multifactorial intervention (guideline dissemination via a continuing medical education session, academic detailing sessions, audit and feedback on preintervention rates of adherence, and automated blood pressure machines) or an attention control of similar magnitude but targeted at a different guideline. Outcomes were determined through review of patient charts conducted by an independent masked quality assurance organization.
AB  - RESULTS: We found no difference between the 2 groups in any of the adherence measures including no difference in the percentage of patients at goal (intervention 49.2%, control 50.6%), with undiagnosed hypertension (18.1% vs 13.6%), average systolic (126 vs 125.1 mm Hg), or diastolic blood pressure (73.1 vs 73.4 mm Hg). Similarly, there was no difference in provider adherence to treatment recommendations (use of thiazide-type diuretic as first-line therapy: 32% vs 29.5%; use of 2-drug therapy in stage 2 hypertension: 11.3% vs 10.4%).
AB  - CONCLUSION: An intensive, multifactorial intervention did not improve adherence to national hypertension guidelines among community-based primary care. Efforts should be focused on other types of interventions to improve rates of control of hypertension.

TI  - Can individuals meet multiple physical activity and dietary behavior goals?.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether participants with the most behavioral goals to achieve were more likely to meet more goals than those given fewer goals.
AB  - METHODS: Eight hundred ten participants were randomly assigned to advice-only, established guidelines for blood pressure control (reduced sodium, increased physical activity), or established guidelines plus the DASH diet (increased fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, reduced fat).
AB  - RESULTS: At 6 months, 11.7% of Advice-Only, 19.3% of Established, and 44.6% of Established plus DASH met at least 3 goals (P<0.0001). At 18 months, 33.5% of Established plus DASH met at least 3 goals.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Those with the most goals to achieve reached the most goals.

TI  - Control of blood pressure in North Carolina primary care: baseline data from the GLAD Heart Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In general, adherence to blood pressure guidelines is low. We assessed whether hypertension recognition and control in North Carolina was consistent with the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) in primary care practices participating in a quality improvement study regarding the implementation of the ATP3 cholesterol management guideline in primary care in North Carolina (GLAD Heart).
AB  - METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from 5,073 charts (patients aged 21-84 years, seen from June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2003) at 60 practices. Sites were non-university based primary care practices from 22 North Carolina counties. A dyslipidemia screening was defined as a lipid profile performed when not on lipid-lowering therapy. Among patients receiving a lipid profile, the proportion with diagnosed, undiagnosed, and controlled hypertension, was calculated according to JNC 7 guidelines. Practice level hypertension control was examined using the median and interquartile range across practices.
AB  - RESULTS: Among 1,763 patients screened for dyslipidemia, 49.4% had diagnosed hypertension. Only 67 individuals (3.8%) had undiagnosed hypertension. Although 85.8% of hypertensive patients were treated, the median proportions of patients with blood pressure below goal (< 140/90, < 130/80 with diabetes) was 33.3% (21.8%-43.7%), with women more likely to be controlled and individuals treated by a solo provider less likely to be controlled.
AB  - LIMITATIONS: These data were abstracted from the charts of patients who received a lipid profile; therefore, they are only generalizable to individuals who are screened for hyperlipidemia.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There remains a need to improve hypertension management in North Carolina primary care among patients screened for hyperlipidemia.

TI  - Prescription pattern of anti-hypertensive drugs in a tertiary health institution in Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the pattern of physicians' prescription of antihypertensive drugs and its possible effects on blood pressure control as well as physicians' compliance with recommended guidelines.
AB  - METHODS: Records of 145 patients aged 17-91 (mean: 52.6+/-14.6) years, with male to female ratio of 1:1.2 were randomly selected. Information on antihypertensive prescriptions was recorded. Blood pressure control was defined as systolic and diastolic blood pressure less than 140 mm Hg and 90 mmHg, respectively.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 145 patients studied, 20% (29) were on monotherapy and 80% (116) on combination therapy. Of the patients on combination therapy, 61.2% (71), 33.6% (39) and 5.2% (6) were on 2, 3 and 4 drugs, respectively. Diuretic was the most frequently p rescribed drug either as a single agent (44.8%) or as combination therapy (88.8%). Mean reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were more in patients on calcium channel blocker than those on diuretic monotherapy (t=2.5 and 3.6 for reductions in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively; P<.05 for both), and, in patients on combination therapy than those on monotherapy (t=3.64 and 3.27 for reductions in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively; P<.01 for both). Blood pressure control rate was 30.5%.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with the previously observed benefits of antihypertensive combination therapy, and demonstrate an apparent higher efficacy of calcium channel blocker monotherapy than diuretic monotherapy in blood pressure lowering in the study population. Major limitations of this work include its retrospective nature and the inability to determine the actual patients' adherence to therapy.

TI  - The German Competence Network on Atrial Fibrillation (AFNET).
AB  - The German Competence Network on Atrial Fibrillation (AFNET) is an interdisciplinary national research network funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) since 2003. The AFNET aims at improving treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), the most frequent sustained arrhythmia of the heart. The AFNET has established a nationwide patient registry on manifestation, diagnostics, and therapy of AF in Germany. The data analyzed to date demonstrate that patients with AF are likely to have multiple comorbidities (hypertension, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus) and an advanced age. Regarding oral anticoagulation, guideline adherence is very high. Basic research has identified specific changes in atrial tissue during AF-induced remodeling providing the rationale for novel therapeutic interventions. Clinical trials are being carried out to optimize pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments. The ANTIPAF trial is designed to prove that angiotensin II receptor blockers reduce the incidence of paroxysmal AF. The Flec-SL trial tests the efficacy of a short-term treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs after cardioversion. The Gap-AF trial investigates the impact of complete pulmonary vein (PV) isolation versus incomplete circumferential PV ablation on AF recurrences. The effect of preventive pacing on the recurrence of paroxysmal AF is studied in the BACE-PACE trial.

TI  - [Effects of community-based case management program for clients with hypertension]. [Korean]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze effects of a community-based case management program for clients with hypertension living in the community.
AB  - METHODS: The research design was a one group pre and post-test design with 30 participants with hypertension who agreed to participate in the 8-12 week case management program provided by case managers from the National Health Insurance Corporation in 2002. Data were collected three times, before and after the case management services, and 6 months later. Outcomes included changes in blood pressure, knowledge of hypertension and daily life practices, including alcohol consumption, smoking, exercise, and medication adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Repeated-measures ANOVA and post-hoc tests of means revealed significant differences before and after service for systolic blood pressure, daily life practices (monitoring body weight and BP, low salt and cholesterol and high vegetable diet, and stress-relief practices), and exercise. The goal for medication adherence was attained after service. Significant improvements from baseline to 6 months after service were observed in measures of salt and vegetables in diet. There were no significant differences on hypertension knowledge, alcohol consumption or smoking behavior between before service and after, and at 6 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The findings provide preliminary evidence that case management intervention can have positive outcomes on BP control, daily life practices, exercise, and medication adherence for clients with hypertension. However, additional interventions are needed to sustain long-term effects.

TI  - Long-term persistence with statin treatment in a not-for-profit health maintenance organization: a population-based retrospective cohort study in Israel.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although discontinuing lipid-lowering treatment can cause preventable morbidity, previously published reports have indicated considerable variability in persistence with statin use. In general, such reports have been limited by short follow-up periods and modest study populations.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to assess long-term persistence with statins and to identify the sociodemographic, clinical, and pharmacotherapy-related factors associated with long-term persistence with statin treatment in first-time users in Israel.
AB  - METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from adult enrollees of a not-for-profit health maintenance organization and from death certificates in Israel. Eligible patients initiated statin treatment between 1998 and 2006. Persistence was assessed separately in patients with no indication of a cardiovascular disease (primary prevention) or coronary artery disease (secondary prevention). Treatment persistence and proportion of days covered (PDC) were measured using the interval between the date of the first prescription dispensation (index date) and the point of discontinuation.
AB  - RESULTS: Data from 229,918 patients were included (primary prevention, 136,052; secondary prevention, 93,866). The PDC was significantly higher in the secondary-prevention group compared with the primary-prevention group (59% vs 45%; P < 0.001). In both cohorts, persistence continually diminished from the index date through follow-up, with > or = 75% of patients discontinuing statin therapy by 2 years. Baseline predictors of discontinuation of statin treatment included younger age, female sex, lower socioeconomic status (SES), absence of diabetes or hypertension, no concurrent use of beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and less health service utilization. New immigrants and patients in the primary-prevention group who had a baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration <130 mg/dL were at increased risk for treatment discontinuation.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In this study in these patients receiving first-time statin treatment in Israel, we found poor persistence with statins among both the primary- and secondary-prevention cohorts, especially among new immigrants and patients with low SES despite low out-of-pocket prescription costs and free access to health services.

TI  - Cognitive function and blood pressure control in hypertensive patients over 60 years of age: COGNIPRES study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aim of the COGNIPRES study was to analyze the prevalence of cognitive impairment in hypertensive individuals over 60 years of age, treated in primary care centres in the context of routine clinical practice. Degree of blood pressure control and treatment compliance, as well as other possible factors that influence cognitive function, were also evaluated.
AB  - METHODS: An epidemiological, multicentre cross-sectional study was made. Demographic, clinical, therapeutic and blood pressure data for the first three hypertensive patients aged over 60 years seen in the primary care centre, and for the first patient visited at home by the physician were recorded. The study was carried out by 477 physicians in 333 primary care centres throughout Spain. Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and therapeutic compliance was assessed using the Haynes-Sacket and Morisky-Green tests.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 1579 patients included in the study, 12.3% (95%CI 10.7-14.0) (n=195) had cognitive impairment. This was significantly associated with patients over 80 years of age (OR 4.97; 95%CI 2.98-8.29), exclusive home care (OR 1.84; 95%CI 1.19-2.83), anxiety (OR 1.84; 95%CI 1.19-2.83), stroke or transient ischemic attack (OR 4.37; 95%CI 2.81-6.78), Parkinson's disease (OR 8.15; 95%CI 2.54-26.12), essential tremor (OR 2.25; 95%CI 1.34-3.79), uncontrolled blood pressure (OR 0.60; 95%CI 0.39-0.94) and poor treatment compliance (OR 0.53; 95%CI 0.37-0.75). Overall, 28.3% of the patients showed controlled blood pressure, and 33.6% showed poor adherence to antihypertensive treatment.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the prevalence of cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients aged over 60 years was 12.3%. Less than a third of the patients had good blood pressure control. Compliance with therapy and good control of blood pressure are associated with better MMSE scores.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of team-based care: impact of physician-pharmacist collaboration on uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effectiveness of collaborative management of hypertension by primary care-pharmacist teams in community-based clinics.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A 12-month prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial in the Providence Primary Care Research Network of patients with hypertension and uncontrolled blood pressure.
AB  - METHODS: As compared to usual primary care, intervention consisted of pharmacy practitioners participating in the active management of hypertension in the primary care office according to established collaborative treatment protocols. At baseline, there was no significant difference in blood pressure between groups. Primary outcome measures were the differences in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures between arms at study end. Secondary measures included blood pressure goal attainment (<140/90 mmHg), hypertension-related knowledge, medication adherence, home blood pressure monitoring, resource utilization, quality of life, and satisfaction.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 463 subjects were enrolled (n = 233 control, n = 230 intervention). Subjects receiving the intervention achieved significantly lower systolic (p = 0.007) and diastolic (p = 0.002) blood pressures compared to control (137/75 mmHg vs. 143/78 mmHg). In addition, 62% of intervention subjects achieved target blood pressure compared to 44% of control subjects (p = 0.003). The intervention group received more total office visits (7.2 vs. 4.9, p < 0.0001), however had fewer physician visits (3.2 vs. 4.7, p < 0.0001) compared to control. Intervention subjects were prescribed more antihypertensive medications (2.7 vs. 2.4, p = 0.02), but did not take more antihypertensive pills per day (2.4 vs. 2.5, p = 0.87). There were minimal differences between groups in hypertension-related knowledge, medication adherence, quality of life, or satisfaction.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients randomized to collaborative primary care-pharmacist hypertension management achieved significantly better blood pressure control compared to usual care with no difference in quality of life or satisfaction.

TI  - A senior center-based pilot trial of the effect of lifestyle intervention on blood pressure in minority elderly people with hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the feasibility, acceptability, and effect of a senior center-based behavioral counseling lifestyle intervention on systolic blood pressure (BP).
AB  - DESIGN: A pre-post design pilot trial of behavioral counseling for therapeutic lifestyle changes in minority elderly people with hypertension. Participants completed baseline visit, Visit 1 (approximately 6 weeks postbaseline), and a final study Visit 2 (approximately 14 weeks postbaseline) within 4 months.
AB  - SETTING: The study took place in six community-based senior centers in New York City with 65 seniors (mean age 72.29+/-6.92; 53.8% female; 84.6% African American).
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five minority elderly people.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Six weekly and two monthly "booster" group sessions on lifestyle changes to improve BP (e.g., diet, exercise, adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications).
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was systolic BP (SBP) measured using an automated BP monitor. Secondary outcomes were diastolic BP (DBP), physical activity, diet, and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications.
AB  - RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in average SBP of 13.0+/-21.1 mmHg for the intervention group (t(25)=3.14, P=.004) and a nonsignificant reduction in mean SBP of 10.6+/-30.0 mmHg for the waitlist control group (t(29)=1.95, P=.06). For the intervention group, adherence improved 26% (t(23)=2.31, P=.03), and vegetable intake improved 23% (t(25)=2.29, P=.03).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This senior center-based lifestyle intervention was associated with a significant reduction in SBP and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications and diet in the intervention group. Participant retention and group attendance rates suggest that implementing a group-counseling intervention in senior centers is feasible.

TI  - Beta testing of a network-based health literacy program tailored for older adults with hypertension.
AB  - A touch screen-enabled "Personal Education Program" was modified to the "next generation" to capture self-medication behaviors of older adults with hypertension and assess related knowledge and self-efficacy. The program analyzes patient-entered information and delivers interactive educational content tailored to the reported behaviors. Summaries of self-reported symptoms, medication use (including frequency/time), drug interactions, and corrective strategies with an illustration of the drug interaction are printed to inform the provider before the primary care visit and for the patient to take home for self-study. After formative research during development and formal diagnostic and verification usability studies with advanced practice nurses and older adults, a beta test was conducted with older adults with hypertension over a 3-month period. Findings from the beta test suggest that older adult user satisfaction was high. Blood pressure declined over the four visits for 82% of the participants. The next generation of the Personal Education Program had a large effect size in increasing knowledge and self-efficacy for avoiding adverse self-medication behaviors. Behavior risk score did not change significantly but was significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure on the fourth visit. The positive results found in this small sample suggest that the next generation of the Personal Education Program could play a central role in facilitating patient-provider communication and medication adherence.

TI  - Alcohol screening scores and medication nonadherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence is common and is associated with adverse outcomes. Alcohol misuse may be a risk factor for nonadherence; however, evidence is limited.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify whether alcohol misuse, as identified by a simple screening tool, is associated in a dose-response manner with increased risk for medication nonadherence in veterans attending primary care clinics.
AB  - DESIGN: Secondary analysis of cohort data collected prospectively from 1997 to 2000 as part of a randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: 7 Veterans Affairs primary care clinics.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 5473 patients taking a statin, 3468 patients taking oral hypoglycemic agents, and 13 729 patients taking antihypertensive medications.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Patients completed the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) questionnaire, a validated 3-question alcohol misuse screening test. Their scores were categorized into nondrinkers; low-level alcohol use; and mild, moderate, and severe alcohol misuse. Medication adherence, defined as having medications available for at least 80% of the observation days, was measured from pharmacy records for either 90 days or 1 year after the alcohol screening date. Logistic regression was used to estimate the predicted proportions of adherent patients in each AUDIT-C group and adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates.
AB  - RESULTS: The proportion of patients treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia who were nonadherent increased with higher AUDIT-C scores. For 1-year adherence to statins, the percentage of adherent patients was lower in the 2 highest alcohol misuse groups (adjusted percentage of adherent patients, 58% [95% CI, 52% to 65%] and 55% [CI, 47% to 63%]) than in the nondrinker group (66% [CI, 64% to 68%]). For 1-year adherence to antihypertensive regimens, the percentage of adherent patients was lower in the 3 highest alcohol misuse groups (adjusted percentage of adherent patients, 61% [CI, 58% to 64%]; 60% [CI, 56% to 63%]; and 56% [CI, 52% to 60%]) than in the nondrinker group (64% [CI, 63% to 65%]). No statistically significant differences were observed for oral hypoglycemics in adjusted analyses.
AB  - LIMITATION: This observational study cannot address whether changes in drinking lead to changes in adherence and may not be generalizable to other populations.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Alcohol misuse, as measured by a brief screening questionnaire, was associated with increased risk for medication nonadherence.

TI  - Assessing medication consultations, hypertension control, awareness, and treatment among elderly Asian community dwellers.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe blood pressure (BP) and medication-related findings of a pharmacist-conducted hypertension (HTN) monitoring program.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective post hoc analysis.
AB  - SETTING: Community site.
AB  - PATIENTS: Multiethnic, community-dwelling, Asian older adults.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Medication consultation/BP records from 1998-2005 were reviewed. Participants' mean baseline BP readings were classified using guidelines from the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) and stratified into three groups: < or =70, 71-79, and > or =80 years of age. Medication consultations were grouped into: lifestyle/general medication review, adherence assessment, non-HTN medication consults, and specific consults, which included pharmacist-provided, medication-related recommendations. Participants with specific consults and subsequent self-reported changes in HTN therapy were identified. Their mean BP readings at six months, before and after the self-reported changes, were assessed for differences, using paired t-test, P < or =0.05 was significant.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline HTN treatment/awareness rates, age-stratified HTN control, number/types of HTN medications used, adherence problems, consultations provided, BP changes in participants who self-reported changes in medication therapy.
AB  - RESULTS: Among 414 participants (averaged 74.2 +/- 8.5 years of age, 34.1% male), baseline HTN rate, awareness rate, and treatment rates were 51.9%, 37.9%, and 24.9%, respectively. Baseline BP worsened with increasing age. Overall, 258 participants received 651 consultations. The most prevalent non-adherent behavior reported was self-adjustment of medication dosing. Among 65 participants who received HTN medication-related advice, 52/65 (80%) reported changes in medication therapy and showed significant improvement in BP at six months before and after the self-report.
AB  - CONCLUSION: HTN awareness/treatment rates were low in the entire population. HTN control was worst among the oldest individuals. Implementing initiation or adjustments in medication therapy can potentially improve BP control.

TI  - Home blood pressure monitoring: a new standard method for monitoring hypertension control in treated patients.
AB  - Inadequate blood pressure (BP) control in patients with treated hypertension can be influenced by patient behavior, the inaccuracy of BP measurement in the clinical setting, and the fact that no single class of medication is universally effective. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) enables accurate measurement of BP and has been recommended (by multiple societies and associations) for the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation of antihypertensive treatment. Although HBPM is thought to improve BP control as a result of patients' increased adherence to their medication, this improvement is limited. Green et al. have shown that HBPM in combination with regular internet correspondence with a medical professional is a highly effective therapeutic strategy for BP control, possibly because this strategy is associated with an increase in number of prescriptions. This strategy should, therefore, be routinely used in the management of patients with hypertension.

TI  - Impact of patient-general practitioner short-messages-based interaction on the control of hypertension in a follow-up service for low-to-medium risk hypertensive patients: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - The evaluation in real-life settings of services for the follow-up and control of hypertensive patients is a complex intervention, which still needs analysis of the roles, tasks, and resources involved in the basic items: patient, healthcare professional, and the interaction between the two. To evaluate the impact of patient-general practitioner (GP) short-messages-based interaction, isolated from other items, on the degree of hypertension control in the follow-up of medium-to-low-risk patients in primary care, a randomized controlled trial has been performed: 38 GPs enrolled 285 hypertensive patients who recorded the results of self-blood-pressure (BP) monitoring, heart rate, and body weight, and completed an optional questionnaire in an identical manner over a six-month period. The telemedicine group (TmG) sent the data to a telemedicine-based system that enabled patient-GP interaction; the control group (CG) recorded the data on paper and could only deliver it to their GP personally in the routine visits. In the TmG, the results were better, but not significantly so, for: 1) degree of hypertension control, in terms of the percentage of uncontrolled hypertensives at the final visit (TmG versus CG: 31.7% versus 35.6%; p = 0.47); 2) reduction in hypertension during follow-up, comparing measurements (performed by a professional) at the initial and final visits of systolic BP (15.5 versus 11.9; p = 0.13) and diastolic BP (9.6 versus 4.4; p = 0.40); and 3) adherence to the protocol within compliance levels of interest in a real-life follow-up service: >>50% (84.8% versus 73.3%) and >>25% (92.4.8% versus 75.4%) ( p = 0.053). Other factors such as average values of self-measured systolic BP, diastolic BP and heart rate, acceptability of the protocol, and median number of consultations and hospital admissions were similar in both groups. Outcomes show that, taken alone, the patient-GP short-messages-based interaction has very little impact on the degree of hypertension control in patients with this profile. In complex interventions, to discriminate the impact of each of its components in isolation will enable us to design an efficient follow-up service, little demanding in terms of healthcare professional dedication, and optimized in other basic aspects.

TI  - Effect of medication burden on persistent use of lipid-lowering drugs among patients with hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of medication burden on persistent use of newly added lipid-lowering (LL) drugs among patients with hypertension.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective database study used medical and pharmacy claims from a mid-Atlantic managed care organization. The cohort was obtained from continuous member enrollment in pharmacy and medical benefits from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2005.
AB  - METHODS: Prescription claims were obtained for 18 months following the date of the first filled LL prescription (ie, index date). Patients were stratified into patients who changed LL drug or strength (group 1) and patients who did not change LL drug or strength (group 2). The primary outcome measure was persistence to newly added LL therapy. Persistence was defined by the length of time a member remained on therapy following the index date. The secondary outcome measure was the medication possession ratio (MPR). The MPR was calculated as the ratio of the sum of the days' supply of prescription filled divided by the number of days filled, plus the days' supply for the final prescription fill. Associations between the daily medication burden, defined as the number of unique drug products, and the outcome measures were analyzed.
AB  - RESULTS: In the cohort of 3058 patients, the mean medication burden was 2.9 medications. Medication burden was positively associated with persistence and MPR through 18 months. Patients who had greater medication burden had longer persistence (P <.001). Likewise, patients who had greater medication burden had higher MPRs and were more likely to be considered adherent (MPR, >80%) (P < .001 for both).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with higher medication burden had greater adherence to newly added LL therapy. Medication burden should not deter clinicians from adding LL therapy. Among patients with added LL therapy, more attention should focus on patients who have changes to their LL regimen compared with patients who continue on the same LL prescription.

TI  - Revision and validation of the medication adherence self-efficacy scale (MASES) in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - Study purpose was to revise and examine the validity of the Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (MASES) in an independent sample of 168 hypertensive African Americans: mean age 54 years (SD = 12.36); 86% female; 76% high school education or greater. Participants provided demographic information; completed the MASES, self-report and electronic measures of medication adherence at baseline and three months. Confirmatory (CFA), exploratory (EFA) factor analyses, and classical test theory (CTT) analyses suggested that MASES is unidimensional and internally reliable. Item response theory (IRT) analyses led to a revised 13-item version of the scale: MASES-R. EFA, CTT, and IRT results provide a foundation of support for MASES-R reliability and validity for African Americans with hypertension. Research examining MASES-R psychometric properties in other ethnic groups will improve generalizability of findings and utility of the scale across groups. The MASES-R is brief, quick to administer, and can capture useful data on adherence self-efficacy.

TI  - Switching to evidence-based once-daily beta-blockers for improved adherence to medication across the continuum of post-myocardial infarction left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.
AB  - Although adherence to evidence-based therapy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes post-myocardial infarction (MI) and in patients with heart failure, adherence remains suboptimal. One method that has demonstrated success in improving adherence is the reduction in the frequency of drug administration (eg, switching from a twice-daily to a once-daily regimen). A once-daily controlled-release (CR) formulation of carvedilol--a beta-blocker used in the treatment of post-MI left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), heart failure, and hypertension--has recently received US approval. This review provides a switching protocol for transitioning stable patients from twice-daily carvedilol to once-daily carvedilol CR. Based on the findings from a head-to-head comparison study of carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate suggesting that carvedilol is associated with superior reductions in mortality and morbidity, physicians may consider switching patients with heart failure receiving beta-blockers who have not shown benefits in this setting. Algorithms are provided for switching patients with heart failure or post-MI LVD from another beta-blocker to carvedilol CR.

TI  - Dietary salt restriction increases plasma lipoprotein and inflammatory marker concentrations in hypertensive patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary salt restriction has been reported to adversely modify the plasma lipoprotein profile in hypertensive and in normotensive subjects. We investigated the effects of the low sodium intake (LSI) on the plasma lipoprotein profile and on inflammation and thrombosis biomarkers during the fasting and postprandial periods.
AB  - METHODS: Non-obese, non-treated hypertensive adults (n=41) were fed strictly controlled diets. An initial week on a control diet (CD, Na=160 mmol/day) was followed by 3 weeks on LSI (Na=60 mmol/day). At admission and on the last day of each period, the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was monitored and blood was drawn after an overnight fasting period and after a fat-rich test meal.
AB  - RESULTS: The dietary adherence was confirmed by 24-h urinary sodium excretion. Fasting triglyceride (TG), chylomicron-cholesterol, hsC-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations, renin activity, aldosterone, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values were higher, but non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were lower on LSI than on CD. For LSI, areas under the curve (AUC) of TG, chylomicron-cholesterol, apoB and the cholesterol/apoB ratio were increased, whereas AUC-NEFA was lowered. LSI did not modify body weight, hematocrit, fasting plasma cholesterol, glucose, adiponectin, leptin, fibrinogen and factor VII (FVII), and AUC of lipoprotein lipase and of lipoprotein remnants.
AB  - CONCLUSION: LSI induced alterations in the plasma lipoproteins and in inflammatory markers that are common features of the metabolic syndrome.

TI  - Impact of electronic monitoring of drug adherence on blood pressure control in primary care: a cluster 12-month randomised controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor long-term adherence is an important cause of uncontrolled hypertension. We examined whether monitoring drug adherence with an electronic system improves long-term blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients followed by general practitioners (GPs).
AB  - METHODS: A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled study was conducted over one year in community pharmacists/GPs' networks randomly assigned either to usual care (UC) where drugs were dispensed as usual, or to intervention (INT) group where drug adherence could be monitored with an electronic system (Medication Event Monitoring System). No therapy change was allowed during the first 2 months in both groups. Thereafter, GPs could modify therapy and use electronic monitors freely in the INT group. The primary outcome was a target office BP<140/90 mmHg.
AB  - RESULTS: Sixty-eight treated uncontrolled hypertensive patients (UC: 34; INT: 34) were enrolled. Over the 12-month period, the likelihood of reaching the target BP was higher in the INT group compared to the UC group (p<0.05). At 4 months, 38% in the INT group reached the target BP vs. 12% in the UC group (p<0.05), and 21% vs. 9% at 12 months (p: ns). Multivariate analyses, taking account of baseline characteristics, therapy modification during follow-up, and clustering effects by network, indicate that being allocated to the INT group was associated with a greater odds of reaching the target BP at 4 months (p<0.01) and at 12 months (p=0.051).
AB  - CONCLUSION: GPs monitoring drug adherence in collaboration with pharmacists achieved a better BP control in hypertensive patients, although the impact of monitoring decreased with time.

TI  - Perindopril for control of blood pressure in patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors: an open-label, observational, multicentre, general practice-based study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hypertension, one of the major treatable cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, usually occurs in association with other major risk factors. As well as providing rapid blood pressure (BP) goal attainment, antihypertensive therapy should also provide reductions in CV events and mortality in a wide range of patients. For this, higher dosages and combinations of antihypertensive agents are often required. ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line agents for control of hypertension in patients with additional CV risk factors. The PEACH (Perindopril's Effect At Controlling Hypertension) study was a community-based study performed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of high-dose perindopril in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and additional risk factors for CV disease.
AB  - METHODS: This was an open-label, multicentre observational study conducted in Canadian general practice clinics. The study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of perindopril given once daily for 10 weeks uptitrated to the maximal recommended dose of perindopril as required for BP control in newly diagnosed or previously treated patients with uncontrolled mild to moderate hypertension and >or=1 additional risk factor. Patients not achieving target BP after 2 weeks of therapy were uptitrated from perindopril 4 mg to perindopril 8 mg once daily. Efficacy endpoints included reduction in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP and BP control. Tolerability assessments included adverse effects and physicians' assessment of tolerability. The number of missed doses was also recorded.
AB  - RESULTS: Overall, 2220 patients with hypertension and >or=1 other risk factor were prescribed perindopril at 291 centres; 51.9% were male, 78.3% Caucasian, 12.8% Asian, 36.2%>or=65 years of age and 34.5% had uncontrolled BP despite previous antihypertensive treatment. Compared with previously treated patients, treatment-naive patients had fewer risk factors, and a higher proportion were Asian (p<0.05 for all comparisons). Most patients (76%) had 1-2 risk factors. Perindopril produced significant SBP/DBP reductions at 2 and 10 weeks (-15.8/-8.0 and -21.1/-11.0 mmHg, respectively). Overall, at week 10, BP control rate was 53.6%, better than at week 2 in the overall cohort and in all subgroups. Uptitration to high-dose perindopril to achieve BP control was required in 46% of patients with one additional risk factor compared with 64% of patients with >or=4 additional risk factors. These results demonstrate that the more risk factors the patient has, the greater the need for high-dose perindopril to achieve BP control. Perindopril was well tolerated as indicated by the high proportion of physicians (95.9%) reporting 'good' to 'excellent' tolerability at week 10.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In this community-based clinical practice trial, up to 10 weeks' perindopril therapy, uptitrated to the maximal recommended dose as required for BP control, significantly reduced SBP/DBP in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and additional CV risk factors. Patients with more risk factors were more likely to require high-dose perindopril.

TI  - Adherence to a Mediterranean-type diet and reduced prevalence of clustered cardiovascular risk factors in a cohort of 3,204 high-risk patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean food pattern (MeDiet) has been suggested to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. Scarcity of assessment of this effect on large samples of patients at high risk is, however, observed. Our objective was to estimate the association between adherence to MeDiet and the prevalence of risk factors in 3,204 asymptomatic high-risk patients.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional assessment of baseline characteristics of participants in a primary prevention trial.
AB  - METHODS: Participants were assessed by their usual primary-care physicians to ascertain the prevalence of diet-related cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or obesity) using standard diagnostic criteria. A dietitian interviewed each participant to obtain a 14-point score measuring the degree of adherence to MeDiet.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence to MeDiet was inversely associated with individual risk factors and, above all, with the clustering of them. The multivariate adjusted odds ratio to present simultaneously the four risk factors for those above the median value of the MeDiet score was 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.85). The multivariate odds ratios for successive categories of adherence to MeDiet were 1 (ref.), 1.03, 0.85, 0.70 and 0.54 (P for trend <0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Following a MeDiet was inversely associated with the clustering of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia among high-risk patients.

TI  - Adherence with single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin vs a two-pill regimen.
AB  - While clinical trials demonstrate the benefits of blood pressure and cholesterol reduction, medication adherence in clinical practice is problematic. We hypothesized that a single-pill would be superior to a 2-pill regimen for achieving adherence. In this retrospective, cohort study based on pharmacy claims data, patients newly initiated on a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or statin simultaneously or within 30 days, regardless of sequence, were followed (N=4703). Adherence was measured over 6 months as proportion of days covered (PDC). At baseline, mean age was 63.0 years, 51.6% were female, and mean number of other medications was 7.8. Overall, 16.9% of patients were on single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin, 15.6% amlodipine + atorvastatin, 24.7% amlodipine + other statin, 13.9% other CCB + atorvastatin, 28.9% other CCB + other statin. Percentages of patients achieving adherence (PDC >or= 80%) were: 67.7% amlodipine/atorvastatin; 49.9% amlodipine + atorvastatin; 40.4% amlodipine + other statin; 46.9% other CCB + atorvastatin; 37.4% other CCB +other statin. After adjusting for treatment selection and cohort differences, odds ratios for adherence with amlodipine/atorvastatin were 1.95 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80-2.13) vs amlodipine + atorvastatin, 3.10 (95% CI, 2.85-3.38) vs amlodipine + other statin, 2.06 (95% CI, 1.89-2.24) vs other CCB + atorvastatin, 2.85 (95% CI, 2.61-3.10) vs other CCB + other statin (all p<0.0001). Single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin may provide clinical benefits through improving adherence, offering clinicians a practical solution for cardiovascular risk management.

TI  - Statin plus ezetimibe treatment in clinical practice: the SI-SPECT (Slovenia (SI) Statin Plus Ezetimibe in Cholesterol Treatment) monitoring of clinical practice study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor results from lipid-lowering therapy are mainly due to inadequate dosing and increased adverse effects with high-dose statin monotherapy or drug combinations.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The SI-SPECT (Slovenia (SI) Statin Plus Ezetimibe in Cholesterol Treatment) study evaluated the effectiveness of either ezetimibe (EZE) 10 mg as monotherapy or co-administered with on-going statin treatment (S + EZE) in clinical practice.
AB  - DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1053 dyslipidaemic patients (52% men, age 60.3 years, 42.9% with CHD, 32.0% with diabetes mellitus and 69.6% with hypertension) were enrolled. The majority (n=986; 93.6%) were treated with EZE as 'add-on' to their already prescribed statin, the rest only received EZE (n=67).
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline lipid levels were compared with those obtained 16 weeks after initiating treatment.
AB  - RESULTS: Total (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), as well as triglycerides (TG) decreased significantly with S + EZE (by 25.3%, 31.4% and 28.9%, respectively; p<0.0001 for all comparisons), while monotherapy with EZE resulted in a decrease of 20.8% for TC (p<0.0001), 28.0% for LDL-C (p<0.0001) and 28.8% for TG (p=0.016). At the end of the study 43.9% of patients achieved target TC (<5.0 mmol/L for primary prevention and <4.5 mmol/L for secondary prevention), 50.5% target LDL-C (<3.0 mmol/L for primary prevention and <2.5 mmol/L for secondary prevention) and 61.6% target TG (<2.0 mmol/L). The overall incidence of adverse effects during the treatment period, and probably related to EZE use, was low (n=6, 0.6% of patients).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: (1) S + EZE combination therapy was effective and safe irrespective of the statin used, (2) the S + EZE combination resulted in significantly more patients reaching their recommended target lipid levels and (3) the lipid-lowering efficacy of EZE in monotherapy as well as of the S + EZE combination was related to initial lipid values. The much greater decrease of TG than expected could be, at least in part, due to better control/compliance regarding diet and drug treatment during the study and adherence to the need for an overnight fast before sampling.

TI  - A practice-based trial of motivational interviewing and adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor medication adherence is a significant problem in hypertensive African Americans. Although motivational interviewing (MINT) is effective for adoption and maintenance of health behaviors in patients with chronic diseases, its effect on medication adherence remains untested in this population.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial tested the effect of a practice-based MINT counseling vs. usual care (UC) on medication adherence and blood pressure (BP) in 190 hypertensive African Americans (88% women; mean age 54 years). Patients were recruited from two community-based primary care practices in New York City. The primary outcome was adherence measured by electronic pill monitors; the secondary outcome was within-patient change in office BP from baseline to 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Baseline adherence was similar in both groups (56.2 and 56.6% for MINT and UC, respectively, P = 0.94). Based on intent-to-treat analysis using mixed-effects regression, a significant time x group interaction with model-predicted posttreatment adherence rates of 43 and 57% were found in the UC and MINT groups, respectively (P = 0.027), with a between-group difference of 14% (95% confidence interval, -0.2 to -27%). The between-group difference in systolic and diastolic BP was -6.1 mm Hg (P = 0.065) and -1.4 mm Hg (P = 0.465), respectively, in favor of the MINT group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A practice-based MINT counseling led to steady maintenance of medication adherence over time, compared to significant decline in adherence for UC patients. This effect was associated with a modest, nonsignificant trend toward a net reduction in systolic BP in favor of the MINT group.

TI  - The design of an observational study of hypertension management, adherence and pressure control in Blood Pressure Success Zone Program participants.
AB  - AIMS: The Blood Pressure Success Zone (BPSZ) Program, a nationwide initiative, provides education in addition to a complimentary trial of one of three antihypertensive medications. The BPSZ Longitudinal Observational Study of Success (BPSZ-BLISS) aims to evaluate blood pressure (BP) control, adherence, persistence and patient satisfaction in a representative subset of BPSZ Program participants. The BPSZ-BLISS study design is described here.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 20,000 physicians were invited to participate in the study. Using a call centre supported Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS), physicians report BP and other data at enrolment and every usual care visit up to 12 +/- 2 months; subjects self-report BPs, persistence, adherence and treatment satisfaction at 3, 6 and 12 months post-BPSZ Program enrolment. In addition to BPSZ Program enrolment medications, physicians prescribe antihypertensive medications and schedule visits as per usual care. The General Electric Healthcare database will be used as an external reference.
AB  - RESULTS: After 18 months, over 700 IRB approved physicians consented and enrolled 10,067 eligible subjects (48% male; mean age 56 years; 27% newly diagnosed); 97% of physicians and 78% of subjects successfully entered IVRS enrolment data. Automated IVRS validations have maintained data quality (< 5% error on key variables). Enrolment was closed 30 April 2007; study completion is scheduled for June 2008.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of large-scale health education programmes requires innovative methodologies and data management and quality control processes. The BPSZ-BLISS design can provide insights into the conceptualisation and planning of similar studies.

TI  - Blood pressure control among treated hypertensives in a tertiary health institution.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Goal blood pressure (BP) was defined by the JNC VI and the World Health Organization-International Society of Hypertension (WHO/ISH) as <140 mm Hg systolic and <90 mm Hg diastolic for the general and <130 mm Hg systolic and <85 mm Hg diastolic for special high-risk populations. It is well established that adequate BP control characterizes only a fraction of treated hypertensive patients. The importance of tight BP control has been established in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
AB  - METHODS: We performed cross-sectional studies on the current status of BP control among treated hypertensive in our center. One hundred consecutive patients with essential hypertension who have been attending the out patient hypertension clinic and have been on treatment for at least 6 months were recruited. The pre treatment BP and BP records in the previous 2 visits were noted. Patients were said to have good BP control if their BPs are < 140/90 mmHg (<130/80 mmHg for high risk patients) at the time of the study and in the last visit.
AB  - RESULTS: There were 49 males and 51 female (M: F; 1:1), aged 26 to 85 (mean 52.33 +/- 12.29) years. The duration of hypertension ranged 6 months to 30 (mean 7.37 +/- 7.1) years. The duration of treatment in our centre was 6 months to 10 (mean 3.22 +/- 2.23) years. Blood pressure was controlled in 33 (33%) of the patients. Pre-treatment mean blood pressure was significantly higher than the BP value at the time of the study (155.87 +/- 26.02/97.81 +/- 11.89 mmHg versus 143.40 +/- 24.14/86.53 +/- 12.71 mmHg) (p<0.05). Diuretics were the commonest antihypertensive prescribed either alone or in combination (69%), followed by a calcium antagonist (56%) and centrally acting drugs (38%). Twenty seven were on single antihypertensive, 43 (43%) on 2, 25(25%) on 3 and 5 (5%) on 4 classes of antihypertensive. Blood pressure control was associated with taking more than one antihypertensive medication and compliance.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Control of BP in patients receiving antihypertensive drugs is still far from optimal in the study population in Nigeria just as in other countries. Many patients had multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Adherence to medication should be encouraged.

TI  - Impact of disease management on utilization and adherence with drugs and tests: the case of diabetes treatment in the Florida: a Healthy State (FAHS) program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of telephonic care management within a diabetes disease management program on adherence to treatment with hypoglycemic agents, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), statins, and recommended laboratory tests in a Medicaid population.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 2,598 patients with diabetes enrolled for at least 2 years in Florida: A Healthy State (FAHS), a large Medicaid disease management program, who received individualized telephonic care management were selected if they were eligible for at least 12 months before and 12 months after beginning care management. Patients were matched one-to-one on all baseline characteristics to 2,598 control patients. The impact of care management on utilization and adherence rates for diabetes-related medications and tests was analyzed with the difference-in-difference estimator.
AB  - RESULTS: Changes in utilization were evaluated separately for those who were characterized as adherent to treatment at baseline ("users") and those who were not ("nonusers"). Both groups achieved significant improvement in adherence between baseline and follow-up. Nonusers increased their overall hypoglycemic use by 0.7 script (P < 0.001), by 0.7 script for ACEIs and statins (both P < 0.001), by 0.8 test for A1C (P < 0.001), and by 0.7 test for lipids (P < 0.001). Users increased hypoglycemic use by 1.5 scripts (P < 0.001) and insulin use by 0.9 script (P < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The FAHS telephonic care management intervention effectively induced Medicaid patients with diabetes to begin treatment and improved adherence to oral hypoglycemic agents and recommended tests. It also substantially improved adherence among baseline insulin users.

TI  - Effects of strict blood pressure control by a long-acting calcium channel blocker on brain natriuretic peptide and urinary albumin excretion rate in Japanese hypertensive patients.
AB  - Strong adherence to antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce the frequency of cardiovascular events by strictly controlling blood pressure. Although calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are among the most popular antihypertensive drugs in Japan, few trials have been conducted using high CCB doses in Japanese patients. In this study, we administered amlodipine 5 mg or 10 mg to patients with hypertension in order to compare the efficacy and tolerability of low and high doses, and measured two surrogate markers of hypertensive target organ damage, i.e., brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a risk marker of cardiac overload and microalbuminuria as a measure of renal damage. Seventy-two patients were randomly assigned to either amlodipine 5 mg (n = 35) or 10 mg (n = 37) dose groups. The latter group achieved greater reductions in clinic as well as both morning and evening home BP levels without an increase in pulse rate (the differences between the two groups in clinic/morning/evening systolic BP were 4.7/4.7/5.4 mmHg, and for diastolic BP they were 4.2/3.6/3.8 mmHg). Reductions in BNP and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UAR) levels were significantly correlated with the reductions in systolic BP levels (BNP, clinic/morning BP: r = 0.256, p = 0.030/r = 0.330, p = 0.005; UAR, clinic BP: r = 0.316, p = 0.007). In conclusion, the higher dose (10 mg) of amlodipine induced greater reductions in all BP levels than did the lower dose, without increasing the pulse rate. These additional reductions were significantly correlated with reductions in hypertensive cardiac overload, as evaluated by BNP levels, and a reduction in renal damage, as evaluated by microalbuminuria levels. Moreover, a reduction in the microalbuminuria may have occurred concomitant with a reduction in clinic systolic BP level.

TI  - Cohort study of medication adherence in older adults (CoSMO): extended effects of Hurricane Katrina on medication adherence among older adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research indicates that many patients with hypertension ran out of medications and had difficulties getting refills immediately after Hurricane Katrina. The extended effect of Hurricane Katrina on antihypertensive medication adherence is not well characterized.
AB  - METHODS: Data were analyzed for 2194 participants who completed the baseline survey for the Cohort Study of Medication Adherence among Older Adults between August 2006 and September 2007. Based on pre-Katrina zip codes, the study population was categorized into high- and low-affected areas. Low medication adherence was defined as a score less than 6 on the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale.
AB  - RESULTS: Prevalence of low adherence was similar among participants living in high and low affected areas. Low medication adherence was similar for participants with greater than or less than 25% of the residence damaged by Hurricane Katrina and for participants with and without symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. In high affected areas, nonsignificant associations were present for those who had moved since the storm and those with a friend or immediate family member who had died in the month after the storm. These factors were not associated with low medication adherence in low affected areas. In both high- and low-affected areas, lower scores on the hurricane coping self-efficacy scale were associated with low medication adherence (P < 0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The effect of Hurricane Katrina on patient adherence to antihypertensive medication was limited in the second year after the storm. Intrinsic patient factors, such as low coping self-efficacy, remain important factors associated with low adherence.

TI  - The effect of clinical characteristics and dietary habits on the relationship between education status and 5-year incidence of cardiovascular disease: the ATTICA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to investigate whether clinical characteristics and dietary habits influence the association between education status and 5-year incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
AB  - METHODS: From 2001 to 2002, 1,514 men and 1,528 women (>18 year) without known CVD were enrolled. In 2006, the 5-year follow-up was performed (31% participants were lost to follow-up). Development of fatal or non-fatal CVD (coronary heart disease, acute coronary syndromes, stroke, or other CVD) was defined according to WHO-ICD-10 criteria. Education status was measured in years of school, while baseline dietary habits were assessed through a semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (EPIC-Greek). The Mediterranean-Diet-Score was applied to assess overall adherence to this pattern using scores of 11 food-variables and alcohol, according to the principles of the Mediterranean-diet.
AB  - RESULTS: The 5-year incidence of CVD was 108 (11.0%) cases in men and 62 (6.1%) cases in women (P < 0.001); 32 (1.6%) of these events were fatal (21 in men). People in the low education group had significantly higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemias, were more likely to be sedentary and smokers, compared to high group. Moreover, compared to high, people in low education group had less healthy dietary habits, as assessed using the diet score (P < 0.001). Multi-adjusted analysis revealed that low education was positively associated with 5-year incidence of CVD, after adjusting for age and sex (HR = 1.64; 95%CI 1.05-2.55); however this association lost its significance when clinical characteristics and dietary habits were taken into account (HR = 1.31; 95%CI 0.63-2.74).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Low education seems to increase CVD risk, an observation that was partially explained by baseline clinical characteristics and unhealthy dietary choices of people belonging into this group.

TI  - [The knowledge, attitude and practice of blood pressure management from the patient's viewpoint: a qualitative study]. [Korean]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study adopted a qualitative method to explore the layman's beliefs and experience concerning high blood pressure and its management in order to develop a strategy to increase adherence to proper medical treatment.
AB  - METHODS: Semi-structured interviews that focused on personal experiences with hypertension and its management were conducted with 26 hypertensive patients. The participants were selected according to a BP above 140/90 mmHg (hypertension stage 1), based on the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on prevention, detection, evaluation and treatment of high blood pressure (JNC-VII). The interviews lasted for approximately 30 minutes (range: 20-60 minutes). The resulting questions were formulated into open-ended questions. The interview questionnaire was composed 17 items to examine non-adherence to treatment and 19 items to examine adherence to treatment.
AB  - RESULTS: Most participants recognized that the direct cause of high blood pressure was unhealthy behavior rather than inheritance. Thus, the hypertensive patient believed they could recover their blood pressure to a normal level through removing the direct cause of hypertension (weight reduction, diet, exercise) instead of taking drugs. The reasons for these statements were that the drugs for controlling hypertension are not natural or they are artificial, and they may have side effects, and drugs are not treatment for the root cause of hypertension. Most of the hypertensive patients chose to manage their behaviors as soon as they knew their blood pressure was high. Therefore, we should not divide the subjects into two groups according to their taking drugs or not, but they should be divided into two groups according to their willingness or not to manage their condition.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: For developing a strategy for an individual approach to hypertension management, we need to develop a client-centered attitude and strategy. That is, we need to tailor our approach to individual cases to avoid generalizations and stereotyping when developing an adherence increasing strategy.

TI  - Exercise on Prescription. Effect of attendance on participants' psychological factors in a Danish version of Exercise on Prescription: a study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In many countries exercise prescriptions are used to facilitate physical activity in a sedentary population with or in risk of developing lifestyle diseases. Some studies show a positive effect of exercise prescription on specific lifestyle diseases. Others only show moderately positive or no effect on physical activity level. Furthermore, the challenge is adherence of participants to a physically active lifestyle on a long term basis after intervention. Therefore, it is essential for offering successful prescribed interventions aiming towards behaviour change to focus on psychological and social issues as well as physiological issues. The aim of this study is to assess the short and long term development of psychological conditions in two different Exercise on Prescription groups; The Treatment Perspective and The Preventive Perspective behaviour. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the design used.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The Treatment Perspective involves a 16 week supervised training intervention including motivational counselling. The Preventive Perspective only involves motivational counselling. The study is an evaluation of best practice and is accomplished by the use of a combination of quantitative (collected by questionnaires) and qualitative (collected by the use of semi structured interviews) measures. Comparison of The Treatment Perspective and The Preventive Perspective are performed at baseline and after 16 months. Development within the groups is measured at 4, 10, and 16 months. Self-reported measures describe physical activity, health-related quality of life, compliance with national guidelines for physical activity, physical fitness, self-efficacy, readiness to change, decisional balance, and processes of change. To elaborate self-efficacy, readiness to change, decisional balance, and processes of change, these issues were elucidated by interviews.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This study of best practice is designed to provide information about important psychological concepts in relation to behaviour change and physical activity. The study is part of a health technology assessment of Exercise on Prescription, which apart from the psychological concepts (the patient's perspective) covers the effectiveness, the organization, and the health economy.

TI  - Adherence treatment factors in hypertensive African American women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension among African American women is of epidemic proportions. Nonadherence to treatment contributes to uncontrolled blood pressure in this population. Factors associated with adherence to treatment in African American women are unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with adherence to hypertension treatment in African American women.
AB  - METHODS: Five audio-taped focus groups were conducted with hypertensive African American women, 35 years and older receiving treatment for hypertension from an inner-city free clinic. All transcripts from the tapes were analyzed for content describing adherence to treatment factors.
AB  - FINDINGS: factors associated with adherence to treatment in hypertensive african american women were in three main categories including: beliefs about hypertension, facilitators of adherence to treatment, and barriers to adherence to treatment.
AB  - IMPLICATIONS: The study supports the need for education on managing hypertension and medication side effects, early screening for depression in hypertensive African Americans, development of culturally sensitive hypertension educational material, and formation of support groups for promoting adherence to treatment among African American women with hypertension.

TI  - Integration of depression and hypertension treatment: a pilot, randomized controlled trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: We wanted to examine whether integrating depression treatment into care for hypertension improved adherence to antidepressant and antihypertensive medications, depression outcomes, and blood pressure control among older primary care patients.
AB  - METHODS: Older adults prescribed pharmacotherapy for depression and hypertension from physicians at a large primary care practice in West Philadelphia were randomly assigned to an integrated care intervention or usual care. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to assess depression, an electronic monitor to measure blood pressure, and the Medication Event Monitoring System to assess adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: In all, 64 participants aged 50 to 80 years participated. Participants in the integrated care intervention had fewer depressive symptoms (CES-D mean scores, intervention 9.9 vs usual care 19.3; P <.01), lower systolic blood pressure (intervention 127.3 mm Hg vs usual care 141.3 mm Hg; P <.01), and lower diastolic blood pressure (intervention 75.8 mm Hg vs usual care 85.0 mm Hg; P <.01) compared with participants in the usual care group at 6 weeks. Compared with the usual care group, the proportion of participants in the intervention group who had 80% or greater adherence to an antidepressant medication (intervention 71.9% vs usual care 31.3%; P <.01) and to an antihypertensive medication (intervention 78.1% vs usual care 31.3%; P <.001) was greater at 6 weeks.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A pilot, randomized controlled trial integrating depression and hypertension treatment was successful in improving patient outcomes. Integrated interventions may be more feasible and effective in real-world practices, where there are competing demands for limited resources.

TI  - CRISTOPH - a cluster-randomised intervention study to optimise the treatment of patients with hypertension in General Practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines for the management of hypertension focus on treating patients according to their global cardiovascular risk (CVR), rather than strictly keeping blood pressure, or other risk factors, below set limit values. The objective of this study is to compare the effect of a simple versus a complex educational intervention implementing this new concept among General Practitioners (GPs).
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal cluster-randomised intervention trial with 94 German GPs consecutively enroling 40 patients each with known hypertension. All GPs then received a written manual specifically developed to transfer the global concept of CVR into daily General Practice. After cluster-randomisation, half of the GPs additionally received a clinical outreach visit, with a trained peer discussing with them the concept of global CVR referring to example study patients from the respective GP. Main outcome measure is the improvement of calculated CVR six months after intervention in the subgroup of patients with high CVR (but no history of cardiovascular disease), defined as 10-year-mortality > or = 5% employing the European SCORE formula. Secondary outcome measures include the intervention's effect on single risk factors, and on prescription rates of drugs targeting CVR. All outcome measures are separately studied in the three subgroups of patients with 1. high CVR (defined as above), 2. low CVR (SCORE < 5%), and 3. a history of cardiovascular disease. The influence of age, sex, social status, and the perceived quality of the respective doctor-patient-relation on the effects will be examined.
AB  - DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, no other published intervention study has yet evaluated the impact of educating GPs with the goal to treat patients with hypertension according to their global cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Physician adherence to blood pressure guidelines and its effect on seniors.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare physician adherence to guidelines from the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure for patients younger than 65 years of age with those aged 65 years and older, and to analyze whether factor groupings (subsets of criteria used to determine adherence) were predictive of blood pressure control.
AB  - DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review.
AB  - SETTING: Five university-affiliated family medicine and internal medicine outpatient clinics.
AB  - PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-nine patients (age range 21-85 yrs) with uncontrolled hypertension: 105 patients were younger than 65 years (nonsenior), and 74 patients were 65 years or older (senior).
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data abstracted from each patient's medical record were used to evaluate adherence to 17 process-of-care criteria, identified to assess physician adherence to the guidelines. A computer algorithm generated scores for each criterion as well as an overall adherence score. The relationship between the adherence score and blood pressure control was then examined. Separate factor analyses were conducted to ascertain differences in the way that the criteria were grouped. Factor scores were calculated for each patient, and the scores were evaluated in the context of blood pressure control. Guideline adherence scores were significantly higher for nonsenior patients than for senior patients (59.3% vs 56.1%, p=0.024). Blood pressure control rate was also higher, although not significantly, in nonseniors versus seniors (68.6% vs 56.8%, p=0.063). No factors in the senior group were significantly associated with blood pressure control, but one was significantly correlated in the nonsenior group (p<0.0001). It included diuretic therapy, adjusting a drug when a patient's blood pressure was uncontrolled, documentation of uncontrolled blood pressure in the medical record at the visit, documentation of the correct blood pressure goal, documentation of cardiovascular risk factors, and measurement of urine albumin level.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Overall physician adherence to blood pressure guidelines was significantly higher for the nonsenior group than for the senior group. Similarly, control of blood pressure was better in the nonsenior group. However, no significant relationship between overall adherence scores and blood pressure control was found in either group. In nonseniors, one factor grouping was significantly correlated with blood pressure control. Future studies should evaluate the process-of-care criteria to determine if and how they are related to blood pressure control in senior patients.

TI  - Partial adherence to antihypertensive therapy fails to achieve full cardiovascular benefits in hypertensive rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Partial adherence to antihypertensive therapy remains a public health challenge and may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. We quantitatively evaluated cardiovascular risk inherent in partial therapy adherence in spontaneously hypertensive rats with accelerated hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Adult spontaneously hypertensive rats were divided into 5 groups; Group 1 (controls) did not receive any treatment, whereas all other rats (Groups 2-5) were given nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) to exacerbate hypertension. Group 2 (untreated/nonadherers) was given L-NAME but not antihypertensive medication; Group 3 (Perfect Adherers) was treated daily with candesartan (10 mg/kg); Group 4 was given candesartan 3 times a week, whereas Group 5 received candesartan only during the last 6 days of the 3-week experiment (Partial Adherers). At the end, indices of systemic and regional (kidneys, brain, and heart) hemodynamics, and indices of left ventricular function were determined.
AB  - RESULTS: Treatment with L-NAME aggravated hypertension, adversely affected target organ blood flows and resistances, and grossly impaired ventricular function. Perfect adherence with candesartan completely reversed the adverse cardiovascular effects of L-NAME intervention. In partial adherers (Groups 4 and 5), arterial pressure decreased and reached control values. However, target organ hemodynamics and heart function showed only slight improvements, if any.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that partial adherence to therapy reduces arterial pressure, but may not prevent target organ damage. If replicated in humans, these results may have important clinical implications in hypertensive patients.

TI  - Adiponectin plasma levels are increased by atorvastatin treatment in subjects at high cardiovascular risk.
AB  - Adiponectin can suppress atherogenesis by inhibiting the adherence of monocytes, reducing their phagocytic activity, and suppressing the accumulation of modified lipoproteins in the vascular wall. Contradictory data have been reported about the effect of statins on adiponectin plasma levels. In this work, adiponectin plasma levels were measured in 102 statin-free subjects from the Spanish population of the Achieve Cholesterol Targets Fast with Atorvastatin Stratified Titration (ACTFAST) study, a 12-week, prospective, multi-centre, open-label trial which enrolled subjects with coronary heart disease, coronary heart disease-equivalent or a 10-year coronary heart disease risk >20%. Subjects were assigned to atorvastatin (10-80 mg/day) based on low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentration at screening. For comparison, age and gender-matched blood donors (N=40) were used as controls. Control subjects did not present hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and history of cardiovascular diseases. Adiponectin levels were diminished in patients at high cardiovascular risk compared with control subjects [4166 (3661-4740) vs 5806 (4764-7075) ng/ml respectively; geometric mean (95% CI); P<0.0001]. In the whole population, atorvastatin treatment increased adiponectin levels [9.7 (3.2-16.7);% Change (95% CI); P=0.003]. This increment was in a dose-dependent manner; maximal effect observed with atorvastatin 80 mg/d [24.7 (5.7-47.1); P=0.01]. Adiponectin concentrations were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol both before and after atorvastatin treatment. No association was observed between adiponectin and LDL-cholesterol before and after atorvastatin treatment. In conclusion, atorvastatin increased adiponectin plasma levels in subjects at high cardiovascular risk, revealing a novel anti-inflammatory effect of this drug.

TI  - Amlodipine reduces the antimigratory effect of diclofenac in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
AB  - Amlodipine, an antihypertensive drug, and diclofenac, an antiinflammatory drug, may generally be combined, particularly in elderly patients; therefore, the potential for their interaction is high. We aim to determine if amlodipine interferes with the antimigratory effect of diclofenac. For this, male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were treated with either diclofenac (1 mg.kg.d, 15 d) alone or combined with amlodipine (10 mg.kg.d, 15 d). Leukocyte rolling, adherence, and migration were studied by intravital microscopy. Diclofenac did not change (180.0 +/- 2.3), whereas amlodipine combined (163.4 +/- 5.1) or not (156.3 +/- 4.3) with diclofenac reduced the blood pressure (BP) levels in SHR (183.1 +/- 4.4). Diclofenac and amlodipine reduced leukocyte adherence, migration, and ICAM-1 expression, whereas only diclofenac reduced rolling leukocytes as well. Combined with amlodipine, the effect of the diclofenac was reduced. Neither treatment tested increased the venular shear rate or modified the venular diameters, number of circulating leukocytes, P-selectin, PECAM-1, L-selectin, or CD-18 expressions. No difference could be found in plasma concentrations of both drugs given alone or in association. In conclusion, amlodipine reduces leukocyte migration in SHR, reducing endothelial cell ICAM-1 expression. Amlodipine reduces the effect of the diclofenac, possibly by the same mechanism. A pharmacokinetic interaction as well as an effect on the other adhesion molecules tested could be discarded.

TI  - Adherence to prescribed antihypertensive drug treatments: longitudinal study of electronically compiled dosing histories.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of dosing history in patients prescribed a once a day antihypertensive medication.
AB  - DESIGN: Longitudinal database study.
AB  - SETTING: Clinical studies archived in database for 1989-2006.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Patients who participated in the studies whose dosing histories were available through electronic monitoring.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Persistence with prescribed antihypertensive treatment and execution of their once a day drug dosing regimens.
AB  - RESULTS: The database contained dosing histories of 4783 patients with hypertension. The data came from 21 phase IV clinical studies, with lengths ranging from 30 to 330 days and involving 43 different antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin II receptor blockers (n=2088), calcium channel blockers (n=937), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n=665), beta blockers (n=195), and diuretics (n=155). About half of the patients who were prescribed an antihypertensive drug had stopped taking it within one year. On any day, patients who were still engaged with the drug dosing regimen omitted about 10% of the scheduled doses: 42% of these omissions were of a single day's dose, whereas 43% were part of a sequence of several days (three or more days-that is, drug "holidays"). Almost half of the patients had at least one drug holiday a year. The likelihood that a patient would discontinue treatment early was inversely related to the quality of his or her daily execution of the dosing regimen.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Early discontinuation of treatment and suboptimal daily execution of the prescribed regimens are the most common facets of poor adherence with once a day antihypertensive drug treatments. The shortfalls in drug exposure that these dosing errors create might be a common cause of low rates of blood pressure control and high variability in responses to prescribed antihypertensive drugs.

TI  - [Current situation of hypertensive patients over 75 years old: the DISEHTAE study]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess in patients over 75 years old the degree of their compliance with recommendations on follow-up, control and treatment of hypertension.
AB  - DESIGN: Descriptive, multi-centre study, covering the whole of Spain.
AB  - SETTING: A total of 107 health centres from 14 autonomous communities.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Hypertensive patients over 75: 1,369 clinical charts. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN MEASUREMENTS: The variables studied were: age and sex, place monitored, blood pressure figures, screening for, and diagnosis of diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, smoking, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and obesity. Blood creatinine, proteinuria, prescribed medication, and infrastructure variables were also included.
AB  - RESULTS: The most often screened cardiovascular risk factor (CRF) was obesity (76.1%), whilst the most prevalent was hypercholesterolaemia (31.3%). Of the patients, 25.5% had associated diabetes and 48.5% had a body mass index (BMI) >25. Low microalbuminuria (8.4%) was found. The proportion of patients with their blood pressure controlled was higher among those monitored in primary care (32.8%) than out of primary care (23.2%). No drug treatment was prescribed for 7.9%, only hygiene-dietary measures. The most common pharmacological group was that of the diuretics, followed by IECAS and ARA II.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Though we can say that the degree of control of hypertension in elderly patients is steadily increasing, it is still far from optimal in most of our patients.

TI  - Inpatient initiation of beta-blockade plus nurse management in vulnerable heart failure patients: a randomized study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Predischarge beta-blocker initiation in hospitalized patients with heart failure due to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is safe and improves adherence; improved outcomes with this approach have not been demonstrated in a randomized trial. This study compared 6-month rehospitalization rates among patients assigned to predischarge beta-blockade coupled with postdischarge nurse management (intervention) versus usual care.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomized 64 patients with an LVEF </=0.40 to low-dose carvedilol coupled with nurse management or usual care. The nurse manager saw patients within 2 weeks of discharge, then biweekly until stable. Baseline characteristics reflected a vulnerable population (80% uninsured, 72% minorities, 80% unemployed or disabled), as did heart failure etiology (28% substance abuse, 27% ischemic, 19% hypertension, 17% idiopathic). Mean baseline LVEF was 0.23 in both groups. Among intervention patients at 6 -months, beta-blocker utilization was higher (96 vs. 48%, P < .001), mean New York Heart Association class improved (-1.44 vs. -0.77, P = .01), and total heart failure rehospitalizations were reduced by 84% (3 vs. 19, P = .02). A trend toward improved LVEF was also observed (+16 vs. +11 units, P = .17).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Inpatient beta-blocker initiation coupled with nurse management improved outcomes among sociodemographically disadvantaged heart failure patients. Our results support a practice shift toward inpatient beta-blocker initiation with structured outpatient follow-up.

TI  - Predictors of participant adherence and retention in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension.
AB  - The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) was conducted over a 7-year period at 21 clinical centers across the United States to investigate whether one of two levels of blood pressure control and/or one of three classes of antihypertensive medications was more effective at slowing the rate of renal disease in African Americans with renal insufficiency presumed secondary to hypertension. Analysis at the end of the study revealed an overall participant retention rate of 90% (still alive and not on dialysis); defined as having had at least one 125I-iothalamate GFR, the primary data collection element, measured in the final year of the study. Adherence, defined as not missing 3 consecutive protocol visits (6 months) during the study, was 77%. Adherence to protocol visits showed that participants assigned to a low blood pressure goal (mean arterial pressure [MAP] of 92 mm/Hg or lower) had a 30% (95% CI, 9%-45%) lower risk of nonadherence as compared to those assigned to the usual goal [MAP of 102-107] (p = 0.006). No statistically significant difference was observed between randomized drug assignments. Higher baseline systolic (p = 0.0001) and diastolic (p = 0.007) blood pressures were associated with a higher risk of nonadherence. Declining to provide an annual income is associated with a higher risk of nonadherence compared to those with incomes of $15,000 or higher (p = 0.04). In discussing the identifying factors that may predict nonadherence and the strategies that assisted in improving adherence and retention, this article offers insights for researchers in achieving high levels of participation in long-term clinical studies.

TI  - Predictive validity of a medication adherence measure in an outpatient setting.
AB  - This study examines the psychometric properties and tests the concurrent and predictive validity of a structured, self-reported medication adherence measure in patients with hypertension. The authors also assessed various psychosocial determinants of adherence, such as knowledge, social support, satisfaction with care, and complexity of the medical regimen. A total of 1367 patients participated in the study; mean age was 52.5 years, 40.8% were male, 76.5% were black, 50.8% graduated from high school, 26% were married, and 54.1% had income <$5,000. The 8-item medication adherence scale was reliable (alpha=.83) and significantly associated with blood pressure control (P<.05). Using a cutpoint of <6, the sensitivity of the measure to identify patients with poor blood pressure control was estimated to be 93%, and the specificity was 53%. The medication adherence measure proved to be reliable, with good concurrent and predictive validity in primarily low-income, minority patients with hypertension and might function as a screening tool in outpatient settings with other patient groups.

TI  - Bromide as marker for drug adherence in hypertensive patients.
AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: Insufficient drug adherence is an important reason for inadequate blood pressure control. Currently, methods that measure drug adherence objectively are lacking. Objective methods are needed to help improve blood pressure control and outcome in hypertensive patients.
AB  - WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Potassium bromide added to antihypertensive drugs can be used to monitor drug adherence in individual patients. However, although this method is objective, it is rather time-, cost- and work-consuming. AIMS Adherence to antihypertensive medication is essential for adequate long-term control of blood pressure (BP). This study investigated different methods of measuring adherence in hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: Patients were included if BP was insufficiently controlled on monotherapy. After a placebo period patients were treated with trandolapril 2 mg/verapamil SR 180 mg (TV). BP was determined using a mercury sphygmomanometer and ambulatory BP monitoring. Adherence was measured by capsule counting, electronic registration of pill-box openings and by measuring serum bromide concentrations. Potassium bromide was added to each TV capsule.
AB  - RESULTS: Thirty patients participated in the study. Treatment with TV significantly lowered office BP and ambulatory BP. Results for electronic monitoring and adherence based on bromide measurements were comparable. Adherence was slightly higher when assessed by capsule counting.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Measuring serum bromide concentrations may be suitable for assessment of adherence to drug therapy giving comparable results to electronic monitoring. Using capsule counting, electronic monitoring and measurement of bromide concentrations, nonadherent patients were identified.

TI  - Why don't diabetes patients achieve recommended risk factor targets? Poor adherence versus lack of treatment intensification.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of effective hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia therapies, target levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c), and hemoglobin A1c control are often not achieved.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relative importance of patient medication nonadherence versus clinician lack of therapy intensification in explaining above target cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor levels.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional assessment.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: In 2005, 161,697 Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult diabetes patients were included in the study.
AB  - MEASUREMENT: "Above target" was defined as most recent A1c >/=7.0% for hyperglycemia, LDL-c >/=100 mg/dL for hyperlipidemia, and SBP >/=130 mmHg for hypertension. Poor adherence was defined as medication gaps for >/=20% of days covered for all medications for each condition separately. Treatment intensification was defined as an increase in the number of drug classes, increased dosage of a class, or a switch to a different class within the 3 months before or after notation of above target levels.
AB  - RESULTS: Poor adherence was found in 20-23% of patients across the 3 conditions. No evidence of poor adherence with no treatment intensification was found in 30% of hyperglycemia patients, 47% of hyperlipidemia patients, and 36% of hypertension patients. Poor adherence or lack of therapy intensification was evident in 53-68% of patients above target levels across conditions.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Both nonadherence and lack of treatment intensification occur frequently in patients above target for CVD risk factor levels; however, lack of therapy intensification was somewhat more common. Quality improvement efforts should focus on these modifiable barriers to CVD risk factor control.

TI  - Patients' perceptions of electronic monitoring devices affect medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic monitoring devices (EMDs) are regarded as the gold standard for assessing medication adherence in clinical research. However, little is known about the effect of patients' acceptance of EMDs on medication adherence in African Americans with hypertension who are followed in primary care practices
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess patients' perceptions of EMDs, their acceptance of EMDs, and the relationship of these perceptions to medication adherence in African Americans with hypertension who are followed in community-based practices.
AB  - METHODS: Patients were recruited from a larger randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of motivational interviewing on medication adherence and blood pressure in hypertensive African American patients followed in 2 New York City primary care practices. Medication adherence was assessed with a Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) during a 12-month monitoring period. At the 12-month follow-up, patients' perceptions of the MEMS were assessed with a 17-item questionnaire. ANOVA was used to compare patients' responses (agree, neither, disagree) with the MEMS adherence over the monitoring period. Tukey's post hoc tests were used to determine whether there were significant differences among the 3 groups.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants were predominantly women, low-income, unemployed, had a high school education, and were a mean age of 53 years. Approximately two-thirds of the participants stated that the MEMS helped them remember to take their medications, 93% reported that the MEMS was easy to open, 85% did not find it stressful, and 75% liked the MEMS and used it everyday. One-third of patients preferred using a pillbox and 25% did not like traveling with the MEMS. Patients who stated that they used the MEMS every day, felt comfortable using it in front of others, and remembered to put refills in the MEMS had significantly better adherence over the study period than did those who disagreed (p </= 0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: African American patients treated for hypertension in community-based practices held positive perceptions about a MEMS. Perceptions about the practicality of a MEMS may yield important information about actual medication-taking behavior.

TI  - Electronic communications and home blood pressure monitoring (e-BP) study: design, delivery, and evaluation framework.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have provided unequivocal evidence that treatment of hypertension decreases mortality and major disability from cardiovascular disease; however, blood pressure remains inadequately treated in most affected individuals. This large gap continues despite the facts that more than 90% of adults with hypertension have health insurance, and hypertension is the leading cause of visits to the doctor. New approaches are needed to improve hypertension care.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Electronic Communications and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (e-BP) study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether care based on the Chronic Care Model and delivered over the Internet improves hypertension care. The primary study outcomes are systolic, diastolic, and blood pressure control; secondary outcomes are medication adherence, patient self-efficacy, satisfaction and quality of life, and healthcare utilization and costs.
AB  - METHODS: Hypertensive patients receiving care at Group Health medical centers are eligible if they have uncontrolled blood pressure on two screening visits and access to the Web and an e-mail address. Study participants are randomly assigned to three intervention groups: (a) usual care; (b) home blood pressure monitoring receipt and proficiency training on its use and the Group Health secure patient website (with secure e-mail access to their healthcare provider, access to a shared medical record, prescription refill and other services); or (c) this plus pharmacist care management (collaborative care management between the patient, the pharmacist, and the patient's physician via a secure patient website and the electronic medical record).
AB  - CONCLUSION: We will determine whether a new model of patient-centered care that leverages Web communications, self-monitoring, and collaborative care management improves hypertension control. If this model proves successful and cost-effective, similar interventions could be used to improve the care of large numbers of patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - A cluster randomized trial to evaluate physician/pharmacist collaboration to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - This was a prospective, cluster randomized controlled trial in patients with uncontrolled hypertension aged 21 to 85 years (mean, 61 years). Pharmacists made recommendations to physicians for patients in the intervention clinics (n=101) but not patients in the control clinics (n=78). The mean adjusted difference in systolic blood pressure (BP) between the control and intervention groups was 8.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4-12.9), while the difference in diastolic BP was 5.4 mm Hg (CI, 2.8-8.0) at 9 months. The 24-hour BP levels showed similar effects, with a mean systolic BP level that was 8.8 mm Hg lower (CI, 5.0-12.6) and a mean diastolic BP level that was 4.6 mm Hg (CI, 2.4-6.8) lower in the intervention group. BP was controlled in 89.1% of patients in the intervention group and 52.9% in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 8.9; CI, 3.8-20.7; P<.001). Physician/pharmacist collaboration achieved significantly better mean BP values and overall BP control rates, primarily by intensification of medication therapy and improving patient adherence.

TI  - Improving hypertension control in diabetes mellitus: the effects of collaborative and proactive health communication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Communication between patients and clinicians using collaborative goals and treatment plans may overcome barriers to achieving hypertension control in routine diabetes mellitus care. We assessed the interrelation of patient-clinician communication factors to determine their independent associations with hypertension control in diabetes care.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 566 older adults with diabetes mellitus and hypertension at the DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston, Tex. Clinical and pharmacy data were collected, and a patient questionnaire was sent to all participants. A total of 212 individuals returned surveys. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the effect of patient characteristics, self-management behaviors, and communication factors on hypertension control. Three communication factors had significant associations with hypertension control. Two factors, patients' endorsement of a shared decision-making style (odds ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 2.57) and proactive communication with one's clinician about abnormal results of blood pressure self-monitoring (odds ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 3.26), had direct, independent associations in multivariate regression. Path analysis was used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of communication factors and hypertension control. Decision-making style (beta=0.20, P<0.01) and proactive communication (beta=0.50, P<0.0001) again demonstrated direct effects on hypertension control. A third factor, clinicians' use of collaborative communication when setting treatment goals, had a total effect on hypertension control of 0.16 (P<0.05) through its direct effects on decision-making style (beta=0.28, P<0.001) and proactive communication (beta=0.22, P<0.01).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Three communication factors were found to have significant associations with hypertension control. Patient-clinician communication that facilitates collaborative blood pressure goals and patients' input related to the progress of treatment may improve rates of hypertension control in diabetes care independent of medication adherence.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure-lowering effects of valsartan and enalapril after a missed dose in previously untreated patients with hypertension: a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 3 days a month, some 15% to 20% of patients with hypertension do not recall having taken their antihypertensive medication. Individuals with this frequency of missed doses may be at increased risk for a cardiovascular event and may have a poorer long-term prognosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to compare the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of valsartan and enalapril over the 24 hours after missing 1 dose in previously untreated patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, blinded end-point trial in previously untreated patients (age >18 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension (European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology guidelines: systolic BP 140-179 mm Hg or diastolic BP 90-109 mm Hg). Patients were randomly assigned to receive 16 weeks of treatment with valsartan 160 mg/d or enalapril 20 mg/d, taken on waking. ABPM was conducted for 48 consecutive hours at baseline and again after 16 weeks of therapy. Patients took a dose of their assigned treatment at the beginning of the final session of ABPM and were instructed to skip the next daily dose.
AB  - RESULTS: The study enrolled 148 Spanish patients (84 men, 64 women; mean [SD] age, 45.8 [10.7] years) with previously untreated hypertension. At the end of treatment, there were significant differences between groups during the first 24 hours of ABPM, starting in the final 6 hours of the dosing interval (P < 0.001). There was no significant change in BP reduction between the first and second 24-hour periods of ABPM with valsartan (-2.1/-1.4 mm Hg), whereas enalapril was associated with a significant increase in BP over this period (5.5/3.8 mm Hg; P < 0.001 vs first 24 hours; P = 0.032 vs valsartan).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this study in previously untreated patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, valsartan was associated with a sustained BP-lowering effect beyond the initial 24 hours after dosing, whereas enalapril was not. There was no significant change in the efficacy of valsartan in the 24 hours after a missed dose. At the doses tested, valsartan was more effective than enalapril, both during active treatment and after a missed dose.

TI  - Self-efficacy and self-management behaviors in patients with chronic kidney disease.
AB  - Although past research has examined self-management among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), little is known about self-management in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this cross-sectional survey (no intervention), 174 patients with CKD (serum creatinine > or =1.7 mg/dL) completed self-reported measures of self-efficacy, physical and mental functioning, and self-management. The purpose of the study was to explore the association between patients' perceived self-efficacy and their self-management behaviors. Five types of self-management behaviors were measured: communication with caregivers, partnership in care, self-care, self-advocacy, and medication adherence. Controlling for other relevant variables including age, education, diabetic status, hypertension, serum creatinine, physical functioning, and mental health functioning, higher perceived self-efficacy scores were associated with increased communication, partnership, self-care, and medication-adherence behaviors. In this study, patients' perceived self-efficacy was a more consistent correlate of self-management behavior than were demographic or health characteristics. Because self-management has been associated with positive patient outcomes, fostering self-management by supporting patient self-efficacy may have long-term benefits.

TI  - How Ghanaian, African-Surinamese and Dutch patients perceive and manage antihypertensive drug treatment: a qualitative study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore and compare how Ghanaian, African-Surinamese (Surinamese), and White-Dutch patients perceive and manage antihypertensive drug treatment in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
AB  - METHODS: Qualitative study was conducted using detailed interviews with a purposive sample of 46 hypertensive patients without comorbidity who were prescribed antihypertensives.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients in all the ethnic groups actively decided how to manage their prescribed antihypertensive regimens. In all the groups, confidence in the doctor and beneficial effects of medication were reasons for taking prescribed antihypertensive dosage. Particularly, ethnic-minority patients reported lowering or leaving off the prescribed medication dosage. Explanations for altering prescribed dosage comprised disliking chemical medications, fear of side effects and preference for alternative treatment. Surinamese and Ghanaian men also worried about the negative effects of antihypertensives on their sexual performance. Some Ghanaians mentioned fear of addiction or lack of money as explanations for altering prescribed dosage. Surinamese and Ghanaians often discontinued medication when visiting their homeland. Some respondents from all ethnic groups preferred natural treatments although treatment type varied.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients' explanations for their decisions regarding the use of antihypertensives are often influenced by sociocultural issues and in ethnic-minority groups also by migration-related issues. Self-alteration of prescribed medication among Surinamese and Ghanaians may contribute to the low blood pressure (BP) control rate and high rate of malignant hypertension reported among these populations in the Netherlands. This study provides new information, which can help clinicians to understand how patients of diverse ethnic populations think about managing antihypertensive drug treatment and to address ethnic disparities in medication adherence and BP control.

TI  - Take Control of Your Blood Pressure (TCYB) study: a multifactorial tailored behavioral and educational intervention for achieving blood pressure control.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluating a randomized controlled trial involving a tailored behavioral intervention conducted to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: Adults with hypertension from two outpatient primary care clinics were randomly allocated to receive a nurse-administered behavioral intervention or usual care. In this ongoing study, patients receive the tailored behavioral intervention bi-monthly for 2 years via telephone; the goal of the intervention is to promote medication adherence and improve hypertension-related health behaviors. Patient factors targeted in the tailored behavioral intervention include perceived risk of hypertension and knowledge, memory, medical and social support, patients' relationship with their health care provider, adverse effects of medication therapy, weight management, exercise, diet, stress, smoking, and alcohol use.
AB  - RESULTS: The sample randomized to the behavioral intervention consisted of 319 adults with hypertension (average age=60.5 years; 47% African-American). A comparable sample of adults was assigned to usual care (n=317). We had a 96% retention rate for the overall sample for the first 6 months of the study (93% at 12 months). The average phone call has lasted 18min (range 2-51min). From baseline to 6 months, self-reported medication adherence increased by 9% in the behavioral group vs. 1% in the non-behavioral group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention is easily implemented and is designed to enhance adherence with prescribed hypertension regimen. The study includes both general and patient-tailored information based upon need assessment. The study design ensures internal validity as well as the ability to generalize study findings to the clinic settings.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Despite knowledge of the risks and acceptable evidence, a large number of hypertensive adults still do not have their blood pressure under effective control. This study will be an important step in evaluating a tailored multibehavioral intervention focusing on improving blood pressure control.

TI  - Importance of therapy intensification and medication nonadherence for blood pressure control in patients with coronary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of blood pressure (BP) control in secondary prevention, a significant proportion of patients with coronary disease have uncontrolled BP.
AB  - METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of patients with coronary disease (N = 10 447) evaluated the impact of medication nonadherence and therapy intensification on reaching target BP goals. Medication adherence was calculated as the proportion of days covered for filled prescriptions of antihypertensive medications. Therapy intensification included dosage increase or increase in number of antihypertensive medications. The primary outcome was uncontrolled systolic BP (SBP) over time, using a latent class model that incorporated longitudinal SBP data and assigned patients to SBP trajectory groups. Multivariable regression evaluated the association between medication nonadherence (ie, proportion of days covered, <0.80) and therapy intensification with SBP control over time, with adjustment for demographics and clinical characteristics.
AB  - RESULTS: Three SBP trajectory groups were identified: (1) patients with BP that remained controlled (ie, SBP, <or=140 mm Hg) over time (n = 9114 [87.2%]); (2) patients with high BP that became controlled (n = 779 [7.5%]); and (3) patients with BP that remained high over time (n = 554 [5.3%]). In multivariable analyses, therapy intensification (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.70) and medication nonadherence (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-2.24) were associated with uncontrolled BP compared with high SBP that became controlled over time.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that medication nonadherence can help explain why BP levels remained elevated despite intensification of antihypertensive medications. Successful BP control is seen with a combination of intensification and adherence, suggesting that therapy intensification must be coupled with interventions to enhance medication adherence.

AB  - Interprofessional care may provide some answers to the challenge of scarce healthcare resources, through the utilization of the expertise of various professionals to improve evidence-based care. This was a two-year programme in primary care, where doctor and nurse pairs acted as intrinsic facilitators creating and implementing local guidelines and encouraging multiprofessional teamwork. The effect of implementation was studied by auditing professional opinion change, blood pressure, serum lipid and HbA1C levels. After one year, 20 health stations reported improvement in treatment practices of hypertension and the division of tasks across team members, and seven and eight health stations reported improvement in treatment of diabetes and dyslipidemia. After two years, the corresponding figures were 29, 25 and 22, respectively. Active guidance to home measurements increased from 90% to 100% and every health station identified a dedicated area for patient self-measurement. At baseline, in poor control were 17% of blood pressure measurements, and 31% of diabetic and 71% of dyslipidemic patients. At follow-up, the corresponding figures were 22%, 34% and 64%, respectively. Multiprofessional facilitation and learning proved to be effective in implementing guidelines, improving multiprofessional collaboration and sharing duties and responsibilities, as well as targeting preventative activities and resources adequately.

TI  - Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents in a 2-year follow-up: insufficient adherence to diabetes centers.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To study the 2-year course of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in general practice to present (1) the treatment modalities, (2) patient adherence, and (3) the occurrence of comorbidities.
AB  - METHODS: HBA1c, lipids, blood pressure, treatment modalities, occurrence of retinopathy and nephropathy were analyzed in 129 children and adolescents with T2DM (median age 13.4 years, 75% female) in specialized diabetes centers in Germany.
AB  - RESULTS: Seventy-eight (60%) children dropped out of care after a mean of 7.1 months. Drug treatment was not stopped in any of the 64 children initially treated with antidiabetic drugs. Sixteen (12%) children were treated solely by lifestyle intervention over the 2-year course. In the 51 children with complete follow-up, median HbA1c was 7.7% at diagnosis and 6.3% after 2 years. Less than 5% of all children were treated with antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs, while 65% suffered from hypertension and 44% from dyslipidemia. Over the course of the disease, retinopathy was not observed, while microalbuminuria occurred in 25%.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In general practice, many children and adolescents with T2DM were lost of follow-up. Lifestyle intervention as sole treatment was not often useful for long-term metabolic control. Dyslipidemia and hypertension were seldom treated as recommended.Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Variables affecting the change in systemic blood pressure in response to nasal CPAP in obstructive sleep apnea patients.
AB  - We hypothesized that an improvement in systemic blood pressure (BP) during continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) would be related to severity of hypertension (HTN), morphometric parameters such as body mass index, and level of CPAP adherence. We tested this hypothesis with a retrospective review of 85 consecutive OSA patients who had completed diagnostic and CPAP titration polysomnograms and were equipped with a CPAP-adherence monitoring system for a minimum of 1 month of observation. Sphygmomanometer-obtained BP readings were compared at baseline and after 4-6 weeks of CPAP therapy. Presentation BP was significantly and strongly associated with the change in BP seen with treatment. Those with an elevated systolic and diastolic BP and those with an elevation of either systolic or diastolic BP showed a significant fall in BP on CPAP. Those with a BP below the hypertensive range of 140/90 on presentation did not have a significant drop in BP with CPAP. There were no significant changes in systolic, diastolic, or mean BP when patients were categorized by the severity of HTN, as determined by the number of antihypertensive medications prescribed or if they were categorized by the degree of CPAP adherence, objectively determined by the average use of more or less than 4 h/night. We conclude that HTN at initial presentation is among the most important indicators of potential benefit of CPAP administration on BP.

TI  - Impact of medication packaging on adherence and treatment outcomes in older ambulatory patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate medication adherence and treatment outcomes in elderly outpatients using daily-dose blister packaging (Pill Calendar) compared with medications packaged in bottles of loose tablets.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Ambulatory care clinics at Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus; University of Arizona Health Science Center, Tucson; and Riverside Methodist Hospital Family Medicine Clinic, Columbus, Ohio, from July 1, 2002, to December 31, 2004.
AB  - PATIENTS: 85 individuals 65 years of age or older being treated with lisinopril for hypertension.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive lisinopril in either daily-dose blister packaging (Pill Calendar) or traditional bottles of loose tablets.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence was assessed by prescription refill regularity and medication possession ratio (MPR). Treatment outcome and use of medical services were assessed by medical record review of blood pressure and morbidity associated with poorly controlled hypertension.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients receiving lisinopril in the daily-dose blister packaging (Pill Calendar) refilled their prescriptions on time more often (P = 0.01), had higher MPRs (P = 0.04), and had lower diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.01) than patients who had their medications packaged in traditional bottles of loose tablets.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Providing medications in a package that identifies the day each dose is intended to be taken and provides information on proper self-administration can improve treatment regimen adherence and treatment outcomes in elderly patients.

TI  - Effect of pharmaceutical care programme on blood pressure and quality of life in a Nigerian pharmacy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aimed at evaluating the effect of pharmaceutical care programme on blood pressure and quality of life of patients who visit a Nigerian community pharmacy.
AB  - METHOD: A non-randomised, single-site, crossover design was used. Patients served as their own control. They underwent 5 months of usual care and another 5 months of pharmaceutical care.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Blood pressure and quality of life measured before implementation of pharmaceutical care and at the end served as main outcome measures. Other end-points assessed at baseline and at the end of investigation included smoking cessation, adherence to therapy, exercise, salt restriction, alcohol moderation and self blood pressure measurement.
AB  - RESULTS: Twenty four (24) patients out of the 40 recruited completed the study. Mean reductions were significant after pharmaceutical care intervention for systolic BP (14.3+/-14.4 mmHg) and diastolic BP (10.8+/-10.7 mmHg). There was a significant mean increase in number of patients that adhered to salt restriction (-36%), aerobic exercise (-46%), self BP measurement (-46%), alcohol moderation (-33%) and drug adherence (-16.7%). There was a positive increase of -11.4 and -3.2 for physical health and social health domain of quality of life evaluation respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Pharmaceutical care programme could produce a beneficial effect on hypertensive patients.

TI  - Community-based weight management in long-term heart transplant recipients: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart transplant recipients often suffer from obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension thought to be related to triple-drug immunosuppression and poor adherence to diet and exercise. A lifestyle intervention that allows recipients to attend a community-based weight management program may improve health outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine (1) the effects of attending a community-based weight management program on weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the lipid profile; and (2) the feasibility of a community-based program for weight management.
AB  - METHODS: Twenty-one patients (81% male; age 57 years, 99.7 months since transplantation) participated in a randomized clinical trial and received either weight management counseling (control) or a 6-month scholarship to a structured commercial program (treatment). Using simple analysis of covariance models, group differences were assessed and reported as marginal means.
AB  - RESULTS: At baseline, there were no demographic differences between groups. There were no differences in outcome variables except weight (control, 102.1 kg vs treatment, 98.3 kg; P= .05). After 6 months, significant differences were found in weight (control, 100.5 kg vs treatment, 95.6 kg; P= .047) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (control, 40.6 mg/dL vs treatment, 49.1 mg/dL; P= .044). A marginally significant difference was found in systolic blood pressure (control, 138 mm Hg vs treatment, 121 mm Hg; P= .07). A decrease in diastolic blood pressure (6 mm Hg) was attributed to treatment effect (P = .16). No differences were noted in total cholesterol, triglycerides, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The structured commercial program appears to be an effective, feasible alternative to usual care. Findings need to be confirmed in future research with a larger sample.

TI  - Can combining different risk interventions into a single formulation contribute to improved cardiovascular disease risk reduction? The single pill of amlodipine/atorvastatin. [Review] [67 refs]
AB  - In order to prevent cardiovascular events, it is essential to effectively manage overall risk of cardiovascular disease. However, despite guideline recommendations to this effect, current management of the major, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia is disconnected and patient adherence to therapy is poor. This is particularly important for patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, who are often prescribed multiple medications. The JEWEL study program investigated the use of single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin as a strategy to improve management of these patients. The JEWEL program consisted of two 16-week, international, open-label, multicenter, titration-to-goal studies in patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. The two studies differed based on country of enrollment and certain tertiary endpoints, but the overall designs were very similar. Patients were enrolled from 255 centers across Canada and 13 European countries. The study was designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and utility of amlodipine/atorvastatin single-pill therapy in a real-world setting. Patients were initiated at a dose of amlodipine 5 mg/atorvastatin 10 mg, unless previously treated, and were uptitrated as necessary. The primary efficacy parameter was the percentage of patients, at different levels of cardiovascular risk, achieving country-specific guideline-recommended target levels for blood pressure and lipids. A secondary analysis of efficacy measured attainment of the same single goal for blood pressure across all study participants (JEWEL I and II) and the same single goal for LDL-C across all study participants (JEWEL I and II). The program utilized a newly developed questionnaire to gain better understanding of participants' beliefs and behaviors towards medical treatment of their multiple risk factors. Approximately 2850 patients were enrolled in the program, which was completed in August 2005. The JEWEL program assessed the effectiveness of a single pill (amlodipine/atorvastatin) in targeting the two principal risk factors for cardiovascular disease simultaneously to achieve nationally applicable treatment targets in a routine clinical practice setting.

TI  - Electronic pillboxes (MEMS) to assess the relationship between medication adherence and blood pressure control in primary care.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between blood pressure and medication adherence using electronic pillboxes (MEMS).
AB  - SETTING: Five general practices in Bristol, UK.
AB  - SUBJECTS: A total of 239 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of hypertension and being prescribed at least one blood pressure-lowering medication. Participants were asked to use the electronic pillbox as their drug bottle for at least one month.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: "Timing adherence" (correct inter-dose intervals) as measured through MEMS and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) office blood pressure.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) timing adherence was 88% (+/-17),>80% in 175 (73%), and less than 50% in 11 (5%) participants. Adherence was monitored for a mean of 33 (+/-6) days. Mean (+/-SD) SBP was 147.9+/-19.1 mmHg and DBP 82.3+/-10.1 mmHg. There was no evidence to suggest that timing adherence was associated with SBP or DBP (overall correlation coefficients -0.01 and -0.02 respectively). According to current guidelines, about one in four of all participants had controlled SBP (only 6% of diabetic patients). DBP was under control in 66% of the individuals.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: No relationship between adherence and blood pressure in patients with hypertension recruited from primary care was found. Average timing adherence measured by electronic monitors was high (88%) and blood pressure was controlled in a minority of patients. Our findings suggest that in terms of poor blood pressure control pharmacological non-response to or insufficient intensity of blood pressure-lowering medication might be more important than poor adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy.

TI  - The effect of combination therapy with an L/N-Type Ca(2+) channel blocker, cilnidipine, and an angiotensin II receptor blocker on the blood pressure and heart rate in Japanese hypertensive patients: an observational study conducted in Japan.
AB  - Recently, the use of combination therapy with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) has been rapidly increasing. Although this combination therapy is accepted as a standard treatment hypertension, there have been few large-scale, multicenter studies examining its safety and efficacy. The present study was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of adding cilnidipine, a dual L/N-type CCB, to the regimen of patients whose blood pressure had been poorly controlled (systolic blood pressure [SBP] >140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >90 mmHg) by antihypertensive monotherapy with an ARB. The percentage achievement of the blood pressure goals recommended by the JSH 2000 guidelines was also assessed for at least 12 weeks of treatment. A total of 2,920 patients were enrolled in the study at 471 institutions in Japan from February 2003 to July 2004. The incidence of adverse reactions related to cilnidipine was as low as 2.5%. A significant reduction from the baseline was found both in SBP (from 164.1 +/- 15.3 to 139.2 +/- 15.3 mmHg, p<0.0001) and DBP (from 91.7 +/- 11.4 to 79.3 +/- 10.7 mmHg, p<0.0001). A total of 31.5% of the patients achieved the blood pressure goals recommended by the JSH 2000 guidelines. Moreover, the heart rate also significantly decreased in these patients, particularly in those with a higher baseline heart rate. Our results indicate that cilnidipine can be used in combination with an ARB to control blood pressure without any significant adverse effects, and also that cilnidipine successfully reduces elevated heart rate, which is a possible risk factor for cardiovascular events.

TI  - Renal-protective effect of T-and L-type calcium channel blockers in hypertensive patients: an Amlodipine-to-Benidipine Changeover (ABC) study.
AB  - Both strict blood pressure control and efferent artery dilatation are critical in reducing proteinuria, which in turn helps to regulate blood pressure. Benidipine, an L- and T-type calcium channel blocker, has the potential for increased effectiveness compared with L-type-dominant calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine. Therefore, we evaluated blood pressure and proteinuria after changeover from amlodipine to benidipine in poorly controlled hypertensive patients. Fifty-eight hypertensive outpatients undergoing amlodipine treatment and unable to achieve optimal blood pressure as determined by Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertention (JSH 2004) were changed over to benidipine treatment. We measured blood pressure and pulse rate and assessed urinary protein excretion before and after changeover. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure dropped from 151/90 mmHg to 140/81 mmHg (p<0.0001). Mean blood pressure (p<0.0001) and pulse pressure (p=0.0069) were also reduced, but pulse rate increased from 75 bpm to 78 bpm (p=0.0047). Urinary protein excretion adjusted for urinary creatinine was reduced from 0.35 +/- 0.82 to 0.22 +/- 0.55 g/g creatinine (p=0.0119). The urinary protein reduction was observed only in patients with renin-angiotensin inhibition (p=0.0216). By switching from amlodipine to benidipine treatment, more than 80% of patients reduced their blood pressure, and more than 40% achieved optimal blood pressure. Higher urinary protein excretion (p<0.0001), lower glomerular filtration rate (p=0.0011) and presence of diabetes (p=0.0284) were correlated with reduction of urinary proteins during changeover. Taken together, our results suggest that benidipine may have greater efficacy than amlodipine in reducing blood pressure and proteinuria.

TI  - Side effects of combination therapy of peginterferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis-C.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to elucidate the side effects after combination therapy of peginterferon and ribavirin for Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C.
AB  - METHODS: Inclusion criteria were HCV-genotype 1b and serum HCV RNA level of > 100 KIU/ml. Six hundred and twelve patients were received combination therapy and enrolled in this non-randomized prospective cohort study. Patients were monitored until the discontinuation of combination therapy based on treatment-related side effects. The percentage of each medication actually taken during treatment was calculated.
AB  - RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were stopped the combination therapy due to side effects. The cumulative discontinuation rate due to side effects of therapy was 8.4% at 0.5 year and 14.9% at one year. Discontinuation rate due to side effects was high with statistically significant in the following cases: 1) patients > or = 65 years, 2) patients who had diabetes. Sustained viral response (SVR) was 17.6% (12/68) in the discontinuation group. In the discontinuation group, when the percentage of both peginterferon and ribavirin actually taken during treatment was > or = 60%, SVR was 31% (9/29). On the other hand, when the percentage of each medication actually taken during treatment was < 60%, SVR was 7.7% (3/39). In the discontinuation group, patients with adherence of > 60% to the total of scheduled dose tended to have a high SVR compared to those with < or = 60% adherence to the total of scheduled dose.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In combination therapy, patient age and complications of patient are important factors contributing to the safety. In the discontinuation group, patients with adherence of > 60% to the total of scheduled dose tend to have a high SVR.

TI  - Effect of general practitioner education on adherence to antihypertensive drugs: cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a simple educational package for general practitioners on adherence to antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Six randomly selected communities in Karachi, Pakistan.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 200 patients with hypertension taking antihypertensive drugs; 78 general practitioners.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Care by general practitioners specially trained in management of hypertension compared with usual care.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correct dosing, defined as percentage of prescribed doses taken, measured with electronic medication event monitoring system (MEMS) bottle.
AB  - RESULTS: 200 patients were enrolled, and 178 (89%) successfully completed six weeks of follow-up. Adherence was significantly greater in the special care group than in the usual care group (unadjusted mean percentage days with correct dose 48.1%, 95% confidence interval 35.8% to 60.4%, versus 32.4%, 22.6% to 42.3%; P=0.048). Adherence was also higher among patients who had higher levels of education (P<0.001), were encouraged by family members (P<0.001), believed in the effect of drugs (P<0.001), and had the purpose of the drugs explained to them (P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Special training of general practitioners in management of hypertension, emphasising good communication between doctors and patients, is more effective than usual care provided in the communities in Karachi. Such simple interventions should be adopted by other developing countries that are now facing an increasing burden of hypertension.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of IDAS II, a new electronic device enabling drug adherence monitoring.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate clinically the acceptability of the IDAS II (Intelligent Drug Administration System), a new electronic device that enables drug adherence monitoring.
AB  - METHODS: IDAS II was compared to another electronic monitor, the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) in a randomised two-way cross-over study involving 24 hypertensive patients treated with irbesartan. Patients used each device for 2 months. The main parameter of evaluation was the patients' opinion on both devices. Rates of adherence and blood pressure were also assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: Most patients considered both devices to be reliable reminders (IDAS II: 75%;MEMS: 84%, p = ns). Ten patients (42%) preferred the MEMS, while 11 (46%) preferred the IDAS II; three (12%) expressed no preference. Patients found the MEMS device easier to use than the IDAS device (p < 0.001) but appreciated the IDAS blister packs better than the MEMS bulk packaging (p < 0.01). Over the 4-month period, the median "taking adherence" was excellent (99.2%) and comparable with both devices. However, the regularity of drug intake timing was higher with the IDAS II (p < 0.01).
AB  - CONCLUSION: IDAS II, a new electronic device enabling drug adherence monitoring without reconditioning of the drugs appears to be a well-accepted device. Overall, practicability and acceptability of the IDAS II and the MEMS device were similar. Thus, IDAS II could be a useful tool for the management of long-term therapies.

TI  - Randomized controlled trials of positive affect and self-affirmation to facilitate healthy behaviors in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases: rationale, trial design, and methods.
AB  - Secondary prevention of adverse outcomes in patients with cardiopulmonary disease requires that patients become actively engaged in self-management efforts such as participation in physical activity or medication adherence. However, despite assiduous efforts to find strategies that help cardiovascular patients to adopt and maintain such behaviors, many studies of interventions designed to improve physical activity and adherence to medication have shown disappointing results. To this end, the Translational Behavioral Science Research Consortium was created by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to identify promising, but underutilized findings from basic behavioral science that might have potential application for translation to clinical populations where behavioral change has been refractory to standard intervention approaches. This paper describes the rationale and methods of a novel research project designed to test the efficacy of a behavioral intervention that combines constructs from two behavioral science theories (positive affect and self-affirmation) in order to help patients with coronary artery disease, asthma, and hypertension successfully change behaviors. The project consists of an intervention framed upon positive affect and self-affirmation and tested in three concurrent randomized controlled trials among three distinct populations. Each trial had a qualitative phase that served as a formative stage to inform the intervention; a pilot phase during which the feasibility of the intervention was tested and refined; and a randomized controlled phase conducted to investigate the effects of the interventions in these three patient groups.

TI  - Adherence in glaucoma: objective measurements of once-daily and adjunctive medication use.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine with electronic monitoring an objective measurement of adherence in two populations of subjects: those using once-daily prostaglandin analogs as sole ocular hypotensive therapy (one-drug group) and those requiring an adjunctive medicine to the prostaglandin analog (two-drug group).
AB  - DESIGN: Single-site, open-label, nonrandomized, parallel design of 60 days.
AB  - METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive adult subjects with a diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension: 31 were taking one drug and 31 were taking two drugs. An electronic event medication monitoring device was used to record each bottle opening. The main outcome measures were dosing errors (number of under-adherence or over-adherence events) and coverage (proportion of pharmacologic duration covered by dosing) relative to the ophthalmologist-prescribed regimen.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence to the prostaglandins once daily was good in both groups by all measures (<or=10% of subjects with more than five dosing errors and mean coverage of 97.2% +/- 6.1%). Adherence to the second medication in the two-drug group was poorer (37% of subjects with more than five dosing errors and mean coverage of 85.6% +/- 12.6%). For the subjects using beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, 24.8% +/- 18.4% of doses were taken at less than 10-hour intervals (over-adherence).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of a time component in electronic monitoring provides more information than prescription refill rate or other methods. We found that more complex dosing regimens result in poorer adherence, although once-daily drugs in a complex dosing regimen were found to have good adherence.

TI  - A nurse-led cardiac rehabilitation programme improves health behaviours and cardiac physiological risk parameters: evidence from Chengdu, China.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a cardiac rehabilitation programme on health behaviours and physiological risk parameters in patients with coronary heart disease in Chengdu, China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies indicate a dose-, level- and duration-dependent relationship exists between cardiac behavioural and physiological risks and coronary heart disease incidence as well as subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality. Cardiac risk factor modification has become the very primary goal of modern cardiac rehabilitation programmes.
AB  - DESIGN METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Coronary heart disease patients (n = 167) who met the sampling criteria in two tertiary medical centres in Chengdu, south-west China, were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (the cardiac rehabilitation programme) or control group (the routine care). The change of health behaviours (walking performance, step II diet adherence, medication adherence, smoking cessation) and physiological risk parameters (serum lipids, blood pressure, body weight) were assessed to evaluate the programme effect.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly better performance in walking, step II diet adherence, medication adherence; a significantly greater reduction in serum lipids including triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein; and significantly better control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at three months. The majority of these positive impacts were maintained at six months. The effect of the programme on smoking cessation, body weight, serum high-density lipoprotein, was not confirmed.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A cardiac rehabilitation programme led by a nurse can significantly improve the health behaviours and cardiac physiological risk parameters in coronary heart disease patients. Nurses can fill significant treatment gaps in the risk factor management of patients with coronary heart disease.
AB  - RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study raises attention regarding the important roles nurses can play in cardiac rehabilitation and the unique way for nurses to meet the rehabilitative care needs of coronary heart disease patients. Furthermore, the hospital-home bridging nature of the programme also created a model for interfacing the acute care and community rehabilitative care.

TI  - Effect of pharmaceutical care on blood pressure control and health-related quality of life in patients with resistant hypertension.
AB  - PURPOSE: Verification of whether pharmacotherapeutic follow-up improves arterial blood pressure (BP) was conducted, and whether this improvement alters the quality of life of patients with resistant hypertension in a university teaching hospital in Brazil was determined.
AB  - METHODS: A prospective survey of 44 patients was carried out over a period of 20 months. Each patient was followed up for 12 months. Pharmaceutical care was assessed using the following methods: measurement of the office BP and ambulatory BP monitoring, adherence to therapy, drug-related problems, and the use of health care facilities (urgent care visits and hospital admissions). The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients was also assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and a physical symptoms profile.
AB  - RESULTS: The majority (95.5%) of patients adhered to the treatment throughout the study, and there was a significant reduction in BP (p < 0.05). Nearly all of the domains of HRQOL assessed by SF-36 remained unchanged during the follow-up except for a significant improvement in social functioning (p = 0.041). There was a significant reduction in moderate and severe physical symptoms (p = 0.005). There were also significant reductions in the number of urgent care visits (p = 0.0001) and hospital admissions (p = 0.006).
AB  - CONCLUSION: The pharmaceutical care provided by a pharmacist in an ambulatory care clinic in Brazil improved BP, adherence to antihypertensive medications, and the social functioning of patients with resistant hypertension.

TI  - The PREMIER intervention helps participants follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary pattern and the current Dietary Reference Intakes recommendations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of the PREMIER study lifestyle interventions on dietary intakes and adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI).
AB  - DESIGN: An 18-month multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing two multicomponent lifestyle intervention programs to an advice only control group.
AB  - SUBJECTS/SETTING: A total of 810 participants were recruited from local communities and randomized into the study. Individuals were eligible if they were aged 25 years or older, had body mass index between 18.5 and 45.0, not taking antihypertensive medication, and had prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure 120 to 159 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 80 to 95 mm Hg).
AB  - INTERVENTION: The two active intervention programs were a behavioral lifestyle intervention that implements established recommendations, and an established intervention plus the DASH dietary pattern. Both interventions consisted of intensive group and individual counseling sessions. The control group received a brief advice session after randomization and again after 6 months of data collection. Dietary intakes were collected by two random 24-hour recalls at baseline, 6 months, and 18 months.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of the PREMIER study was change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months. The main outcomes examined here include dietary variables collected by 24-hour recall at each time point.
AB  - STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Nutrient intakes were calculated and compared among the time points and the three intervention groups using mixed models with repeated measures at 6 and 18 months. Proportion of participants who met or achieved the original DASH nutrient intake levels and the DRIs were calculated and compared among the three intervention groups. P<0.01 was considered statistically significant.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants in both the established intervention and established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern groups substantially reduced energy, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium intake and these reductions persisted throughout the study. Established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern group participants increased intakes of fruits, vegetables, dairy, and many vitamins and minerals; these increases were significantly greater than that of the control and established intervention groups. A majority of established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern group participants achieved at least two thirds of the DRI recommendations for most nutrients at 6 months, despite their reduction in total energy intake. Some but relatively small recidivism occurred at 18 months.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Both the established intervention and established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern group intervention were effective in helping participants follow established recommendations to control blood pressure. The advice-only control group also made some behavior changes, mainly decreasing energy and sodium intake. Only the established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern group significantly increased intakes of DASH-specific food groups, including fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, and nutrients, including protein, fiber, calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Most of the increases did not reach the levels consumed in the original DASH feeding studies. Whereas the established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern group intervention provides a useful platform to achieve the DASH dietary pattern and current DRI recommendations, intervention enhancements, including a greater emphasis on nutrient-dense foods, would likely improve this intervention.

TI  - Factors which may influence cardiovascular disease in dialysis and transplant patients--blood pressure (chapter 10).
AB  - Many renal units still fail to return blood pressure data to the Renal Registry. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, the percentage of HD patients achieving the combined blood pressure standard (<140/90 pre-dialysis) averages 43% (inter unit range 16-60%) and post-dialysis (<130/80) average 48% (range 22-66%). On average 27% (range 12-48%) of PD patients achieve the standard of <130/80 and 26% of renal transplant patients (range 16-40%). Over the last 8 years there has been no significant change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure achievement. Better comorbidity data returns are required by the Registry to perform blood pressure survival analyses.

TI  - Does knowledge matter?: intentional medication nonadherence among middle-aged Korean Americans with high blood pressure.
AB  - AIM: To examine predictors of intentional and unintentional nonadherence to antihypertensive medication regimens and their relationships to blood pressure outcomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although poor adherence to medical regimens is a major concern in the care of patients with high blood pressure (HBP), our understanding of the complex behavior related to adherence is limited. Moreover, few studies have been devoted to understanding adherence issues in ethnic minority groups, such as the interplay between cultural beliefs and HBP medication-taking behaviors.
AB  - DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis was performed to assess the factors affecting nonadherence to antihypertensive medication regimens.
AB  - METHODS: The data used in this analysis came from an ongoing HBP intervention trial involving middle-aged (40-64 years) Korean Americans with HBP. A total of 445 Korean Americans with HBP was enrolled in the trial at baseline. Of these, 208 participants who were on antihypertensive medication were included in the analysis. Using multivariate logistic regression, we examined theoretically selected variables to assess their relationships to intentional and unintentional nonadherence in this sample.
AB  - RESULTS: Approximately 53.8% of the subjects endorsed 1 or more types of nonadherent behaviors. After controlling for demographic variables, multivariate analysis revealed that a greater number of side effects from the medication (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07 to 1.33) and a lower level of HBP knowledge (adjusted OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.99) were significantly associated with intentional nonadherence. Unintentional nonadherence was less strongly associated with the study variables examined in the analysis.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that intentional nonadherence to antihypertensive medication that stems from incomplete knowledge of HBP treatment is prevalent among middle-aged Korean Americans with HBP. The results highlight the strong need for an intervention that focuses on increasing patient knowledge about HBP, including the benefits and side effects of antihypertensive medication. This type of focused intervention may help reduce intentional nonadherence to antihypertensive medications and ultimately result in achieving adequate BP control in this high-risk group.

TI  - Medication adherence and health care costs with the introduction of latanoprost therapy for glaucoma in a Medicare managed care population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Latanoprost, a prostaglandin inhibitor, is increasingly being used in the therapeutic management of glaucoma. However, there is scant literature examining the cost and outcome ramifications of latanoprost.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the medication use behavior (medication-related persistence and adherence rates) and costs associated with the introduction of latanoprost therapy in a treatment-naive older population (aged >or=65 years) enrolled in Medicare.
AB  - METHODS: The study employed a retrospective observational cohort design and used administrative claims data from a Medicare health maintenance organization (HMO), which offered complete coverage to enrollees, including prescription benefits. The case group consisted of patients with glaucoma who began latanoprost therapy. The control group consisted of enrollees with glaucoma who started any therapy other than latanoprost. Both groups were followed up for 1 year before and after initiation of therapy. Bivariate and multivariate techniques incorporating health care utilization in the year before the start of new therapy were used to determine the study outcomes.
AB  - RESULTS: The case group comprised 101 patients (mean age, 77.60 years), while the control group included 168 patients (mean age, 77.59 years). There were no significant differences across the 2 groups with respect to age, sex, general health scores on the 12 item Short-Form Health Survey, severity of comorbidity, or the proportion of respondents with perception of worsened health. Introduction of latanoprost therapy was associated with higher medication persistence (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.68-0.98) and adherence rates (mean [SD], 0.51 [0.26] vs 0.40 [0.25]; P < 0.001) compared with patients starting other glaucoma medication. Furthermore, there were no additional increases in total health care costs in the entire population associated with the introduction of latanoprost therapy, after adjusting for group and time effects, as well as other confounders (mean [SD], $4718.24 [$8982.92] vs $4046.55 [$6505.39]).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost therapy offered improved medication use behavior in these older adults enrolled in a Medicare HMO. There were no significant additional increases in overall health care costs as a result of introduction of latanoprost therapy, after adjusting for group and time effects, as well as other baseline confounders in this study cohort.

TI  - Socio-economic status and the therapeutic effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment--the design of the LEO study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The risk of arterial hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality increases with low socio-economic status (SES). Even small differences in blood pressure, whether untreated or despite treatment, account for this substantial difference. Most of the increased risk in the low socio-economic group is due to traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as overweight and obesity, alcohol consumption and a sedentary life style. Intense treatment of arterial hypertension has been shown to overcome these prognostic inequalities. Therefore, drugs with high efficacy, optimal treatment adherence and a low potential for drug-related side effects are needed in order to reduce the cardiovascular risk burden of patients with a low SES. The angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) olmesartan will be used to investigate the effectiveness of this drug in different socio-economic classes.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The LEO (Long-term Effectiveness of Olmesartan in different Socioeconomic groups) study is a large observational long-term study which has been set up to test the effectiveness of olmesartan within this context. The study has a matched-pairs design (1403 patients in both the low and the high socio-economic classes).
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The LEO study will test whether this regimen can reduce the SES-related difference in long-term blood pressure control and compliance in the low SES population.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The study may generate valuable information about the antihypertensive effectiveness of olmesartan alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in different socio-economic classes. It will further test whether the drug helps to reduce the inherent inequalities in cardiovascular prognosis between different socio-economic groups.
AB  - CURRENT STATUS: The study commenced in July 2007. Results are anticipated in December 2008.

TI  - The effects of mandatory prescribing of thiazides for newly treated, uncomplicated hypertension: interrupted time-series analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effects of a new reimbursement rule for antihypertensive medication that made thiazides mandatory first-line drugs for newly treated, uncomplicated hypertension. The objective of the new regulation was to reduce drug expenditures.
AB  - METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis on prescribing data before and after the new reimbursement rule for antihypertensive medication was put into effect. All patients started on antihypertensive medication in 61 general practices in Norway were included in the analysis. The new rule was put forward by the Ministry of Health and was approved by parliament. Adherence to the rule was monitored only minimally, and there were no penalties for non-adherence. Our primary outcome was the proportion of thiazide prescriptions among all prescriptions made for persons started on antihypertensive medication. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who, within 4 mo, reached recommended blood-pressure goals and the proportion of patients who, within 4 mo, were not started on a second antihypertensive drug. We also compared drug costs before and after the intervention. During the baseline period, 10% of patients started on antihypertensive medication were given a thiazide prescription. This proportion rose steadily during the transition period, after which it remained stable at 25%. For other outcomes, no statistically significant differences were demonstrated. Achievement of treatment goals was slightly higher (56.6% versus 58.4%) after the new rule was introduced, and the prescribing of a second drug was slightly lower (24.0% versus 21.8%). Drug costs were reduced by an estimated Norwegian kroner 4.8 million (0.58 million Euros, US$0.72 million) in the first year, which is equivalent to Norwegian kroner 1.06 per inhabitant (0.13 Euros, US$0.16).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing of thiazides in Norway for uncomplicated hypertension more than doubled after a reimbursement rule requiring the use of thiazides as the first-choice therapy was put into effect. However, the resulting savings on drug expenditures were modest. There were no significant changes in the achievement of treatment goals or in the prescribing of a second antihypertensive drug.

TI  - Dietary indiscretion and statin use.
AB  - To determine whether statin use leads to dietary indiscretion, this longitudinal cohort study examined the impact of statin initiation on saturated fat intake. We interviewed 71 patients who had received a new prescription for statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, first at the time of prescription and then again 3 and 6 months later. Patients were asked about their beliefs regarding diet and medications as well as their diet during the past 24 hours in all interviews and about their adherence to statins in the 3- and 6-month follow-up interviews. At the time of statin prescription, 54 participants (76 percent) wanted to reduce dietary fat, 50 (70 percent) believed statin use could cure their hyperlipidemia, and 31 (44 percent) thought that physicians prescribed statins to them despite their preference to continue to try dietary changes. After 6 months of statin use, no significant change in saturated fat intake was noted.

TI  - Corticosteroid-induced clinical adverse events: frequency, risk factors and patient's opinion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 50 years after the introduction of corticosteroids, few studies have focused on corticosteroid-induced adverse events after long-term systemic therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency, risk factors and patient's opinion regarding clinical adverse events occurring early during prednisone therapy.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a cohort study in two French centres. All consecutive patients starting long-term (> oir = 3 months), high dosage (> or = 20 mg day(-1)) prednisone therapy were enrolled. The main clinical adverse events attributable to corticosteroids were assessed after 3 months of therapy, by comparison with baseline status. The patient's opinion regarding the disability induced by these adverse events was recorded. Risk factors of frequently observed adverse effects were identified by using logistic regression.
AB  - RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were enrolled and 80 were monitored for at least 3 months (women 76%; mean age 59.1 +/- 18.7 years; giant cell arteritis 39%; mean baseline prednisone dosage 54 +/- 17 mg day(-1)). Lipodystrophy was the most frequent adverse event [63.0% (51.0-73.1)], was considered the most distressing by the patients and was most frequent in women and young patients. Neuropsychiatric disorders occurred in 42 patients [52.5% (41.0-63.8)], necessitating hospitalization in five cases. Skin disorders were noted by 37 patients [46.2% (35.0-57.7)] and were more frequent in women. Muscle cramp and proximal muscle weakness were reported by 32.5% (22.5-43.9) and 15% (8.0-24.7) of patients, respectively. Newly developed hypertension occurred in 8.7% (2.9-20.3) of patients. Lastly, 39% (19.7-61.4) of the premenopausal women reported menstrual disorders.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Lipodystrophy and neuropsychiatric disorders are common adverse events of long-term prednisone therapy and are particularly distressing for the patients concerned. The impact of these adverse events on adherence to corticosteroid therapy is not known.

TI  - Effects of benefit design change across 5 disease states.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of benefit design change (BDC) on medication adherence and persistence (including switch in therapy), drug costs, and total healthcare costs.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was performed using administrative claims data from an integrated healthcare system between January 2001 and December 2002.
AB  - METHODS: Continuously enrolled patients in 2001 and 2002 with allergic rhinitis, asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or osteoarthritis belonged to employer groups with or without a pharmacy BDC as of January 1, 2002. Prescription status (same, switch, or discontinue), adherence among patients receiving therapy, and differences in drug costs and total healthcare costs for each disease state were measured between groups. Bivariate and multivariate statistics were used to test differences in outcomes between groups.
AB  - RESULTS: Compared with the group without BDC, the proportion of patients who discontinued drug therapy was significantly greater in the BDC group among those with allergic rhinitis (67% vs 54%), asthma (66% vs 50%), osteoarthritis (61% vs 36%), and hypertension (39% vs 18%) (P < .05 for all). Medication compliance was not affected by BDC. The year-to-year pharmacy costs per patient in the BDC group decreased $305 for patients with osteoarthritis (P < .001) and $95 for patients with allergic rhinitis (P = .03). There was no significant effect on overall healthcare costs in any disease state during the year following the BDC.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A pharmacy BDC may result in decreased pharmacy costs, with no effect on overall healthcare costs within 1 year for patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, hypertension, or osteoarthritis.

TI  - Adherence patterns among patients treated with fixed-dose combination versus separate antihypertensive agents.
AB  - PURPOSE: Adherence patterns of patients treated with a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine-benazepril versus an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB) prescribed as separate drugs were studied.
AB  - METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of pharmacy claims from a managed care organization in the northeastern United States, patients who received at least two prescriptions for fixed-dose amlodipine-benazepril (n = 2839) or at least two prescriptions for an ACE inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine CCB (n = 3367) were followed over one year. Adherence, defined as the medication possession ratio (MPR), was calculated based on daily possession of the prescribed drug or drugs over the study period. To estimate the impact of overall drug burden on adherence to antihypertensive therapy, concomitant medication use was calculated as the number of American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS) drug classes prescribed.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence rates among patients receiving fixed-dose amlodipine-benazepril versus an ACE inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine CCB were 87.9% and 69.2%, respectively (p < 0.0001) over a mean follow-up of 259 and 247 days, respectively. Patients received a mean 4.0 major AHFS drug classes in the amlodipine-benazepril group and 5.2 in the ACE inhibitor plus dihydropyridine CCB group. As the number of concomitant drugs increased, the difference in the MPR between the two treatment groups increased in favor of fixed-dose amlodipine-benazepril.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Fixed-dose amlodipine-benazepril was associated with higher adherence rates versus an ACE inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine CCB taken as two separate tablets, regardless of the number of concomitant medications prescribed.

TI  - Effects of individual components of multiple behavior changes: the PREMIER trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess contributions of individual lifestyle changes on systolic blood pressure (SBP) changes.
AB  - METHODS: We examined associations between lifestyle behavior changes and SBP after 6 and 18 months in 782 PREMIER trial participants.
AB  - RESULTS: In multivariate models omitting weight, predicted SBP reductions ranged from (1)/2 to 1(1)/2 mm Hg for reduced urinary sodium, improved fitness, and adherence to the DASH diet (except sodium at 18 months). With weight included, only fitness change additionally predicted SBP at 18 months.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Several lifestyle behavior changes are important for BP lowering, but are difficult to detect when weight is included in multivariate models.

TI  - Hypertension Intervention Nurse Telemedicine Study (HINTS): testing a multifactorial tailored behavioral/educational and a medication management intervention for blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Only 31% of Americans with hypertension have their blood pressure (BP) under effective control. We describe a study that tests 3 different interventions in a randomized controlled trial using home BP telemedicine monitoring.
AB  - METHODS: A sample of hypertensive patients with poor BP control at baseline (N = 600) are randomized to 1 of 4 arms: (1) control group--a group of hypertensive patients who receive usual care; (2) nurse-administered tailored behavioral intervention; (3) nurse-administered medication management according to a hypertension decision support system; (4) combination of the 2 interventions. The interventions are triggered based on home BP values transmitted via telemonitoring devices over standard telephone lines. The tailored behavioral intervention involves promoting adherence with medication and health behaviors. Patients randomized to the medication management or the combined arm have their hypertension regimen changed by the study team using a validated hypertension decision support system based on evidence-based hypertension treatment guidelines and individualized to patients' comorbid illnesses. The primary outcome is BP control: < or = 140/90 mm Hg (nondiabetic) and < or = 130/80 mm Hg (diabetics) measured at 6-month intervals over 18 months (4 total measurements).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Given the increasing prevalence of hypertension and our inability to achieve adequate BP control using traditional models of care, testing novel interventions in patients' homes may improve access, quality, and outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indigenous Australians experience disproportionately high prevalence of, and morbidity and mortality from diabetes. There is an urgent need to understand how Indigenous primary care systems are organised to deliver diabetes services to those most in need, to monitor the quality of diabetes care received by Indigenous people, and to improve systems for better diabetes care.
AB  - METHODS: The intervention featured two annual cycles of assessment, feedback workshops, action planning, and implementation of system changes in 12 Indigenous community health centres. Assessment included a structured review of health service systems and audit of clinical records. Main process of care measures included adherence to guideline-scheduled services and medication adjustment. Main patient outcome measures were HbA1c, blood pressure and total cholesterol levels.
AB  - RESULTS: There was good engagement of health centre staff, with significant improvements in system development over the study period. Adherence to guideline-scheduled processes improved, including increases in 6 monthly testing of HbA1c from 41% to 74% (Risk ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.71-2.10), 3 monthly checking of blood pressure from 63% to 76% (1.27, 1.13-1.37), annual testing of total cholesterol from 56% to 74% (1.36, 1.20-1.49), biennial eye checking by a ophthalmologist from 34% to 54% (1.68, 1.39-1.95), and 3 monthly feet checking from 20% to 58% (3.01, 2.52-3.47). Medication adjustment rates following identification of elevated HbA1c and blood pressure were low, increasing from 10% to 24%, and from 13% to 21% respectively at year 1 audit. However, improvements in medication adjustment were not maintained at the year 2 follow-up. Mean HbA1c value improved from 9.3 to 8.9% (mean difference -0.4%, 95% CI -0.7;-0.1), but there was no improvement in blood pressure or cholesterol control.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This quality improvement (QI) intervention has proved to be highly acceptable in the Indigenous Australian primary care setting and has been associated with significant improvements in systems and processes of care and some intermediate outcomes. However, improvements appear to be limited by inadequate attention to abnormal clinical findings and medication management. Greater improvement in intermediate outcomes may be achieved by specifically addressing system barriers to therapy intensification through more effective engagement of medical staff in QI activities and/or greater use of nurse-practitioners.

TI  - The medication Adherence and Blood Pressure Control (ABC) trial: a multi-site randomized controlled trial in a hypertensive, multi-cultural, economically disadvantaged population.
AB  - The Medication Adherence and BP Control Trial (ABC Trial) is a randomized, controlled, multi-site, medication adherence and blood pressure (BP) control trial in an economically disadvantaged and multi-cultural population of hypertensive patients followed in primary care practices. To date, no other such trial has been published in which objective measures of adherence (electronic pill bottles) were used to assess the effectiveness of these behavioral interventions for hypertension. This study tested a combination of commercially-available interventions that can be easily accessed by health care providers and patients, and therefore may provide a real-world solution to the problem of non-adherence among hypertensives. The aim of the ABC Trial was to test the effectiveness of a stepped care intervention in improving both medication adherence to an antihypertensive medication regimen and BP control. Step 1 of the intervention employed home Self-BP Monitoring (SBPM); at this stage, there were two arms: (1) Usual Care (UC) and (2) Intervention. At Step 2, patients in the intervention arm whose BP had not come under control after 3 months were further randomized to one of two conditions: (1) continuation of SBPM (alone) or (2) continuation of SBPM plus telephone-based nurse case management (SBPM+NCM). Electronic Medication Event Monitoring (MEMS) was the primary measure of medication adherence, and in-office BP was the primary measure of hypertension control. We present an overview of the study design, details of the administrative structure of the study and a description of clinical site recruitment, patient recruitment, and follow-up assessments.

TI  - Clinical inertia: a common barrier to changing provider prescribing behavior.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional content analysis nested within a randomized, controlled trial was conducted to collect information on provider responses to computer alerts regarding guideline recommendations for patients with suboptimal hypertension care.
AB  - METHODS: Participants were providers who cared for 1,017 patients with uncontrolled hypertension on a single antihypertensive agent within Veterans Affairs primary care clinics. All reasons for action or inaction were sorted into a framework to explain the variation in guideline adaptation.
AB  - RESULTS: The 184 negative provider responses to computer alerts contained explanations for not changing patient treatment; 76 responses to the alerts were positive, that is, the provider was going to make a change in antihypertensive regimen. The negative responses were categorized as: inertia of practice (66%), lack of agreement with specific guidelines (5%), patient-based factors (17%), environmental factors (10%), and lack of knowledge (2%). Most of the 135 providers classified as inertia of practice indicated, "Continue current medications and I will discuss at the next visit." The median number of days until the next visit was 45 days (interquartile range, 29 to 78 days).
AB  - DISCUSSION: Clinical inertia was the primary reason for failing to engage in otherwise indicated treatment change in a subgroup of patients. A framework was provided as a taxonomy for classification of provider barriers.

TI  - [Problems of a physician-patient interaction and control of arterial hypertension in Russia. Main results of scientific-practical program ARGUS-2]. [Russian]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the problems of physician-patient cooperation, patient- and physician related barrieres to target blood pressure (BP) achievement and to demonstrate improvement of BP control with indapamide SR 1.5 mg, when given to patients remaining uncontrolled while receiving antihypertensive therapy without thiazide diuretics (TD).
AB  - METHODS: The trial Improvement of Arterial Hypertension Control in High-Risk Hypertensive Patients (ARGUS-2) run in 15 Russian centres during the year 2006. Retrospective analysis of medical notes of 684 outpatients and 575 inpatients with arterial hypertension. Validated questionnaires were used for interview of 373 physicians and 1298 patients. The study of Arifon retard efficacy was carried out in 1438 outpatients with difficult-to-control hypertension.
AB  - RESULTS: BP was above the goal level in 97.1% pts at the first analyzed visit to an outpatient department. Antihypertensive therapy was unchanged in 20.5% cases, the drug dose was increased in 46,6%, additional medication was administered in 36,8%. In 30.8% pts antihypertensive agent was substituted by another class drug. At the last analyzed visit target BP was found in 24.4% pts. BP control was poorer in pts with BP goal <130/80 mmHg (20.1%) than in those with higher target BP (25.9%). Achievement of BP goal was associated with combination therapy, higher rate of TD administration and with more frequent visits to physician. During hospitalization target BP <140/<90 mmHg was achieved in 87.1%,<130/<80 mmHg in. 76.2%. Arifon retard administration resulted in target BO achievement in 84.5% patients. Physicians percept low adherence to antihypertensive treatment, lack of patients knowledge about risk related to arterial hypertension, economical problems as main barriers to improvement of arterial hypertension management. Patients considered economical problems related to antihypertensive treatment more much less important than physicians did.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The study results suggest the importance of therapeutic inertia overcome to improve arterial hypertension management in Russia. Low rate of multiple combination therapy and TD prescription are important features of therapeutic inertia. Polar perception of problems related to arterial hypertension by physicians and patients should be considered as influencing factors for educational programs development.

TI  - Does participatory decision making improve hypertension self-care behaviors and outcomes?.
AB  - This study examined patients' perceptions of their providers' participatory decision making (PDM) style and hypertension self-care behaviors and outcomes. Five hundred fifty-four veterans with hypertension enrolled in the Veterans' Study to Improve the Control of Hypertension rated providers' PDM styles using a validated 3-item instrument. Behaviors assessed included presence of a home blood pressure monitor, monitoring frequency, and self-reported antihypertensive medication adherence. Overall, veterans with hypertension rated providers as highly participatory. In adjusted analyses, a lower PDM score was associated with decreased odds of having a home monitor (odds ratio, 0.90 per 10-point decrement in PDM score; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.98) but not with monitoring frequency, adherence, or blood pressure control. Providers' involvement of patients in decision making, reflected in ratings of PDM style, may be important to securing patients' participation in their own care, but alone this factor seems insufficient. No relationship between PDM score and blood pressure control was observed.

TI  - Treatment adherence among primary care patients in a historically disadvantaged community in South Africa: a qualitative study.
AB  - The present study examined the issue of treatment adherence among a sample of 23 rural South African patients living with either hypertension or diabetes, or both. The sample was asked to participate in qualitative interviews that asked about various aspects of their experience of their illness and treatment. The analysis of the data focused on the content of participants' concerns and difficulties with adhering to treatment recommendations. The themes that emerged from the study were participants' attribution of the origin of their illness, their subjective experience of their illness, their concerns about the consequences of poor adherence, financial problems and psychosocial support.

TI  - Combined diet and exercise intervention in the workplace: effect on cardiovascular disease risk factors.
AB  - This study assessed the effectiveness of a 12-week pilot employee wellness program in reducing risk factors for coronary heart disease. Fifty university employees with at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor participated in the program. Interventions focused on diet, exercise, and monthly workshops. Pre- and post-intervention measurements included weight, body composition, blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, and blood sugar. Twenty-five employees had post-intervention measurements. A survey was administered to assess adherence. The correlation between adherence and improvement in cardiovascular disease risk factors was also tested. Significant differences were observed between pre- and post-intervention measurements of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, and weight. A significant correlation existed between self-reported level of participation in the diet aspect of the program and improvement in LDL levels. This multi-component, 12-week pilot employee wellness program was effective in reducing cardiovascular disease risk.

TI  - [No response to antihypertensive therapy: consider non-adherence]. [Dutch]
AB  - In 3 patients, 2 men aged 62 and 43 years, respectively, and 1 woman aged 53 years, the medication prescribed to reduce blood pressure was insufficiently effective. Drug adherence was questioned. The first patient was afraid of the side effects mentioned in the medication information leaflet. The second patient had insufficient plasma levels of the medication but would not discuss the subject. The blood pressure of the third patient was uncontrolled despite treatment with three antihypertensive drugs. During a short hospital stay, her blood pressure responded favourably to treatment with only one of the three drugs. Subsequent repeated instruction did not improve her situation. Drug adherence is an important issue in daily clinical practice. In patients with asymptomatic conditions like hypertension, adherence is expected to be poor and worsen over time. Adherence is very difficult to measure. Risk factors for poor adherence include complex medication schedules, multiple dosing times, depression and real or suspected side effects. Measures to improve drug adherence include simplifying the medication schedule, discussing the schedule during check-ups, using automated blood pressure measuring devices at home, maintaining e-mail contact with the patient and involving a specialised nurse. Increased awareness of poor adherence is an important step toward improving hypertension treatment.

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of poor antihypertensive medication adherence in an urban health clinic setting.
AB  - Poor medication adherence may contribute to low hypertension control rates. In 2005, 295 hypertensive patients who reported taking antihypertensive medication were administered a telephone questionnaire including an 8-item scale assessing medication adherence. Overall, 35.6%, 36.0%, and 28.4% of patients were determined to have good, medium, and poor medication adherence, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, adults younger than 50 years and 51 to 60 years were 1.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-3.42) and 1.53 (95% CI, 0.64-3.66), respectively, times more likely to be less adherent when compared with their counterparts who were older than 60 years. Black adults and men were 4.30 (95% CI, 1.06-17.5) and 2.45 (95% CI, 1.04-5.78) times more likely to be less adherent, respectively. Additionally, caring for dependents, an initial diagnosis of hypertension within 10 years, being uncomfortable about asking the doctor questions, and wanting to spend more time with the doctor if possible were associated with poor medication adherence. The current study identified a set of risk factors for poor antihypertensive medication adherence in the urban setting.

TI  - Cost effectiveness of an adherence-improving programme in hypertensive patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to antihypertensive drugs is high, and the economic consequences of non-adherence may be substantial. The Medication Events Monitoring System (MEMS), which is a method to improve adherence, has been shown to be a useful tool for the management of adherence problems.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of the MEMS compared with usual care in a population of hypertensive patients with poor adherence. The MEMS programme consisted of provision of containers fitted with electronic caps together with adherence training if indicated.
AB  - METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, 164 hypertensive patients in the experimental strategy and 89 patients in the usual care strategy were followed for 5 months. Patients who had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) > or = 95 mm Hg despite the use of antihypertensive drugs were eligible. Patients were recruited by a GP, and treatment took place in general practice. In the experimental strategy, electronic monitoring of the intake of antihypertensive drugs was introduced without change of medication. Unsatisfactory adherence was defined as < 85% of days with the number of doses taken as prescribed. In the usual care strategy, antihypertensive treatment was intensified by the addition or change of antihypertensive drugs, if necessary, without provision of an electronic monitor. Outcome parameters included the proportion of patients with normalised blood pressure (NBP) at 5 months and QALYs. Costs were quantified from the healthcare and societal perspective. Non-parametric bootstrap simulations were performed to quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were presented. In addition, a number of univariate sensitivity analyses were performed on deterministic variables.
AB  - RESULTS: At 5 months, 3.1% (95% UI [uncertainty interval] -9.7%, +15.8%) more patients had NBP, and 0.003 (95% UI -0.005, +0.010) more QALYs were generated in the experimental strategy. A statistically significant lower percentage of patients had a dose escalation in the experimental strategy. Irrespective of the ceiling ratio for cost effectiveness, the cost-effectiveness probability was between 75% and 80% for the analysis from the healthcare perspective using proportion of patients with NBP as the outcome parameter. For the analysis from the societal perspective using QALYs as the outcome parameter, this probability was between 45% and 51%.
AB  - CONCLUSION: For a time horizon of 5 months, a difference in both cost and effect could not be detected between an adherence-improving programme compared with usual care for hypertensive patients. The probability that the adherence-improving programme is cost effective is at best moderate. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness result is surrounded with considerable uncertainty and large-scale implementation warrants additional research into the economic consequences of this intervention. Patients may benefit from the use of a MEMS monitor in situations where BP targets are not reached because of suspected non-adherence and both patient and GP are reluctant to increase the dose or number of antihypertensive drugs.

TI  - Blood pressure responses to lifestyle physical activity among young, hypertension-prone African-American women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity and obesity increase the risk for hypertension, and both are more prevalent in African-American than Caucasian women. Regular physical activity serves as an important intervention for reducing cardiovascular risk, yet the ideal physical activity profile to meet the needs of young, sedentary African-American women remains unclear. We performed a randomized, parallel, single-blind study to examine the effect of lifestyle physical activity (LPA) on blood pressure indices in sedentary African-American women aged 18 to 45 years with prehypertension or untreated stage 1 hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: The primary intervention was an 8-week individualized, home-based program in which women randomized to Exercise (n = 14) were instructed to engage in lifestyle-compatible physical activity (eg, walking, stair climbing) for 10 minutes, 3 times a day, 5 days a week, at a prescribed heart rate corresponding to an intensity of 50% to 60% heart rate reserve. Women in the No Exercise group (n = 10) continued with their usual daily activities. Mean changes in cuff, ambulatory, and pressure load indices were compared using paired t tests, and physical activity adherence was expressed as percentages.
AB  - RESULTS: Women in the Exercise group had a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (-6.4 mm Hg, P = .036), a decrease in diastolic blood pressure status to the prehypertensive level (90.8 vs 87.4 mm Hg), and greater reductions in nighttime pressure load compared with the No Exercise group. Adherence to LPA was exceedingly high by all measures (65%-98%) and correlated with change in systolic blood pressure (r = -0.620, P = .024).
AB  - CONCLUSION: The accumulation of LPA reduced cuff, ambulatory, and pressure load. The accumulation of LPA appears well tolerated and feasible in this sample of young African-American women, demonstrated by the overall high adherence rates. Given the excess burden of pressure-related clinical sequelae among African Americans and the strong correlation between pressure load and target organ damage, LPA may represent a practical and effective strategy in this population.

TI  - Electronic monitoring of adherence as a tool to improve blood pressure control. A randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to antihypertensive drug regimens is believed to be a major contributor to treatment failure. Electronic monitoring of adherence may improve adherence and allow differentiation between those who are nonadherent and those who are pharmacologically nonresponsive. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of electronic monitoring of adherence in lowering blood pressure (BP) in comparison with usual care.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 258 patients with high BP despite use of antihypertensive medication were randomly assigned to either continuation of usual care (with adjustment in antihypertensive medication if necessary) or to the introduction of electronic monitoring. Adherence to antihypertensive medication was monitored for 2 months without medication changes. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who reached target BP levels after a 5-month follow-up period.
AB  - RESULTS: At 5 months, 50.6% of the patients in the usual care group reached adequate BP, v 53.7% in the electronic monitoring group (P = .73). The percentages of patients with drug additions or increases in dosage were higher in the usual care group compared with those in whom adherence was monitored (P < .01).
AB  - CONCLUSION: These data show that electronic monitoring in comparison to usual care results in similar BP control but leads to fewer drug changes and less drug use. This result is likely to be achieved by improving adherence. Hence a strategy that includes electronic monitoring has the potential to prevent unnecessary treatment escalation in patients with poor adherence.

TI  - An RCT of the effect of motivational interviewing on medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans: rationale and design.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension disproportionately affects African Americans compared to whites, and it is the single most common explanation for the disparity in mortality between African Americans and whites. Adherence with antihypertensive medications can help reduce risk of negative hypertension-related outcomes. Motivational interviewing is a promising patient-centered approach for improving adherence in patients with chronic diseases. In this paper we describe the rationale and design of an ongoing randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of motivational interviewing versus usual care in improving medication adherence among 190 African American uncontrolled hypertensive patients, who receive care in a primary care setting.
AB  - METHODS: The usual care group receives standard medical care, while those in the intervention group receive standard care plus four sessions of motivational interviewing at 3-month intervals for a period of 1 year. This technique consists of brief, patient-driven counseling sessions to facilitate initiation and maintenance of behavior change. The primary outcome is adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medication, assessed with the electronic medication events monitoring system (MEMS) and the Morisky self-report adherence questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are within-patient changes in blood pressure, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation between baseline and 12 months. We report the baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Despite the potential utility of motivational interviewing, little is known about its effectiveness in improving medication adherence among hypertensive patients, especially African Americans. In addition to the baseline data this study has generated, this trial should provide data with which we can assess the effectiveness of this approach as a behavioral intervention.

TI  - The Take Control of Your Blood pressure (TCYB) study: study design and methodology.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the 65 million Americans with hypertension, only approximately 31% have their blood pressure under control (<140/90 mm/Hg). Despite the damaging impact of hypertension and the availability of evidence-based target values for blood pressure, interventions to improve blood pressure control have had limited success.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A randomized controlled health services intervention trial with a two by two design is being conducted to improve blood pressure control. This five-year trial evaluates two patient-directed interventions designed to improve blood pressure control among patients diagnosed with hypertension in a community-based primary care setting.
AB  - METHODS: Patients are randomized to one of four groups: usual care, home blood pressure monitoring, tailored behavioral self-management intervention that is administered via telephone by a nurse, or a combination of the home blood pressure monitoring and tailored behavioral intervention. Patients receiving the home blood pressure monitoring are trained in the use of an electronic blood pressure measurement device, are asked to measure their blood pressure 3 times/week, and send in two-month blood pressure recordings throughout the 24-month study duration. The behavioral intervention incorporates patients' need assessments and involves tailored behavioral and education modules to promote medication adherence and improve specific health behaviors. A nurse delivers all behavioral self-management modules over the telephone bi-monthly for 24 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who achieve control of their blood pressure based on evidence-based guidelines (for patients without diabetes <140/90 mm/Hg, for patients with diabetes <130/80 mm/Hg) evaluated at six-month intervals over 24 months (five measurements) using a random-zero sphygmomanometer.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite the known risk of poor blood pressure control, and the wide availability of effective treatment strategies, a majority of adults still do not have their blood pressure controlled. This study will be an important step in defining two explicit interventions to improve blood pressure control. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine both a tailored behavioral self-management intervention and self-monitoring home blood pressure intervention to improve blood pressure control among patients in a primary care setting.

TI  - Identifying barriers to hypertension guideline adherence using clinician feedback at the point of care.
AB  - Factors contributing to low adherence to clinical guidelines by clinicians are not well understood. The user interface of ATHENA-HTN, a guideline-based decision support system (DSS) for hypertension, presents a novel opportunity to collect clinician feedback on recommendations displayed at the point of care. We analyzed feedback from 46 clinicians who received ATHENA advisories as part of a 15-month randomized trial to identify potential reasons clinicians may not intensify hypertension therapy when it is recommended. Among the 368 visits for which feedback was provided, clinicians commonly reported they did not follow recommendations because: recorded blood pressure was not representative of the patient's typical blood pressure; hypertension was not a clinical priority for the visit; or patients were nonadherent to medications. For many visits, current quality-assurance algorithms may incorrectly identify clinically appropriate decisions as guideline nonadherent due to incomplete capture of relevant information. We present recommendations for how automated DSSs may help identify "apparent" barriers and better target decision support.

TI  - [Compliance with the 2002 consensus document of the Spanish Society of Nephrology for the control of diabetic nephropathy in Catalonia (ECCODIAB)]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the level of compliance with the 2002 consensus document (Spanish Society of Nephrology) on guidelines for the detection, prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy in Catalonia.
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Multicenter (23 hospitals), observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study conducted in 413 diabetic patients (61.7% men, 38.3% women) with a median age of 66.2 +/-11.5 years (26-93 years). The ANOVA test (post-hoc analysis; p value< 0.05) was used to study the relationships between the stages of diabetic nephropathyand different variables.
AB  - RESULTS: 90.3% of the patients had type 2 DM. The following anthropometric parameters were observed: BMI 29.8 +/- 5 kg/m2 (BMI > 30 kg/m2: 48.7%) and waist circumference 104.1 +/- 14 cm (48.6% men > 102 cm and 78.9% women > 88 cm). Serum creatinine 1.9 +/- 1.3 mg/dl and simplified MDRD equation 45.3 +/- 25.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 [65.8%with CKD stages 3 and 4]. 80% of patients had ophthalmologic examination and 52.8% antiplatelet treatment. Hb A1c was 7.3 +/- 1.3%, but the percentage of patients with glycated hemoglobin > 7% and 8% was 54.9 and 28.6% [only 50.2% had been seen by an endocrinologist in the last 6 months]. 52.8% of patients were treated with insulin and 44.1% with anti-diabetic drugs, although only 19.6% used the new anti-diabetic drugs. 61% of patients had an LDLc > 100 mg/dl (61% treated) and 44% had triglycerides (TG) > 150 mg/dl (72% treated). 95% of patients presented with hypertension (BP > or = 130/80 mmHg),91% were undergoing antihypertensive treatment (79.7% with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and / or angiotensin receptor blockers). 81% with microalbuminuria and 78%with established proteinuria were receiving anti-proteinuric treatment. Of the patients considered to be refractory to BP (>3 drugs), only 28.9% underwent ambulatory BP monitoring. Significant differences were observed between stages of diabetic nephropathy and glycated hemoglobin (HBA1c; p = 0.048), systolic blood pressure (SBP; p = 0.024), lipidic control (HDLc; p = 0.015 and TG; p = 0.034), anemia (Hb; p = 0.010) and CKD (creatinine and sMDRD; p = 0.000). The levels of compliance with the therapeutic objectives regarding lipid control (LDL < or = 100 mg/dl and TG< or = 150 mg/dl), BP < or = 130/80 mmHg and HbA1c < or =7% were 1 objective: 68%, 2 objectives: 21.8% and 3 objectives: only 4% of patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of our study, only a reduced proportion of patients fulfilled the different therapeutic end-points indicated. Future measures will be directed at improving physician-patient relationships with the main aim of intensifying the therapeutic measures to attain better metabolic and blood pressure control, nephroprotection and prevention in the appearance of cardiovascular events.

TI  - Relationship between the frequency of blood pressure self-measurement and blood pressure reduction with antihypertensive therapy : results of the OLMETEL (OLMEsartan TELemonitoring blood pressure) study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This subanalysis of the OLMETEL (OLMEsartan TELemonitoring blood pressure) study in patients with essential hypertension assessed the relationship between the frequency of blood pressure self-measurement (BPSM) and the response to blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapy with olmesartan medoxomil, and the number of BP readings per week necessary to detect a mean systolic or diastolic BP reduction > or =5mm Hg.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 53 patients with essential hypertension received treatment with olmesartan medoxomil 10, 20 or 40 mg daily for 12 weeks. BPSM was performed for the first 9 weeks using a TensioPhone TP2 device. Patients were instructed to measure BP at least twice daily (morning and evening).
AB  - RESULTS: After the first 9 weeks of the 12-week treatment period, the extent of BP reduction correlated with the number of BPSMs. Systolic/diastolic BP reductions in patients with a 100% adherence to at least two BP measurements daily were -16.6/-8.0mm Hg compared with -0.2/-3.3mm Hg in patients with only a 75% adherence to at least one BP measurement daily. Obtaining five home BP readings per week resulted in a sensitivity of 94.8% and a specificity of 90.0% to detect a BP reduction of > or =5mm Hg.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients adhering to the instructions for BPSM (at least two measurements daily) had a better response to antihypertensive treatment with olmesartan medoxomil. Whether BPSM per se resulted in an improved adherence to therapy or whether the number of recordings was an indicator of already existing adherence remains to be determined. Obtaining at least five home BP readings per week was identified as the threshold for correctly predicting response to olmesartan medoxomil treatment.

TI  - Effect of a pharmacy care program on medication adherence and persistence, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: Poor medication adherence diminishes the health benefits of pharmacotherapies. Elderly patients with coronary risk factors frequently require treatment with multiple medications, placing them at increased risk for nonadherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a comprehensive pharmacy care program to improve medication adherence and its associated effects on blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A multiphase, prospective study with an observational phase and a randomized controlled trial conducted at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center of 200 community-based patients aged 65 years or older taking at least 4 chronic medications. The study was conducted from June 2004 to August 2006.
AB  - INTERVENTION: After a 2-month run-in phase (measurement of baseline adherence, BP, and LDL-C), patients entered a 6-month intervention phase (standardized medication education, regular follow-up by pharmacists, and medications dispensed in time-specific packs). Following the intervention phase, patients were randomized to continued pharmacy care vs usual care for an additional 6 months.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point of the observation phase was change in the proportion of pills taken vs baseline; secondary end points were the associated changes in BP and LDL-C. Primary end point of the randomization phase was the between-group comparison of medication persistence.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 200 elderly patients (77.1% men; mean [SD] age, 78 [8.3] years), taking a mean (SD) of 9 (3) chronic medications were enrolled. Coronary risk factors included drug-treated hypertension in 184 patients (91.5%) and drug-treated hyperlipidemia in 162 (80.6%). Mean (SD) baseline medication adherence was 61.2% (13.5%). After 6 months of intervention, medication adherence increased to 96.9% (5.2%; P<.001) and was associated with significant improvements in systolic BP (133.2 [14.9] to 129.9 [16.0] mm Hg; P = .02) and LDL-C (91.7 [26.1] to 86.8 [23.4] mg/dL; P = .001). Six months after randomization, the persistence of medication adherence decreased to 69.1% (16.4%) among those patients assigned to usual care, whereas it was sustained at 95.5% (7.7%) in pharmacy care (P<.001). This was associated with significant reductions in systolic BP in the pharmacy care group (-6.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -10.7 to -3.1 mm Hg) vs the usual care group (-1.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.9 to 3.9 mm Hg; P = .04), but no significant between-group differences in LDL-C levels or reductions.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacy care program led to increases in medication adherence, medication persistence, and clinically meaningful reductions in BP, whereas discontinuation of the program was associated with decreased medication adherence and persistence.

TI  - Self-reported adherence with medication and cardiovascular disease outcomes in the Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study (ANBP2).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether responses to a previously validated four-item medication adherence questionnaire were associated with adverse cardiovascular events.
AB  - DESIGN: Survey conducted among a cohort of participants in the Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study.
AB  - SETTING: Australian general practice.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 4039 older people with hypertension.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All major cardiovascular events or death; first specific cardiovascular event.
AB  - RESULTS: Subjects who adhered to their medication regimen (compared with non-adherent subjects) were significantly less likely to experience a first cardiovascular event or a first non-fatal cardiovascular event (hazard ratio [HR] for both, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.98; P = 0.03); a fatal other cardiovascular event (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.99; P = 0.04); or a first occurrence of heart failure (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.90; P = 0.02). Those who answered yes to "Did you ever forget to take your medication?" were significantly more likely to experience a cardiovascular event or death (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04-1.57; P = 0.02); a first cardiovascular event or death (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.60; P = 0.01); a first cardiovascular event (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09-1.65; P = 0.01); or a first non-fatal cardiovascular event (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.09-1.66; P = 0.01). Those who answered yes to "Sometimes, if you felt worse when you took your medicine, did you stop taking it?" were significantly more likely to experience a first occurrence of heart failure (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.16-3.64; P = 0.01).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who adhered to their medication regimen were less likely to experience major cardiovascular events or death. The question relating to forgetting to take medication identified non-adherent subjects likely to experience a cardiovascular event or death. Clinicians could use this question to identify patients with hypertension who are likely to benefit from medication adherence strategies.

TI  - Impact on hypertension control of a patient-held guideline: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is generally poorly controlled in primary care. One possible intervention for improving control is the harnessing of patient expertise through education and encouragement to challenge their care.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether encouraging patients to manage their hypertension in an 'expert' manner, by providing them with information in a clear clinical guideline, coupled with an explicit exhortation to become involved in and to challenge their own care if appropriate, would improve their care.
AB  - DESIGN OF STUDY: Single blind randomised controlled trial of detailed guideline versus standard information.
AB  - SETTING: Single urban general practice over 1 year.
AB  - METHOD: Patient-held guideline with written explicit exhortation to challenge care when appropriate. Two hundred and ninety-four of 536 eligible patients on the practice hypertension register were recruited, all of whom were randomised into one of two groups. Two hundred and thirty-six patients completed the study.
AB  - RESULTS:
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOME: average systolic blood pressure.
AB  - SECONDARY OUTCOMES: proportion of patients with blood pressure < 150 mmHg systolic and < 90 mmHg diastolic, average cholesterol, proportion of patients prescribed statins and aspirin according to guideline, hospital anxiety and depression score. No clinically, or statistically significant differences were found between intervention and control with respect to all parameters or in anxiety and depression levels. Statin and aspirin use improved throughout the course of the study in both groups. Statin use showed a trend (P = 0.02) in favour of control.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In this study there was no clinically significant perceived benefit to patients as a result of providing them with a hypertension guideline. Patient guidelines are currently planned for many chronic illnesses. It is important to determine the utility of such interventions before scarce resources are applied to them.

TI  - An educational programme for peer review groups to improve treatment of chronic heart failure and diabetes mellitus type 2 in general practice.
AB  - RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Peer review groups are considered helpful for quality improvement in primary care. An interactive educational programme for small peer groups was developed, focusing on the implementation of newly developed treatment guidelines. The aim is to evaluate the effect of the programme on adherence to treatment guidelines in general practice.
AB  - METHODS: A cluster randomized trial using a balanced incomplete block design was used; one arm received a programme on treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF), the other on hypertension treatment in diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM). A random sample of 10 CHF and 10 T2DM patients per GP was drawn, for whom data were extracted from electronic patient records 1 years before and 6 months after the intervention. The outcomes were prescribing of ACE inhibitors, and antihypertensive treatment in T2DM. The effect was analysed separately for both programmes using multilevel regression models.
AB  - RESULTS: All 27 peer review groups in one region in the Netherlands were randomized, of which 16 participated. No significant effects were observed in the CHF group or in the T2DM group. The opportunity for change was limited, as only 53% of the CHF patients and 60% of the T2DM patients had a contact with their GP between the intervention and follow-up measurement.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The peer review programme was not successful for changing the treatment of chronic patients, although the programme focused on dealing with barriers perceived by the participants. Not all problems perceived can be solved in a peer group discussion.

TI  - Rational prescribing in primary care (RaPP): a cluster randomized trial of a tailored intervention.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A gap exists between evidence and practice regarding the management of cardiovascular risk factors. This gap could be narrowed if systematically developed clinical practice guidelines were effectively implemented in clinical practice. We evaluated the effects of a tailored intervention to support the implementation of systematically developed guidelines for the use of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
AB  - METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster-randomized trial comparing a tailored intervention to passive dissemination of guidelines in 146 general practices in two geographical areas in Norway. Each practice was randomized to either the tailored intervention (70 practices; 257 physicians) or control group (69 practices; 244 physicians). Patients started on medication for hypertension or hypercholesterolemia during the study period and all patients already on treatment that consulted their physician during the trial were included. A multifaceted intervention was tailored to address identified barriers to change. Key components were an educational outreach visit with audit and feedback, and computerized reminders linked to the medical record system. Pharmacists conducted the visits. Outcomes were measured for all eligible patients seen in the participating practices during 1 y before and after the intervention. The main outcomes were the proportions of (1) first-time prescriptions for hypertension where thiazides were prescribed, (2) patients assessed for cardiovascular risk before prescribing antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering drugs, and (3) patients treated for hypertension or hypercholesterolemia for 3 mo or more who had achieved recommended treatment goals. The intervention led to an increase in adherence to guideline recommendations on choice of antihypertensive drug. Thiazides were prescribed to 17% of patients in the intervention group versus 11% in the control group (relative risk 1.94; 95% confidence interval 1.49-2.49, adjusted for baseline differences and clustering effect). Little or no differences were found for risk assessment prior to prescribing and for achievement of treatment goals.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our tailored intervention had a significant impact on prescribing of antihypertensive drugs, but was ineffective in improving the quality of other aspects of managing hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in primary care.

TI  - [Shared decision-making with hypertensive patients. Results of an implementation in Germany]. [German]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lack of compliance is a common problem in the treatment of hypertension. Ineffective physician-patient-communication and a lack of patients involvement can play a crucial role. We tested the hypothesis that shared decision-making (SDM) results in higher involvement of patients in their blood pressure lowering therapy and evaluated the effects of SDM on the control of blood pressure.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups of 84 hypertensives were compared: an intervention group (26 women and 13 men, age 61 +/- 10 years) treated by 15 specially SDM-trained primary care physicians, and a control group of 45 hypertensives. All 84 patients were enrolled in a patient education programme. Changes of blood pressure were assessed after one year by self-measurements. Questionnaires about their attitude to patient autonomy, the SDM process, quality of life, physician-patient-relationship and life-style changes were analysed as well.
AB  - RESULTS: After one year the blood pressure had decreased in both the intervention group (-9.26 +/- 10.2/-5.3 +/- 9.5 mmHg, p < 0.001) and in the control group (-6.0 +/- 11.8/-3.0 +/- 8.3 mmHg, p < 0.05), without a significant difference between the two groups. Among a subgroup of patients with a marked preference for SDM there was a close correlation between an increase of SDM and a decrease in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.016). Also, the numbers of antihypertensive drugs increased more in the intervention group (p = 0.022) than in control patients. Furthermore, increase in knowledge about hypertension and its treatment was greater in the intervention group (P=0.006).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Implementation of SDM had a significant effect on systolic blood pressure control only in the subgroup of patients with marked preference for SDM. Thus, the identification of patients with a preference for SDM may improve blood pressure control and their adherence to the prescribed drug therapy.

TI  - Impact of baseline echocardiography on treatment outcome in primary care patients with newly detected arterial hypertension: a randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to test whether baseline echocardiography in newly detected hypertension improves left ventricular mass index and blood pressure control. This is a randomized trial with primary care patients.
AB  - METHODS: After routine clinical work-up 177 consecutive patients with newly detected hypertension were randomized according to result of their echocardiogram (echo group and control group). Treating physicians were encouraged to prescribe angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy for patients with evidence of hypertensive target organ damage. Mean blood pressure (BP) and echocardiographic left ventricular mass index were measured at baseline and after 6 months of therapy in both groups.
AB  - RESULTS: More patients with hypertensive target organ damage were identified in the echo group as compared to the control group (58 of 91 [64%] v 42 of 86 [49%] patients (difference 15%, 95% CI 1%-29%). In the echo group, 41 patients (45%) received angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy as compared to 27 patients (31%) in the control group (difference 14%, 95% CI 0-28%). After 6 months, there were no differences in mean left ventricular mass index, mean diastolic 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, or mean systolic and diastolic office BP between the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In patients with newly detected hypertension, baseline echocardiography detects more patients with hypertensive target organ damage, but does not lead to a reduction in left ventricular mass index or improved BP control after 6 months of therapy.

TI  - Initial steps taken by nine primary care practices to implement alcohol screening guidelines with hypertensive patients: the AA-TRIP project.
AB  - Many medical conditions are caused or exacerbated by heavy drinking, necessitating alcohol screening and discussion in primary care practices. This is particularly true of hypertension, the most common primary diagnosis in the United States, which has been linked to the regular consumption of 3 or more standard alcoholic beverages a day. The Accelerating Alcohol Screening-Translating Research into Practice (AA-TRIP) project was designed to improve detection and management of alcohol problems in primary care patients with hypertension. Medical providers are being trained using the Practice Partner Research Network's- Translating Research into Practice (PPRNet-TRIP) quality improvement model. This includes a multi-method intervention (electronic medical records, on-site academic detailing, practice feedback reports and annual network meetings) to help practices increase adherence to clinical guidelines. Qualitative analyses of initial steps taken by nine primary care practices toward the routine implementation of alcohol screening guidelines are presented. Organizational factors and provider and patient characteristics all influenced the method and consistency of alcohol screening and intervention. Perceived time constraints, patient sensitivity to questions about alcohol, and possible stigma associated with a diagnosis of alcoholism were also relevant barriers requiring problem solving.

TI  - Stop Hypertension with the Acupuncture Research Program (SHARP): results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  - Case studies and small trials suggest that acupuncture may effectively treat hypertension, but no large randomized trials have been reported. The Stop Hypertension with the Acupuncture Research Program pilot trial enrolled 192 participants with untreated blood pressure (BP) in the range of 140/90 to 179/109 mm Hg. The design of the trial combined rigorous methodology and adherence to principles of traditional Chinese medicine. Participants were weaned off antihypertensives before enrollment and were then randomly assigned to 3 treatments: individualized traditional Chinese acupuncture, standardized acupuncture at preselected points, or invasive sham acupuncture. Participants received < or = 12 acupuncture treatments over 6 to 8 weeks. During the first 10 weeks after random assignment, BP was monitored every 14 days, and antihypertensives were prescribed if BP exceeded 180/110 mm Hg. The mean BP decrease from baseline to 10 weeks, the primary end point, did not differ significantly between participants randomly assigned to active (individualized and standardized) versus sham acupuncture (systolic BP: -3.56 versus -3.84 mm Hg, respectively; 95% CI for the difference: -4.0 to 4.6 mm Hg; P=0.90; diastolic BP: -4.32 versus -2.81 mm Hg, 95% CI for the difference: -3.6 to 0.6 mm Hg; P=0.16). Categorizing participants by age, race, gender, baseline BP, history of antihypertensive use, obesity, or primary traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis did not reveal any subgroups for which the benefits of active acupuncture differed significantly from sham acupuncture. Active acupuncture provided no greater benefit than invasive sham acupuncture in reducing systolic or diastolic BP.

TI  - Efficacy of a transtheoretical model-based expert system for antihypertensive adherence.
AB  - Blood pressure is not controlled in as many as 50%-75% of hypertensive patients, primarily because of inadequate adherence to treatment. This paper examines the efficacy of a Transtheoretical Model (TTM)-based expert system intervention designed to improve adherence with antihypertensives in a sample of 1,227 adults. Participants were proactively recruited and randomly assigned to receive usual care or three individualized expert system reports and a stage-matched manual over 6 months. Participants were surveyed at baseline, and 6, 12, and 18 months. Significantly more of the intervention group participants reported being in Action and Maintenance at follow-up time points (ie, 73.1% of the treatment group versus 57.6% of the control group at 12 months and 69.1% of the treatment group versus 59.2% of the control group at 18 months). Scores on a behavioral measure of nonadherence differed significantly at follow-up time points. TTM-based expert system interventions have the potential for a significant impact on entire populations of individuals who fail to adhere, regardless of their readiness to change.

TI  - [Effectiveness of a quality improvement intervention in blood pressure control in Primary Care]. [Spanish]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of a quality improvement intervention on professionals sanitary in blood pressure control in hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: Quality improvement trials with cuasi-experimental design. Two primary care health centres. One centre was assigned intervention group (7 family doctors and 419 patients) and the other was control group (7 family doctors and 419 patients). The quality improvement intervention consisted of a combined program comprising audit, feedback, training sessions about main hypertension clinical guidelines during 6 months. The main measurement were blood pressure, lipid levels, diabetes, smoking and body index mass, antihypertensive drugs and record treatment adherence and therapeutic plan in march 2002 the baseline measurement and march 2004 the post intervention.
AB  - RESULTS: In study group blood pressure systolic and diastolic decreased 8.16/3.71 mmHg and control group increased 1.56/0.13 mmHg, respectively. The intervention effect was a drop of 9.72 mmHg (IC 95%: 7.50-11.94) and diastolic blood pressure in 3.84 mmHg (IC 95%: 2.40-5.28). The rate of hypertensive patients with blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg increased from 37.5% to 68.8% in study group, without changes in control group (p < 0.05). The drugs and combination drugs prescribed increased in both group, while the records of therapeutics plans and adherence increased only in intervention group (p < 0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The quality improvement intervention was associated to a systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction and a increase of rate patients with blood pressure controlled.

TI  - Hypothermia pediatric head injury trial: the value of a pretrial clinical evaluation phase.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The utility of a pretrial clinical evaluation or run-in phase prior to conducting trials of complex interventions such as hypothermia therapy following severe traumatic brain injury in children and adolescents has not been established.
AB  - METHODS: The primary objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the ability of investigators to adhere to the clinical protocols of care including the cooling and rewarming procedures as well as management guidelines in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale<or=8) treated with 24 h of hypothermia therapy. A secondary objective was to evaluate the ability of study research assistants to complete the study case report form using a procedures manual. The study was conducted at 18 sites in Canada, the United Kingdom and France prior to proceeding to a randomized controlled trial (RCT). After 2 patients were enrolled at each center, an independent clinical evaluation committee examined the process of care and the completeness of data collection. Centers were permitted to enroll patients in the RCT once they met pre-established adherence criteria.
AB  - RESULTS: Seventeen of the 18 centers completed the pretrial clinical evaluation phase demonstrating compliance with study procedures and proceeded to an RCT of hypothermia therapy. One center enrolled only 1 patient in the pretrial clinical evaluation phase due to small numbers of patients with traumatic brain injury, and therefore, did not proceed to the RCT. Three centers were required to enroll more than 2 patients in the pretrial clinical evaluation phase prior to proceeding to the RCT because of problems with adherence to the clinical protocols at two centers and the training of new study personnel at another center. Of the 39 patients enrolled during the pretrial clinical evaluation phase, 8 (20.5%) died and 22 (62.9%) had a good outcome defined as normal, mild or moderate disability assessed using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score at 6 months following injury.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The pretrial clinical evaluation phase was useful to ensure compliance with complex hypothermia therapy and consensus-based clinical management guidelines of care successfully implemented across 17 of 18 centers. This study maneuver allowed us to complete a subsequent RCT in 225 children following severe traumatic brain injury.Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac patients are encouraged to reduce their dietary fat intake, yet few studies have assessed fat intake in female cardiac patients.
AB  - AIM: We assessed changes in fat intake for female cardiac patients at four occasions during the first year following their event, and compared it with fat intake for a non-cardiac sample.
AB  - METHODS: The Short Fat Questionnaire (SFQ) was administered to 239 women aged 36 to 84 years consecutively admitted to four hospitals at the time of an acute event. Mplus was used to analyse change over time in SFQ scores and to identify predictors of change. Mean SFQ scores were compared with those for a sample of randomly selected Australian women and older adults.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean SFQ scores decreased substantially during the first two months (t(139) = 8.374, p < 0.001), then increased over the subsequent 10 months (t(146) = 4.656, p < 0.001). By 12 months, SFQ scores remained significantly lower than at baseline. Older women and those with hypertension showed less reduction in fat intake. At all four time-points, mean SFQ scores were significantly lower than those reported for other Australian women and older adults.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Even prior to their event, female cardiac patients reported lower fat intake than other Australian women and older adults, but showed partial deterioration in adherence following convalescence. Future studies could investigate options for assisting patients to sustain dietary changes, with attention to older patients and those with hypertension.

TI  - Improving blood pressure control through provider education, provider alerts, and patient education: a cluster randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate blood pressure control is a persistent gap in quality care.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate provider and patient interventions to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: 2 hospital-based and 8 community-based clinics in the Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System.
AB  - PATIENTS: 1341 veterans with essential hypertension cared for by 182 providers. Eligible patients had 2 or more blood pressure measurements greater than 140/90 mm Hg in a 6-month period and were taking a single antihypertensive agent.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Providers who cared for eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive an e-mail with a Web-based link to the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) guidelines (provider education); provider education and a patient-specific hypertension computerized alert (provider education and alert); or provider education, hypertension alert, and patient education, in which patients were sent a letter advocating drug adherence, lifestyle modification, and conversations with providers (patient education).
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Proportion of patients with a systolic blood pressure less than 140 mm Hg at 6 months; intensification of antihypertensive medication.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean baseline blood pressure was 157/83 mm Hg with no differences between groups (P = 0.105). Six-month follow-up data were available for 975 patients (73%). Patients of providers who were randomly assigned to the patient education group had better blood pressure control (138/75 mm Hg) than those in the provider education and alert or provider education alone groups (146/76 mm Hg and 145/78 mm Hg, respectively). More patients in the patient education group had a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or less compared with those in the provider education or provider education and alert groups (adjusted relative risk for the patient education group compared with the provider education alone group, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.06 to 1.62]; P = 0.012).
AB  - LIMITATIONS: Follow-up blood pressure measurements were missing for 27% of study patients. The study could not detect a mechanism by which patient education improved blood pressure control.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifactorial intervention including patient education improved blood pressure control compared with provider education alone.

TI  - Pharmacy- and community-based screenings for diabetes and cardiovascular conditions in high-risk individuals.[Erratum appears in J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash DC). 2006 Nov-Dec;46(6):666-7]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess a model to screen minority, elderly, and at-risk individuals for diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in pharmacy and non-health care settings.
AB  - DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, observational trial.
AB  - SETTING: 26 pharmacies and 4 non-health care settings.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 888 individuals with one or more of the following risk factors: first-degree relative with diabetes, age 55 years or older, obesity, previous diagnosis of hypertension, or a previous diagnosis of dyslipidemia.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Measurement of plasma glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and blood pressure; risk assessment using a risk factor tool; referral of participants with abnormalities to physicians.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence with follow-up, physician recommendations, and new diagnoses of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
AB  - RESULTS: Pharmacists screened 888 participants in pharmacies and non-health care settings; 794 scored at least 10 on the risk factor tool and received further screenings. Of these, 81% were referred for follow-up for at least one abnormality: 15% glucose, 68% blood pressure, 66% total cholesterol, and 26% HDL-C. For those referred, the mean (+/- SD) fasting plasma glucose concentration was 179 +/- 87 mg/dL, and the random glucose concentration was 234 +/- 90 mg/dL. Of participants completing follow-up, 16% received one or more new diagnoses as follows: diabetes, 8; hypertension, 9; and dyslipidemia, 29. Therapy changed for 42% of participants. Participants who were elderly, of African American and Hispanic race/ethnicity, or those with elevated cholesterol values were at significantly greater risk for elevated glucose levels. Screenings in community pharmacy settings had improved follow-up rates with physicians compared with screenings conducted in non-health care settings.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Pharmacists identified individuals with elevated glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure values through community-based screenings. Pharmacists also identified individuals who could benefit from further control of previously diagnosed hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

TI  - Can combining different risk interventions into a single formulation contribute to improved cardiovascular disease risk reduction? Rationale and design for an international, open-label program to assess the effectiveness of a single pill (amlodipine/atorvastatin) to attain recommended target levels for blood pressure and lipids (The JEWEL Program).
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to prevent cardiovascular events, it is essential to effectively manage overall risk of cardiovascular disease. However, despite guideline recommendations to this effect, current management of the major, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia is disconnected and patient adherence to therapy is poor. This is particularly important for patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, who are often prescribed multiple medications. The JEWEL study program will investigate the use of single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin as a strategy to improve management of these patients.
AB  - METHODS: The JEWEL program consists of two 16-week, international, open-label, multicenter, titration-to-goal studies in patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. The 2 studies differ based on country of enrollment and certain tertiary endpoints, but the overall designs are very similar. Patients have been enrolled from 255 centers across Canada and 13 European countries. The study is designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and utility of amlodipine/atorvastatin single-pill therapy in a real-world setting. Patients will be initiated at a dose of amlodipine 5 mg/atorvastatin 10 mg, unless previously treated, and will be uptitrated as necessary. The primary efficacy parameter is the percentage of patients, at different levels of cardiovascular risk, achieving country-specific guideline-recommended target levels for blood pressure and lipids. A secondary analysis of efficacy measured attainment of the same single goal for blood pressure across all study participants (JEWEL I and II) and the same single goal for LDL-C across all study participants (JEWEL I and II). The program will utilize a newly developed questionnaire to gain better understanding of participants' beliefs and behaviors towards medical treatment of their multiple risk factors. Approximately 2850 patients will be enrolled in the program, which is due to be completed in August 2005.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The JEWEL program will assess the effectiveness of a single pill (amlodipine/atorvastatin) in targeting the two principal risk factors for cardiovascular disease simultaneously to achieve nationally applicable treatment targets in a routine clinical practice setting.

TI  - Assessment of patients' and physicians' compliance to an ACE inhibitor treatment based on urinary N-acetyl Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro determination in the Noninsulin-Dependent Diabetes, Hypertension, Microalbuminuria, Proteinuria, Cardiovascular Events, and Ramipril (DIABHYCAR) study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess patients' and physicians' compliance with ACE inhibitor treatment, by measuring an endogenous biomarker of ACE inhibition, urinary N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP), in the Noninsulin-Dependent Diabetes, Hypertension, Microalbuminuria, Proteinuria, Cardiovascular Events, and Ramipril (DIABHYCAR) trial, which compared ramipril (1.25 mg o.d.) with placebo in 4,912 patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria/proteinuria.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The urine AcSDKP-to-creatinine ratio was measured blind to treatment in all participants who completed follow-up and provided spot urine samples (n = 1,871).
AB  - RESULTS: The median urinary AcSDKP-to-creatinine ratio was six times higher for ramipril than for placebo. Urinary AcSDKP-to-creatinine ratios displayed a bimodal distribution in both groups, with a very large intergroup overlap. Based on cluster analysis, we defined truly adherent ramipril patients as those with a ratio > or =4 nmol/mmol and truly adherent placebo patients as those with a ratio < 4 nmol/mmol. After excluding patients withdrawing prematurely from the study or known to have used a nonstudy ACE inhibitor, 27.3% of the 597 ramipril patients had ratios <4, indicating poor compliance, and 9.7% of the 621 placebo patients had ratios > or =4, indicating intake of a nonstudy ACE inhibitor. Correcting for compliance by using AcSDKP-guided analysis affected surrogate outcome results (decrease in systolic blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion) only slightly.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The systematic use of spot urinary AcSDKP determination facilitated the detection of defects in compliance with ACE inhibitor treatment in both patients and physicians. Urinary AcSDKP measurement could be a useful biomarker for assessing compliance with ACE inhibition in the routine care of diabetic patients.

TI  - Adherence to antihypertensive medication assessed by self-report was associated with electronic monitoring compliance.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clinicians often find it difficult to differentiate between subobtimal adherence and nonresponse to medical treatment if a patient's clinical condition does not improve. This study aimed to evaluate an adherence self-report tool to assess adherence to blood pressure lowering medication.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Participants were 245 patients with uncontrolled hypertension from 21 general practices taking part in a randomized trial. Prior to randomization, participants were asked to indicate which of six descriptions (adherence levels) would most closely describe their medication taking and were given electronic medication monitors for 30 days. We used multivariable regression analysis to compare the adherence self-report tool with electronic monitoring.
AB  - RESULTS: There was strong evidence that a drop in one adherence level from level 1 (highest level) to level 2 and from level 2 to level 3-6 (six being the lowest) combined was associated with a decrease in timing compliance of approximately 5% (test for trend: P = 0.0004).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Adherence assessed by a brief self-report tool was associated with timing compliance obtained through electronic monitoring in patients taking blood pressure lowering medication. Further research is required to investigate the validity of this tool in patients with lower adherence levels and in a nontrial population.

TI  - Hemodynamic responses to a community-based Tai Chi exercise intervention in ethnic Chinese adults with cardiovascular disease risk factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among older adults worldwide, including Europe, Asia, and North America. In the United States (US), CVD is also the leading cause of death among Asian-Americans. Physical activity has been shown to reduce CVD risk factors. Reduction in blood pressure (BP) in response to Tai Chi (TC) exercise in persons with CVD risk factors have been reported, though not in ethnic Chinese living in the US.
AB  - AIM: Hemodynamic responses to a 12-week community-based TC exercise intervention among ethnic Chinese with CVD risk factors were examined.
AB  - METHODS: Quasi-experimental design. Ethnic Chinese > 45 years old with at least 1 major CVD risk factor, living in the San Francisco Bay Area, attended a TC intervention three times a week for 12 weeks. A 2-min step-in-place test assessed aerobic endurance. BP and heart rate were measured at rest, and within 1-min after the step-test. Data were collected at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 39 subjects (69% women), 66 +/- 8.3 years old, with hypertension (92%), hypercholesteremia (49%), and/or diabetes (21%), and 1 current smoker participated. Adherence to the intervention was high (87%). Subjects were sedentary at baseline, though had a statistically significant improvement in aerobic endurance over-time (eta2 = 0.39). At baseline, the average BP at rest was 150/86, while BP in response to the step-test was 178/99. Clinically and statistically significant reductions in BP at rest (131/77), and in response to the step-test (164/82) were found over 12 weeks of TC (p < 0.01). No significant change in heart rate was observed.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This innovative, culturally relevant, community-based 12-week TC exercise intervention, appealed to Chinese adults with CVD risk factors, with significant reductions in BP and improvement in aerobic endurance. Given the number of persons estimated to have HTN and other CVD risk factors, the identification of new approaches to improve health, combined with risk factor reduction is needed. This is particularly important, given the rise in HTN among adults in the US and the associated public health burden of HTN. TC has the potential to reduce expenditures associated with CVD by facilitating a lifestyle that promotes physical activity, while remaining a low-tech, low-cost alternative to exercise.

TI  - [Implementation of clinical guidelines in general practice. The effect of journal audit and continuing education for the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with and without type 2 diabetes]. [Danish]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were, first, to describe the status of implementation of clinical guidelines for prevention of ischaemic heart disease in subjects with arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes, but without known cardiovascular disease, and, second, to describe the changes in treatment following journal audit and education of GPs.
AB  - MATERIAL AND METHODS: 230 general practitioners (GPs) were invited to include 20 consecutive at-risk patients. One year after the first data collection of 3,555 patients by 182 GPs, a new set of 3,023 patients was collected by 170 GPs from a new patient population. In the period between the two surveys, the GPs were educated through workshops and an international meeting focusing on cardiovascular risk factor treatment.
AB  - RESULTS: The quality of the care being delivered was suboptimal. Approximately 15-40% of the patients had obtained the treatment goals for hypertension, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes. Some improvement was demonstrated following education and journal audit, but a gap still exists between the recommended treatment and the treatment patients actually receive.
AB  - CONCLUSION: There is a need for improvement in the implementation of clinical guidelines focusing on diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Pharmaceutical care program for patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Report of a double-blind clinical trial with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical care programs may be an option to improve blood pressure (BP) control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of pharmaceutical care programs in treating patients with resistant hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: In a double-blind randomized clinical trial, 71 patients with uncontrolled BP were enrolled in a pharmaceutical care program or in a control group and underwent a series of cognitive tests. The primary outcome was change in ambulatory BP (ABP) between the baseline evaluation and the final visit 6 months later. The secondary outcomes were the frequency of drug-related problems and adherence as determined by plasma levels of hydrochlorothiazide.
AB  - RESULTS: The delta-values between the intervention and control groups for ABP in the different daily periods, with the corresponding 95% confidence limits, adjusted for age and baseline BP were: 3 (-1 to 5), 2 (-2 to 4), and 5 (-1 to 6) mm Hg for 24 h, daily and nightly systolic BP, respectively. The corresponding values for diastolic BP were 1 (-1 to 3), 0 (-2 to 2), and 3 (-1 to 4) mm Hg, respectively. Hydrochlorothiazide was detected in the plasma in 21 of 27 patients in the intervention group that attended to all appointments and 24 of 30 patients in the control group (P = .904).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The pharmaceutical care program tested in this trial was feasible and showed a trend for better BP control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether a one-year, multifaceted quality improvement intervention improved adherence to 13 clinical guidelines for lipid screening, hypertension management, and diabetes management among White and African-American adult patients.
AB  - SETTING: An academic family medicine center.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Six faculty physicians and a clinical pharmacist participated between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2003. Data from 2860 patients' electronic medical records were abstracted.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Performance reports and lists of patients eligible for each guideline measure were generated. Interventions targeted patients who needed improvement. Statistical analyses used generalized estimating equations to determine the intervention effect.
AB  - RESULTS: Significant improvements occurred in blood pressure control for all adults (OR= 1.44) and those with hypertension (OR=1.82), measures of total cholesterol (OR=1.10) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR= 1.27) for all patients, and measure of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR=2.01) and blood pressure control (OR=1.71) for patients with diabetes mellitus. Significant decline was seen in measures of blood pressure for all patients (OR=.60). After adjusting for patient demographic factors, provider variability, and comorbidities, race was not associated with the change observed in any of the measures from baseline to follow-up.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Even though a multifaceted intervention can improve process of care measures for Whites and African Americans, further studies are needed to improve outcome measures, especially in African Americans.

TI  - Bromide as a marker to measure adherence to drug therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several methods have been described to measure adherence to prescribed drug therapy. However, most of these have been shown to be inaccurate. Bromide is an anion that is readily absorbed in the gut and has an elimination half-life of about 12 days. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacokinetic properties of bromide with the objective to use it as a measure of drug adherence.
AB  - METHODS: Three groups of each 8 healthy volunteers took 15, 24 or 30 mg potassium bromide, respectively, daily for 20 weeks. Serum concentrations of bromide were measured every two weeks.
AB  - RESULTS: There was a linear relationship between the daily dosage taken and the mean increase of bromide concentration. In every group considerable inter-individual variability was seen. Correction for body weight resulted in an improved correlation between daily bromide dose and increase in concentration (r=0.78, p<0.01).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Unfortunately, the inter-individual variability in clearance of bromide was considerable. This limits the use of bromide to primarily measuring adherence in individual patients during long term follow-up. Bromide appears to be a potentially useful marker to be added to drugs for assessment of individual adherence to long term drug therapy. This needs to be investigated in various patients, particularly for patients with relatively asymptomatic diseases (e.g. hypertension).

TI  - Therapy modifications in response to poorly controlled hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poorly controlled cardiovascular risk factors are common. Evaluating whether physicians respond appropriately to poor risk factor control in patients may better reflect quality of care than measuring proportions of patients whose conditions are controlled.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate therapy modifications in response to poor control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes in a large clinical population.
AB  - DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study within an 18-month period in 2002 to 2003.
AB  - SETTING: Kaiser Permanente of Northern California.
AB  - PATIENTS: 253,238 adult members with poor control of 1 or more of these conditions.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: The authors assessed the proportion of patients with poor control who experienced a change in pharmacotherapy within 6 months, and they defined "appropriate care" as a therapy modification or return to control without therapy modification within 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 64% of patients experienced modifications in therapy for poorly controlled systolic blood pressure, 71% for poorly controlled diastolic blood pressure, 56% for poorly controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and 66% for poorly controlled hemoglobin A1c level. Most frequent modifications were increases in number of drug classes (from 70% to 84%) and increased dosage (from 15% to 40%). An additional 7% to 11% of those with poorly controlled blood pressure, but only 3% to 4% of those with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level or hemoglobin A1c level, returned to control without therapy modification. Patients with more than 1 of the 3 conditions, higher baseline values, and target organ damage were more likely to receive "appropriate care."
AB  - LIMITATIONS: Patient preferences and suboptimal adherence to therapy were not measured and may explain some failures to act.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: As an additional measure of the quality of care, measuring therapy modifications in response to poor control in a large population is feasible. Many patients with poorly controlled hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes had their therapy modified and, thus, seemed to receive clinically "appropriate care" with this new quality measure.

TI  - Factors associated with drug adherence and blood pressure control in patients with hypertension.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine characteristics associated with drug adherence and blood pressure control among patients with hypertension, and to assess agreement between self-reported and refill adherences.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from an ongoing randomized controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Primary care center at an urban, county health system in Indianapolis, Indiana.
AB  - PATIENTS: Four hundred ninety-two participants with hypertension and taking at least one antihypertensive drug.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Social and demographic factors, comorbidity, self-reported drug adherence, prescription refill adherence, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded at baseline. Participants were aged 57 +/- 11 (mean +/- SD) years, were predominantly women (73%) and African-American (68%), and took 2.4 +/- 1.1 antihypertensive drugs. Agreement between self-reported and refill adherences was poor to fair (kappa = 0.21). On multiple logistic regression analysis, increased age (p< or =0.002) and being married (p=0.03) were independent predictors of improved self-reported and refill adherence, whereas depressed patients had low self-reported adherence (p=0.005), and African-Americans had low refill adherence (p<0.001). Compared with nonadherent patients, adherent patients had lower systolic (-5.4 mm Hg by self-report and -5.0 mm Hg by refill) and diastolic (-2.7 mm Hg by self-report and -3.0 mm Hg by refill) blood pressures (p< or =0.02). Increased age was the only other variable strongly associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure control in both measures of drug adherence (p< or =0.001). The association of depression, race, and sex with blood pressure control was model dependent.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Age, sex, race and depression are associated with antihypertensive drug adherence and blood pressure control. Self-reported and refill adherences appear to provide complementary information and are associated with reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of similar magnitude.

TI  - A systematic review of the effects of home blood pressure monitoring on medication adherence. [Review] [27 refs]
AB  - Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) improves blood pressure control, but little is known about its effects on medication adherence. The authors conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the effects of HBPM on medication adherence. Of 440 abstracts and citations reviewed, 11 randomized control trials met predefined criteria. Six of the 11 randomized controlled trials reported statistically significant improvement in medication adherence; 84% of these were complex interventions involving the use of HBPM in combination with other adherence-enhancing strategies such as patient counseling by nurses, pharmacists, or a telephone-linked system; patient education; and the use of timed medication reminders. Interventions conducted in primary care settings were not effective compared with those that occurred in hospital-based clinics or nonclinical settings. The data on the effects of HBPM on patients' medication-taking behavior are mixed. Future studies should investigate the independent effects of HBPM in primary care practices where the majority of hypertensive patients receive their care. [References: 27]

TI  - Blood pressure rise with swimming versus walking in older women: the Sedentary Women Exercise Adherence Trial 2 (SWEAT 2).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Swimming is often recommended in the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Few studies have investigated the effect of swimming training on blood pressure (BP). Our objective was to evaluate 6 months of supervised moderate swimming or walking on BP in previously sedentary, normotensive, older women.
AB  - DESIGN: Women aged 50-70 years (n = 116) were randomly assigned to a supervised 6-month swimming or walking programme. They were further randomized to receive usual care or a behavioural intervention package.
AB  - METHODS: Exercise comprised 3 sessions/week with a warm-up, cool down, and 30-min of moderate intensity walking or swimming. BP was recorded for 20 min supine, and 5 min standing. Assessments were made at 0 and 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: At baseline, mean supine BP (+/- SD) was 115.7 +/- 1.3/66.8 +/- 0.7 mmHg. Swimming improved swim distance by 78.1 m (29.3%) [95% confidence interval (CI); 66.7, 89.4] and walk time by 0.58 min (3.8%) (0.41, 0.74). Walking decreased walk time by 1.0 min (6.5%) (0.81, 1.19). After adjustment for initial BP, age, hypertension treatment status and change in weight, swimming increased supine and standing systolic BP relative to walking by 4.4 mmHg (1.2, 7.5) (P = 0.008) and 6.0 mmHg (2.6, 9.5) (P = 0.001), respectively. Supine and standing diastolic BP increased by 1.4 mmHg (-0.14, 3.0) (P = 0.07) and 1.8 mmHg (-0.02, 3.5) (P = 0.05), respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Relative to moderately paced walking, regular swimming significantly elevates BP in previously sedentary, normotensive, older women. This finding may have important implications for exercise prescription in older subjects.

TI  - Longitudinal study on hypertension control in primary care: the Insubria study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension control is still unsatisfactory. The study was aimed to evaluate blood pressure (BP) control rate and the impact of training general practitioners (GPs) about hypertension 1999 World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension guidelines.
AB  - METHODS: After a training session on the hypertension guidelines, 588 GPs consecutively enrolled 5524 known hypertensive patients. During the first and follow-up visits (after 3, 6, and 9 months) GPs recorded BP, lifestyle habits, and drug therapy.
AB  - RESULTS: The BP was controlled in 33.4%, with systolic BP less controlled than diastolic BP. The BP control rate decreased (P < .001) from low to very high cardiovascular risk group and from lean to overweight and obese subjects. At the first visit 97.3% of the patients were already on drug treatment: 40.3% with 1 drug, 38.9% with 2 drugs, 17.2% with 3 drugs and 3.6% with 4 or 5 drugs. The adherence to correct dietary and lifestyle habits was low. The drugs most often used were the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (3009 patients, 56%). During follow-up body weight and BP decreased; 1 or more drugs were added in 17.8% and the adherence to healthier lifestyle habits significantly increased. At the end of the survey BP control rate was significantly improved (52.7%).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In primary care the hypertension control rate was still unsatisfactory, and our data suggest that it may be due to a not aggressive enough drug treatment and a low adherence to recommended lifestyle and dietary habits. Increasing the knowledge of GPs about guidelines was associated with an improvement of hypertension control rate.

TI  - Racial differences in blood pressure control: potential explanatory factors.
AB  - PURPOSE: Poor blood pressure control remains a common problem that contributes to significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly among African Americans. We explored antihypertensive medication adherence and other factors that may explain racial differences in blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: Baseline data were obtained from the Veteran's Study to Improve The Control of Hypertension, a randomized controlled trial designed to improve blood pressure control. Clinical, demographic, and psychosocial factors relating to blood pressure control were examined.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 569 patients who were African American (41%) or white (59%) were enrolled in the study. African Americans were more likely to have inadequate baseline blood pressure control than whites (63% vs 50%; odds ratio = 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-2.41). Among 20 factors related to blood pressure control, African Americans also had a higher odds ratio of being nonadherent to their medication, being more functionally illiterate, and having a family member with hypertension compared with whites. Compared with whites, African Americans also were more likely to perceive high blood pressure as serious and to experience the side effect of increased urination compared with whites. Adjusting for these differences reduced the odds ratio of African Americans having adequate blood pressure control to 1.59 (95% confidence interval 1.09-2.29).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of hypertensive patients who have good access to health care and medication benefits, African Americans continued to have lower levels of blood pressure control despite considering more than 20 factors related to blood pressure control. Interventions designed to improve medication adherence need to take race into account. Patients' self-reports of failure to take medications provide an opportunity for clinicians to explore reasons for medication nonadherence, thereby improving adherence and potentially blood pressure control.

TI  - Barriers to and strategies for effective blood pressure control.
AB  - There are major differences between the current knowledge of the treatment of cardiac conditions derived from evidence-based medicine and the widespread application of this knowledge. This is particularly true in the treatment of hypertension. Hypertension is the most common chronic cardiovascular condition, affecting more than 50 million Americans and approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. However, many hypertensive patients are not receiving treatment, and of those that are, many are not adequately controlled. There is evidence that there are methods to improve blood pressure control and improve compliance with expert recommendations for the treatment of hypertension. These methods range from local initiatives such as academic detailing to national performance measures as have been developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs. A challenge for the future will be to identify and broadly apply these and other programs to improve the quality and efficiency of hypertensive treatment.

TI  - Can hand-held computers improve adherence to guidelines? A (Palm) Pilot study of family doctors in British Columbia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether Palm Prevention, a free software tool for Palm OS personal digital assistants (PDAs) that provides quick access to preventive guidelines in a patient-specific manner at the point of care, improved adherence to five preventive measures in primary care.
AB  - DESIGN: Prospective intervention pilot study.
AB  - SETTING: Vancouver, BC, and surrounding area.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Eight general practitioners.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Each physician used Palm Prevention for five preventive measures during routine preventive health visits with 10 patients (n = 80). Charts of consenting patients were reviewed for documentation of recommended maneuvers.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of adherence to five evidence-based guidelines selected from the Canadian and American task forces on preventive care and incorporated into Palm Prevention.
AB  - RESULTS: Intervention and control physicians were similar in their familiarity with and use of PDAs, and they recruited similar patients for the study. Intervention and control groups had similar rates of screening for hypertension. Intervention improved adherence to the remaining four guidelines: cervical cancer screening increased 22% (only absolute increases are reported); hyperlipidemia screening increased 30%; colorectal cancer screening increased 27%; and prophylaxis with acetylsalicylic acid in high-risk patients increased 38%. Participants were surveyed after the study; all reported that they found the software helpful and would continue using Palm Prevention. Usage statistics showed that study participants used the tool outside the trial: users entered between 28 and 68 unique patients into the program during the 2-month intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests PDAs are useful in improving preventive care and facilitating translation of knowledge into practice. This was particularly apparent with newer guidelines.

TI  - [Treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A-reductase inhibitors in elderly patients: is it necessary?]. [Romanian]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the benefit of the therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (simvastatin) associated with diet in treating dyslipidemia in elderly patients, considering that they are more exposed to sudden death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Efficient and long-term serum cholesterol concentration lowering has beneficial effects on the risk for coronary heart disease as well as on other major cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes.
AB  - METHODS: A retrospective study of 84 patients aged > or = 65 years, admitted in the last 6 months in Medical Clinic IV, was conducted. Admission criteria in the study were: age > or = 65 years old and high serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. The patient population was divided into two groups: Group I of 40 patients treated for dyslipidemia only with diet and Group II with 44 patients in which was associated treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, 10 mg/day. The patients were controlled when admitted in the study and then at 3 and 6 weeks afterwards.
AB  - RESULTS: Serum cholesterol and triglycerides concentration lowering was modest in Group I at 3 and 6 weeks, maybe because we registered a progressively lowered compliance of patients to hypocholesterolemic diet. In Group II the results were much better as we obtained significant serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels lowering after 3 weeks of treatment, and in 32 cases (72%) we had a normal lipid profile after 6 weeks of treatment. The other 12 patients (28%) abandoned treatment after 4 weeks of therapy because of financial reasons. There were no side effects during the treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors associated to hypocholesterolemic diet controlled efficiently dyslipidemia in elderly patients. Diet alone could not control cholesterol and triglycerides levels, mainly because of lack of adherence of the patients to the diet. Based on the fact that dyslipidemia is a major, independent cardiovascular risk factor, we consider that therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A-reductase inhibitors is beneficial in elderly patients because of their efficacity, minimal side effects and protection against sudden death, myocardial infarction and stroke.

TI  - Improving adherence to guidelines for hypertension drug prescribing: cluster-randomized controlled trial of general versus patient-specific recommendations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention focusing clinician attention on drug choice for hypertension treatment improves concordance between drug regimens and guidelines.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing an individualized intervention with a general guideline implementation in geographically diverse primary care clinics of a university-affiliated Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system.
AB  - METHODS: Participants were 36 attending physicians and nurse practitioners (16 in the general group and 20 in the individualized group), with findings based on 4500 hypertensive patients. A general guideline implementation for all clinicians, including education about guideline-based drug recommendations and goals for adequacy of blood pressure control, was compared with addition of a printed individualized advisory sent to clinicians at each patient visit, indicating whether or not the patient's antihypertensive drug regimen was guideline concordant. We measured change from baseline to end point in the proportion of clinicians' patients whose drug therapy was guideline concordant.
AB  - RESULTS: The individualized intervention resulted in an improvement in guideline concordance more than twice that observed for the general intervention (10.9% vs 3.8%, t = 2.796, P = .008). Bootstrap analysis showed that being in the individualized group increased the odds of concordance 1.5-fold (P = .025). The proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control increased within each study group; however, the difference between groups was not significant.
AB  - CONCLUSION: An individualized advisory regarding drug therapy for hypertension given to the clinician at each patient visit was more effective in changing clinician prescribing behavior than implementation of a general guideline.

TI  - Adherence to an exercise prescription scheme: the role of expectations, self-efficacy, stage of change and psychological well-being.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Poor rates of adherence to exercise prescription schemes present a potential barrier to the goal of increasing physical activity in patient samples. This study investigated the role of participant expectations, self-efficacy, stage of change and psychological well-being in adherence to a 12-week course of gym based exercise. It also aimed to assess the impact of failure to adhere on self-efficacy and psychological well-being.
AB  - METHOD: The 119 participants, referred by their medical practitioner for a course of exercise, completed questionnaires at the start of the course and 77 went on to complete second questionnaires. Objective measures included a range of physiological measures based on gym assessments.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants typically had high expectations of the scheme. Those who completed the course had more modest expectations of change and came closer to achieving these expected changes than those who dropped out. Initial stage of change and self-efficacy did not discriminate between the two groups. While self-efficacy improved over the scheme for completers, it tended to deteriorate for drop-outs. GHQ scores also failed to improve over time for drop-outs.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Overly optimistic expectations of inexperienced exercisers may lead to disappointment and attrition. Interventions to ensure realistic expectations might increase success and prevent potential negative effects of failure.

TI  - Effectiveness of a multidisciplinary kidney disease clinic in achieving treatment guideline targets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have demonstrated previously that at referral most chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have suboptimal metabolic and hypertension control. Although several studies suggest that CKD clinics improve patient outcome, in fact there are minimal published data describing the actual effect of such clinics on these parameters.
AB  - METHODS: We performed a historical prospective review of a cohort of 340 CKD patients referred to our multidsciplinary clinic in 1998 or 1999, with estimated creatinine clearance (CCr) <60 ml/min. Data regarding blood pressure (BP) control, metabolic/anaemia parameters, medications, access planning and dialysis starts were collected.
AB  - RESULTS: The number of patients followed was 234, 144, 100 and 70 at years 1-4 of follow-up, respectively. Twenty-five percent of the patients were diabetic, and 25% were suspected to have ischaemic nephropathy; mean age was 67+/-15 years. Although phosphate control improved from referral, below a CCr of 30 ml/min, 27% of visits showed hyperphosphataemia. Thirty-one percent of patients with CCr <15 ml/min had haemoglobin <100 g/l at follow-up despite the availability of erythropoietin. BP improved from a mean of 151/80 mmHg at referral to 137/75 mmHg in subsequent visits. At follow-up visits, 62% of BPs were still >130 mmHg systolic or 85 mmHg diastolic. For proteinuric patients (>1 g/day), 75% of follow-up visits showed BP >125/75 mmHg, despite angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use increasing from 35% at referral to 79% at follow-up. Twenty-four percent of patients started renal replacement therapy, initially haemodialysis (HD) in 57%, peritoneal dialysis (PD) in 35% and pre-emptive transplant in 8%. Thirty-eight percent of dialysis starts occurred within 6 months of referral, but PD was the modality in half of these. Only half of the HD patients started using an aterio-venous fistula, and of those using a central catheter 11 of 24 had been followed >6 months, but only four of them had attempted fistula creation.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: CKD clinic attendance was associated with improvements in metabolic and BP control, and was able to facilitate the use of PD even for late referrals. However, even the multidisciplinary model with nephrologists, nurse educators and dietitians was unable to achieve guideline-recommended metabolic, anaemia, BP and access targets for a significant number of patients.

TI  - Failure of Internet-based audit and feedback to improve quality of care delivered by primary care residents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of Internet-based audit and feedback to physicians to improve care for diabetes and hypertension.
AB  - DESIGN: Time-series analysis of an intervention.
AB  - METHODS: The study setting was Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, a 14-site multispecialty group in greater Boston. The study period was July 1997-June 1999.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: were 12 primary care internal medicine residents who provided care to adult patients with diabetes (n = 76 pre-intervention and n = 88 post-intervention), hypertension (n = 329 pre-intervention and n = 338 post-intervention), or both (n = 62 pre-intervention and n = 71 post-intervention). We determined the proportion of each resident's patients whose care fulfilled national guidelines for quality (i.e. diabetes patients had hemoglobin testing in the previous 6 months or hypertension patients received a beta-blocker or diuretic in the same time period). After meeting individually with each resident to obtain informed consent and to encourage participation, we sent each resident information for accessing his or her practice profile on a secure website. The main outcome measures were (i) the proportion of resident physicians who accessed their profiles and (ii) change following the intervention in the proportion of patients whose care followed national guidelines.
AB  - RESULTS: Over a 1-year period, only four of the 12 residents accessed their websites. One of the residents visited her site three times, while the other three residents visited their sites once each. In interrupted time-series analyses, the intervention had no discernible effect on adherence to practice guidelines for diabetes or hypertension.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The lack of participation in this Internet-based intervention may have important implications for the development of future programs that require physicians to interact with technology to improve quality of care.

TI  - ADVANCE: action in diabetes and vascular disease. [Review] [28 refs]
AB  - The burden of Type II diabetes is growing rapidly worldwide, across high-, middle- and low-income countries. This burden is associated primarily with increased risks of macrovascular and microvascular diseases, and it is agreed that multifactorial treatment regimens are required to reduce it. ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation) is a large-scale, 2 x 2 factorial, randomised clinical trial. It will investigate the potential benefits of blood pressure lowering, using a fixed low-dose combination of perindopril and indapamide vs placebo, and of tighter glucose control, using an intensive gliclazide-MR-based glucose control regimen vs a standard guidelines-based regimen, separately and together. The two primary outcomes are a composite macrovascular end point of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death; and a composite microvascular end point of new or worsening nephropathy or microvascular eye disease. Following successful recruitment and randomisation of 11,140 participants by March 2003, the study is currently half way through its planned follow-up of 4.5 years. Adherence to randomised study treatment is good; and loss to follow-up is minimal. It is hoped that the study will answer a number of unresolved issues. The blood pressure lowering arm will investigate the possible reduction in major vascular disease in patients with Type II diabetes whether or not they have hypertension, and the possible benefits of blood pressure lowering in such patients already receiving background therapy with the ACE inhibitor perindopril. The glucose control arm will investigate the possible reduction in both macrovascular and microvascular disease achieved with tighter glucose control, targeting an HbA1c of 6.5% and a fasting blood glucose of 6.0 mmol/l. Finally, the factorial design will enable investigation of the combined effects of more intensive glucose control and tighter control of blood pressure. [References: 28]

TI  - Serotonin transporter polymorphisms affect human blood glucose control.
AB  - We measured the effect of nutritional intervention on clinical data, including fasting blood glucose (FBG), and their association with polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) which might affect adherence. Enrolled in the intervention program were 264 Japanese women not on medication for diabetes, hypercholesterolemia or hypertension. The 5-HTTLPR allele (S and L) frequencies among the subjects differed markedly from those of Caucasians: SS (n = 183), LS (n = 69), and LL (n = 12). The decrease in FBG (DeltaFBG) from the beginning to the end of the program (11 weeks; short-term study), and DeltaFBG from the beginning to a follow-up check performed between 2002 and 2004 (average of 23 years later; long-term study) was calculated. The SS homozygotes of 5-HTTLPR showed larger DeltaFBG (P = 0.01 and P < 0.0001 in the short- and long-term studies, respectively) than DeltaFBG with other genotypes.

TI  - Positive benefits of a pharmacist-managed hypertension clinic in Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the provision of further practice-based support by pharmacists will bring about improved outcomes for blood pressure (BP) control in middle-aged and elderly Nigerian hypertensive patients managed with combination diuretics (amiloride hydrochloride 5 mg+hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg) and/or methyl dopa at the primary care level.
AB  - DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a 1-year prospective, randomized cohort study of the outpatients of a state comprehensive health centre in South-western Nigeria. Free primary health services including free drugs were provided for all patients.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHOD: The study population comprised 51 Nigerian patients with uncomplicated hypertension aged 45 years or more, with a 0.2-3.0-year history of hypertension, registered at the Comprehensive Health Centre, Ife between October 2002 and March 2003. They were invited into the pharmacist-managed hypertension clinic and followed for the study period. Participating pharmacists counselled for current medication, personalized goals of lifestyle modification stressing weight loss and/or increased activity, increased patient awareness by providing relevant education about hypertension and associated/related diseases, adjusted drug therapy to optimize effectiveness and minimize adverse events, utilized treatment schedules that enhanced patients' adherence to therapy, and monitored treatment outcomes between enrollment and return visits. Patient satisfaction and the number of treatment failures within 6 months post enrollment were compared with retrospective data from our earlier study involving physician-managed patients under a similar setting.
AB  - RESULTS: Uncontrolled BP reduced from 92 to 36.2% by 10.15+/-5.02 days after enrollment. Treatment failures were observed at 5.9% of the total return visits (n=184) within 6 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-managed hypertension clinics can improve BP control, reduce treatment failure and increase patient satisfaction.

TI  - Who's really hypertensive?--Quality control issues in the assessment of blood pressure for randomized trials.
AB  - The characterization of blood pressure in treatment trials assessing the benefits of blood pressure lowering regimens is a critical factor for the appropriate interpretation of study results. With numerous operators involved in the measurement of blood pressure in many thousands of patients being screened for entry into clinical trials, it is essential that operators follow pre-defined measurement protocols involving multiple measurements and standardized techniques. Blood pressure measurement protocols have been developed by international societies and emphasize the importance of appropriate choice of cuff size, identification of Korotkoff sounds, and digit preference. Training of operators and auditing of blood pressure measurement may assist in reducing the operator-related errors in measurement. This paper describes the quality control activities adopted for the screening stage of the 2nd Australian National Blood Pressure Study (ANBP2). ANBP2 is cardiovascular outcome trial of the treatment of hypertension in the elderly that was conducted entirely in general practices in Australia. A total of 54 288 subjects were screened; 3688 previously untreated subjects were identified as having blood pressure >140/90 mmHg at the initial screening visit, 898 (24%) were not eligible for study entry after two further visits due to the elevated reading not being sustained. For both systolic and diastolic blood pressure recording, observed digit preference fell within 7 percentage points of the expected frequency. Protocol adherence, in terms of the required minimum blood pressure difference between the last two successive recordings, was 99.8%. These data suggest that adherence to blood pressure recording protocols and elimination of digit preferences can be achieved through appropriate training programs and quality control activities in large multi-centre community-based trials in general practice. Repeated blood pressure measurement prior to initial diagnosis and study entry is essential to appropriately characterize hypertension in these elderly patients.

AB  - This study is a 3-year follow-up of a factorial randomised controlled trial of two decision aids - decision analysis and information video plus leaflet - for newly diagnosed hypertensive patients. We found no evidence of differences for either of the two decision aids compared with controls for the primary outcome of blood pressure control at follow-up. There were also no differences in any of the secondary outcomes measured - the proportion taking blood pressure lowering drugs, self-reported medication adherence, or consulting behaviour. The randomised controlled trial cohort as a whole, irrespective of randomised group, demonstrated substantial reductions in blood pressure and 10-year cardiovascular risk over the follow-up period.

TI  - Intentional and unintentional nonadherence to antihypertensive medication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is poorly controlled in the US due to medication nonadherence. Recent evidence suggests that nonadherence can be classified as intentional or unintentional and different patient characteristics, such as the experience of adverse effects, may be associated with each.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between patient characteristics, including reported adverse effects, and both intentional and unintentional nonadherence among 588 hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: Baseline data from a clinical trial, the Veterans' Study To Improve the Control of Hypertension, were examined. Intentional and unintentional nonadherence were assessed using a self-report measure. Participants were presented with a list of adverse effects commonly associated with antihypertensive medication and asked to indicate which symptoms they had experienced. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine adjusted associations between patient characteristics and type of nonadherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Approximately 31% of patients reported unintentional nonadherence and 9% reported intentional nonadherence. Non-white participants, individuals without diabetes mellitus, and individuals reporting > or = 5 adverse effects were more likely to report intentional nonadherence than their counterparts. Individuals with less than a 10th-grade education and non-white participants were more likely to report unintentional nonadherence than their counterparts. When symptoms of increased urination and wheezing/shortness of breath were reported, patients were more likely to report intentional and unintentional nonadherence compared with those who were adherent. Unintentional nonadherence was also associated with reports of dizziness and rapid pulse.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Both intentional and unintentional nonadherence are common and related to perceived adverse effects. Furthermore, different interventions may be necessary to improve adherence in unintentionally and intentionally nonadherent patients.

TI  - Adherence to antihypertensive treatment: a critical factor for blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare rates of blood pressure (BP) control with the level of adherence to antihypertensive treatment and factors influencing compliance in Greek patients.
AB  - DESIGN: An observational cross-sectional study on 1000 consecutively treated hypertensive patients, admitted to a University department of general surgery in a Greek hospital.
AB  - METHODS: Patients were interviewed by the same doctor using pre-coded questionnaires with questions on demographic data, health and treatment status. Blood pressure was measured using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. Treatment of hypertension was defined as current use of antihypertensive medication. Compliance was defined as an affirmative reply to a number of questions regarding regular use of antihypertensive medication according to the physician's instructions.
AB  - RESULTS: Satisfactory BP control (levels <140/90 mmHg) was documented in only 20% of the treated hypertensives. Compliance to antihypertensive treatment was found in only 15% of the patients. Control of BP was positively associated with compliance. Compliance was more common among patients aged <60, city dwellers, the better educated, those more adequately counselled by their physicians and those followed by a private doctor. As regards treatment, compliance was better among those taking one antihypertensive tablet per day, those who had never changed their antihypertensive regimen and those who had never changed their doctor.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Compliance is associated with more effective BP control. Physicians can enhance patient compliance and hypertension control by devoting more time to counselling, avoiding unnecessary changes in drug regimens and restricting the tablet numbers.

TI  - Adherence to cardiovascular risk factor modification in patients with hypertension.
AB  - AIM: The effectiveness of the support of a healthcare practitioner and a family member in producing changes in cardiovascular risk factor modification was tested in a randomised, controlled trial in patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: The primary outcome measured after the 24-week intervention was blood pressure change. Secondary outcomes included patients' adherence to the programme, their knowledge about hypertension, exercise capacity, body weight, self-reported ability to control stress, adherence to medication and salt restriction, as well as symptoms.
AB  - RESULTS: There were no marked improvements in blood pressure regulation in either group. The differences between the experimental and control groups were 3 mmHg (CI -6.18-12.18) for systolic blood pressure and 4 mmHg (CI -1.48-9.48) for diastolic blood pressure. The estimated blood pressure effects were small increases in both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, due to larger changes in the control group. These small changes were of no clinical significance. This intervention was not successful in reducing blood pressure of hypertensive patients who participated in a lifestyle programme. Secondary outcomes did show positive changes as a result of the given intervention. The absolute difference in improvement between the two groups was significantly greater for the experimental group than for the control group for the following variables: 24% better adherence to the programme (p = 0.007); 10% higher mean percentage score of hypertension knowledge and its management (p = 0.04); 20% more patients could control their stress levels (p = 0.05); 26% more patients could control their salt ingestion (p = 0.02); and 20% had better adherence to their given medication regimen (p = 0.05). The experimental group had a statistically significant weight reduction of 1 (+/- 4) kg relative to the control group (p = 0.03). Both groups increased their exercise capacity during the trial (p = 0.03). On the completion of the intervention, significantly fewer patients in the experimental group than in the control complained of tiredness (p = 0.05). Patients who had a 75% adherence or more to the programme were found to have maintained their knowledge and their exercise capacity, but not their weight loss after a maintenance phase of 12 weeks, during which time there was no intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients in a supported environment such as the one in this study were able to modify their cardiovascular risk factors, even though there were non-significant changes in blood pressure reported in this study.

TI  - Use of an embedded N-of-1 trial to improve adherence and increase information from a clinical study.[Erratum appears in Contemp Clin Trials. 2006 Feb;27(1):101-2]
AB  - Withdrawal of participants from randomized trials can occur because of symptoms thought to be related to the study medicine, but the causal relationship between the study medicine and the symptoms is often unclear. Single-patient trials ("N-of-1 trials"), developed to identify optimal therapy for an individual patient in the clinical setting, may provide a means of resolving some of these dilemmas. We describe here the use of an N-of-1 study embedded within a placebo-controlled trial of saw palmetto for a participant who considered withdrawing because he believed the study medication caused an increase in his blood pressure. In this case, the N-of-1 study not only reassured the patient, who decided to remain in the study, but provided potentially useful new information regarding the study medication. Wider use of formal N-of-1 studies may be a valuable tool for improving adherence and determining whether observed side effects are caused by study medication in clinical trials.

TI  - Predictors of adherence with antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with comorbid hypertension and dyslipidemia are at high risk for cardiovascular disease, which can be considerably mitigated by treatment. Adherence with prescribed drug therapy is, therefore, especially important in these patients. This study was undertaken to describe the patterns and predictors of adherence with concomitant antihypertensive (AH) and lipid-lowering (LL) therapy.
AB  - METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined 8406 enrollees in a US managed care plan who initiated treatment with AH and LL therapy within a 90-day period. Adherence was measured as the proportion of days covered in each 3-month interval following initiation of concomitant therapy (mean follow-up, 12.9 months). Patients were considered adherent if they had filled prescriptions sufficient to cover at least 80% of days with both classes of medications. A multivariate regression model evaluated potential predictors of adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: The percentage of patients adherent with both AH and LL therapy declined sharply following treatment initiation, with 44.7%, 35.9%, and 35.8% of patients adherent at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, and other potential predictors, patients were more likely to be adherent if they initiated AH and LL therapy together, had a history of coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, or took fewer other medications.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adherence with concomitant AH and LL therapy is poor, with only 1 in 3 patients adherent with both medications at 6 months. Physicians may be able to significantly improve adherence by initiating AH and LL therapy concomitantly and by reducing pill burden.

TI  - Concordance among three self-reported measures of medication adherence and pharmacy refill records.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the level of agreement among three previously validated self-reported medication adherence measures and pharmacy refill records (RRs).
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
AB  - SETTING: Five primary care physician office sites in rural northeast Georgia.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 139 adult patients with one or more of these chronic diseases: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, or a condition requiring hormone replacement therapy.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Study participants completed the Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ), the Medication Adherence Survey (MAS), and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) instruments; pharmacy RRs for the medication or medications being used to treat the target disease were obtained from pharmacies used by the study participants.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence to medication therapy for target disease.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants were nearly all white (98.6%), consistent with the Appalachian area in which the study was conducted, and mostly women (71.9%). While 91.4% of study participants reported taking their study medication most or all of the time, RRs showed mean adherence rates of 82.6%, 82.1%, 79.1%, 74.6%, and 69.8% for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, and hormone replacement therapy, respectively. Moderate correlations of .234, .261, and .213 were found between RRs and the MAS, MOS, and BMQ belief screen, respectively. Spearman correlations ranged from .091 between RRs and the BMQ regimen subscale to .313 between MOS and MAS. Pearson chi-square tests showed that only the BMQ belief subscale was significant in this study.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Because of the weak to moderate concordance found among validated measures of adherence, the selection of a useful adherence measure in pharmacy practice is difficult. These findings underscore the difficulty in both assessing patients' medication-taking behavior and assessing and comparing the results of adherence research. The development of valid and reliable measures for easily assessing medication adherence behavior in community pharmacies is needed.

TI  - Group versus individual academic detailing to improve the use of antihypertensive medications in primary care: a cluster-randomized controlled trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare group versus individual academic detailing to increase diuretic or beta-blocker use in hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in a large health maintenance organization. Subjects (N=9820) were patients with newly treated hypertension in the year preceding the intervention (N=3692), the 9 months following the intervention (N=3556), and the second year following intervention (N=2572). We randomly allocated 3 practice sites to group detailing (N=227 prescribers), 3 to individual detailing (N=235 prescribers), and 3 to usual care (N=319 prescribers). Individual detailing entailed a physician-educator meeting individually with clinicians to address barriers to prescribing guideline-recommended medications. The group detailing intervention incorporated the same social marketing principles in small groups of clinicians.
AB  - RESULTS: In the first year following the intervention, the rates of diuretic or beta-blocker use increased by 13.2% in the group detailing practices, 12.5% in the individual detailing practices, and 6.2% in the usual care practices. As compared with usual care practices, diuretic or beta-blocker use was more likely in group detailing practices (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11 - 1.76) and individual detailing practices (adjusted OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.95 - 1.79). Neither intervention affected blood pressure control. Two years following this single-visit intervention, there was still a trend suggesting a persistent effect of individual (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.92 - 1.62), but not group, detailing (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.80 - 1.39), as compared with usual care.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Both group and individual academic detailing improved antihypertensive prescribing over and above usual care but may require reinforcement to sustain improvements.

TI  - Physician, organisational and patient characteristics explaining the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure treatment: a multilevel study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Heart failure treatment in general practice is not concordant with guideline recommendations. Insight into the key determinants at different levels is needed in order to improve care. The aim was to assess the influence of physician, organisational and patient characteristics on the treatment of chronic heart failure with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in primary care.
AB  - METHODS: Physician and organisational data were collected by means of a questionnaire. Patient and treatment data were extracted from electronic medical records. Multilevel analysis was used to assess the effect of physician, organisational and patient factors on the treatment with ACE inhibitors in terms of prescription rate and dosage.
AB  - RESULTS: Data from 735 randomly selected heart failure patients were extracted from the medical records of 95 general practitioners (GPs). Patients who visited a cardiologist or an outpatient heart failure clinic were more likely to receive an ACE inhibitor. In addition, relatively young patients, male patients and patients already using a diuretic were more likely to receive an ACE inhibitor. Furthermore, male patients and patients with concomitant hypertension were more likely to receive a higher dose of ACE inhibitor. GP characteristics did not determine whether CHF patients received ACE inhibitor treatment.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The differences in ACE inhibitor prescribing seem to be linked more to patient than physician characteristics. Interventions to improve the quality of care should therefore focus on the treatment of specific patient groups. Specialised care, particularly through outpatient clinics, could lead to improvement in the use of ACE inhibitors.

TI  - Introduction of diabetes passports involving both patients and professionals to improve hospital outpatient diabetes care.
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether a comprehensive strategy involving both patients and professionals, with the introduction of a diabetes passport as a key component, improves diabetes care.
AB  - METHODS: The first 150 consecutive patients who visited their internist for a diabetes check up at the internal medicine outpatient departments at each of nine Dutch general hospitals were included in this 1 year clustered, randomised, controlled trial. Health care professionals attended an educational meeting about the use and dissemination of the diabetes passport which is a patient held record. They also received aggregated feedback on baseline data and personal feedback. Educational meetings were also organised for patients. Patient files were used in conjunction with questionnaires to determine adherence rates. Data were analysed using multilevel regression analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Small but significant changes were found in mean HbA1c levels. In the intervention group, positive health changes for patients were found (-0.3%) when compared to those in the control group (+0.2%). Diastolic blood pressure improved slightly, but no changes were found in systolic blood pressure or cholesterol. Improvements were found with regard to levels of examination of patients' feet and in patient education.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve professional practice involving both professionals and patients led to small improvements in HbA1c and diastolic blood pressure levels. Further study is needed to establish whether a better structured health care delivery, operating in a more supportive environment can enhance these effects.

TI  - The veterans' study to improve the control of hypertension (V-STITCH): design and methodology.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the 60 million Americans with hypertension, only approximately 31% have their blood pressure (BP) under control (<140/90 mm Hg). Despite the damaging impact of hypertension and the availability of evidence-based target values for BP, interventions to improve BP control have had limited success.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A randomized controlled health services intervention trial with a split-plot design is being conducted to improve BP control. This 4-year trial evaluates both a patient and a provider intervention in a primary care setting among diagnosed hypertensive veterans.
AB  - METHODS: In a cluster-randomization, 30 primary care providers in the Durham VAMC Primary Care Clinic were randomly assigned to receive the provider intervention or control. The provider intervention is a patient-specific electronically generated hypertension decision support system (DSS) delivering guideline-based recommendations to the provider at each patient's visit, designed to improve guideline-concordant therapy. For these providers, a sample of their hypertensive patients (n=588) was randomly assigned to receive a telephone-administered patient intervention or usual care. The patient intervention incorporates patients' need assessments and involves tailored behavioral and education modules to promote medication adherence and improve specific health behaviors. All modules are delivered over the telephone bi-monthly for 24 months. In this trial, the primary outcome is the proportion of patients who achieve a BP < or =140/90 mm Hg at each outpatient clinic visit over 24 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite the known risk of poor BP control, a majority of adults still do not have their BP controlled. This study is an important step in testing the effectiveness of a patient and provider intervention to improve BP control among veterans in the primary care setting.

TI  - Results of the Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) trial by geographical region.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine regional differences in the Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) trial.
AB  - DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, international clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: Six hundred and sixty-one clinical centers in 15 countries.
AB  - PATIENTS: Hypertensive volunteers (n = 16,602) with > or =1 additional cardiovascular risk factor, grouped into four regions: USA (n = 8144), Canada (n = 3405), Western Europe (Spain, UK, Italy, Sweden, Germany; n = 2048) or 'other' (Bulgaria, Israel, Mexico, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Brazil; n = 2879); subgroupings included country and state/province within the USA and Canada.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Randomized to COER-verapamil or the investigator's choice of either atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide, titrated and additional drugs added as required.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline characteristics; blood pressure control, medication adherence and lost-to-follow-up at 2 years; and composite primary endpoint (stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death) by regional groupings.
AB  - RESULTS: Regional differences were found at baseline for age, gender, blood pressure, percentage receiving antihypertensive drug therapy, initial choice of atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide, and risk factor profile. Blood pressure control rates increased markedly during follow-up in all regions, but varied significantly by region. Blood pressure control, medication adherence and lost-to-follow-up rates were poorest in the USA. After adjustment for baseline differences, the primary-event rate for each region was significantly lower than for the USA. Although baseline factors, blood pressure control and event rates varied by region, treatment differences did not.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite differences in baseline and follow-up measures across geographical regions, the absence of treatment differences by region suggests that the overall findings of CONVINCE are robust.

TI  - Nurse administered telephone intervention for blood pressure control: a patient-tailored multifactorial intervention.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A randomized controlled trial involving a nurse administered patient-tailored intervention is being conducted to improve blood pressure (BP) control.
AB  - METHODS: Veterans with hypertension from an outpatient primary care clinic completed a baseline assessment and were randomly allocated to either a nurse administered intervention or to usual care. In this ongoing study, intervention patients receive the tailored intervention bi-monthly for 2 years via telephone; the goal of the intervention is to promote adherence with medication and improve health behaviors. Patient factors targeted for intervention include perceived risk of hypertension, memory, literacy, social support, patients' relationship with their health care provider, side effects of therapy, pill refill, missed appointments, and health behaviors.
AB  - RESULTS: The sample randomized to the nurse intervention consisted of 294 veterans with hypertension (average age = 63 years; 41% African-American). A comparable sample of veterans was assigned to usual care (n = 294). We have maintained a 97% retention rate for the first 12 months of the study. The average phone call has lasted 3.7 min ranging from less than 1 to 40 min. At 6-month post-enrollment, individuals receiving the nurse intervention had a greater increase in confidence with following hypertension treatment (P < 0.007) than the usual care group.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The intervention is easily implemented and is designed to enhance adherence with prescribed hypertension regimen. The study includes both general and patient-tailored information based upon need assessment. The study design ensures internal validity as well as the ability to generalize study findings to the clinic settings.

TI  - Nurse-led adherence support in hypertension: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of medication adherence is a common reason for poor control of blood pressure in the community, increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of nurse-led adherence support for people with uncontrolled high blood pressure compared with usual care.
AB  - METHODS: We recruited 245 women and men with uncontrolled hypertension (> or = 150/90 mmHg) from 21 general practices in Bristol, UK. Participants were randomized to receive nurse-led adherence support or usual care alone. Main outcome measures were adherence to medication ('timing compliance') and blood pressure.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean baseline timing compliance (+/- SD) was high in both the intervention (90.8 +/- 15.6%) and the control group (94.5 +/- 7.6%). There was no evidence of an effect of the intervention on timing compliance at follow-up (adjusted difference in means -1.0%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.1 to 3.1). There was also no difference at follow-up between the groups with regard to systolic blood pressure (-2.7 mmHg; 95% CI -7.2 to 1.8) or diastolic blood pressure (0.2 mmHg; 95% CI -1.9 to 2.3). Projected costs for the primary care sector per consultation were 6.60 pound sterling for the intervention compared with 5.08 pound sterling for usual care.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In this study, adherence to blood pressure medication was much higher than previously reported. There was no evidence of an effect of nurse-led adherence support on medication adherence or blood pressure compared with usual care. Nurse-led adherence support was also more expensive from a primary care perspective.

TI  - Effects of nebivolol on artery hypertension--multicentre study Bosnia and Herzegovina.
AB  - Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases; drugs that reduce blood pressure and simultaneously improve or reverse endothelian dysfunction, as nebivolol, may be advantageous in terms of cardiovascular protection. The objective of this study is to show the anti-hypertensive efficacy and safety of nebivolol (5 mg once a day) given to patients with arterial hypertension for 3 months. It should also provide information about drug's influence on laboratory tests--fasting blood glucose and serum cholesterol, triglyceride and creatinine concentrations. Six centers--Tuzla, Sarajevo, Mostar, Bihac, Zenica and Banja Luka participated in this prospective study with follow-up period of 3 months that included 3 visits. The study group consisted of 328 hypertensic patients. Results showed a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate at the end of the study. Fasting blood glucose level and serum cholesterol, triglyceride and creatinine changed significantly during the study, with lower levels of all the tests. Nebivolol seems to be free from some of the problems that generally accompany not only the classical beta- blockers but sometimes also newer classes of antihypertensive drugs. With its high anti-hypertensive efficiency and safety, and presence of statically significant difference in laboratory tests and beneficial effects, absence of adverse interaction with glucose and lipid metabolism, patients treated with Nebivolol may show an optimal adherence to therapy.

TI  - Ethnic, gender, and age-related differences in treatment and control of dyslipidemia in hypertensive patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Demographic differences in management of concomitant lipid disorders among hypertensive patients may contribute to health disparities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Assess demographic differences in lipid control rates and treatment patterns among dyslipidemic hypertensive patients in primary care.
AB  - METHODS: Demographic information, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, and medications were obtained on 72,351 hypertensive patients from 262 primary care providers at 69 sites in the Southeast. Analysis focused on a dyslipidemic hypertensive subset.
AB  - RESULTS: Among 72,351 hypertensives, 38,116 were dyslipidemic. Fifty-two percent of patients did not have a cholesterol measurement documented in the past year. Women and patients <40 years old were less likely to have an annual cholesterol measurement than men and older, same-race counterparts (P < or = .001). Thirty-five percent of all hypertensive dyslipidemic patients had not been prescribed any anti-lipidemic medication, whereas 15% were on a statin and another anti-lipidemic. Women received fewer statin prescriptions than men (47.7% vs 65.1%, P < or = .0001). Fewer African Americans (AA) than Caucasians (C) reached LDL levels of <100 or <130 mg/dL (P < or = .0001). Among C and AA patients, those <40 years old were less likely than older, same-race counterparts to have reached LDL < 100 or <130 mg/dL (p < or = 001). Younger patients had fewer annual cholesterol measurements and were less likely to receive antilipidemic medication and to have LDL controlled than older, same-race counter-parts in each ethnic group (P < or = .0001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Demographic characteristics of hypertensive patients, especially younger age group, are associated with significant differences in diagnostic testing, treatment, and control of hyperlipidemia in primary care. This primary care information can be used to guide education and policy interventions to improve outcomes and reduce disparities.

TI  - Quality of care for hypertension in the United States.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite heavy recent emphasis on blood pressure (BP) control, many patients fail to meet widely accepted goals. While access and adherence to therapy certainly play a role, another potential explanation is poor quality of essential care processes (QC). Yet little is known about the relationship between QC and BP control.
AB  - METHODS: We assessed QC in 12 U.S. communities by reviewing the medical records of a randomly selected group of patients for the two years preceding our study. We included patients with either a diagnosis of hypertension or two visits with BPs of >or=140/90 in their medical records. We used 28 process indicators based on explicit evidence to assess QC. The indicators covered a broad spectrum of care and were developed through a modified Delphi method. We considered patients who received all indicated care to have optimal QC. We defined control of hypertension as BP < 140/90 in the most recent reading.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 1,953 hypertensive patients, only 57% received optimal care and 42% had controlled hypertension. Patients who had received optimal care were more likely to have their BP under control at the end of the study (45% vs. 35%, p = .0006). Patients were more likely to receive optimal care if they were over age 50 (76% vs. 63%, p < .0001), had diabetes (77% vs. 71%, p = .0038), coronary artery disease (87% vs. 69%, p < .0001), or hyperlipidemia (80% vs. 68%, p < .0001), and did not smoke (73% vs. 66%, p = .0005).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Higher QC for hypertensive patients is associated with better BP control. Younger patients without cardiac risk factors are at greatest risk for poor care. Quality measurement systems like the one presented in this study can guide future quality improvement efforts.

TI  - Improving control of hypertension by an integrated approach -- results of the 'Manage it well!' programme.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient non-compliance is a significant contributor to poor blood pressure control. Although measures to improve compliance are known, they are not in routine use.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To apply measures based on current recommendations in an integrated approach in the 'Manage it well!' (MIW) programme, and to determine the improvement in blood pressure control.
AB  - DESIGN AND SETTING: During the prospective open cohort study, 348 primary and 156 secondary care centres enrolled 6941 hypertensive patients and followed them for 6 months.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: An integrated intervention package also applicable to everyday practice was introduced to improve treatment adherence, including education programmes for patients and physicians, tight follow-up with frequent office visits and regular home blood pressure measurements. Treatment was based on either trandolapril or verapamil SR with dose titration, with added-on therapy if necessary.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Rates of control of blood pressure to < 140/90 mmHg.
AB  - RESULTS: Data were evaluated from 5468 patients, 72% known to have hypertension and 26% newly diagnosed [2% not available (n.a.)]. At baseline only 2.9% of treated patients had their hypertension well controlled (< 140/90 mmHg), but during the programme this increased to 40.9% (P < 0.001). The absolute reduction in office blood pressure was also significant (from 168 +/- 19/97 +/- 11 mmHg to 139 +/- 13/83 +/- 7 mmHg; P < 0.001). No differences in blood pressure control were found between trandolapril and verapamil SR regimens. Office blood pressure was greater than home blood pressure at baseline (168 +/- 19/97 +/- 11 mmHg compared with 151 +/- 17/89 +/- 10 mmHg; P < 0.001), but this difference disappeared at 6 months (139 +/- 13/83 +/- 7 mmHg compared with 140 +/- 13/84 +/- 7 mmHg, respectively).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The integrated, patient-focused approach used in the MIW programme significantly increases the success of treatment in a 'real-world' setting.

TI  - Comparison of the Atkins, Ornish, Weight Watchers, and Zone diets for weight loss and heart disease risk reduction: a randomized trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: The scarcity of data addressing the health effects of popular diets is an important public health concern, especially since patients and physicians are interested in using popular diets as individualized eating strategies for disease prevention.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess adherence rates and the effectiveness of 4 popular diets (Atkins, Zone, Weight Watchers, and Ornish) for weight loss and cardiac risk factor reduction.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-center randomized trial at an academic medical center in Boston, Mass, of overweight or obese (body mass index: mean, 35; range, 27-42) adults aged 22 to 72 years with known hypertension, dyslipidemia, or fasting hyperglycemia. Participants were enrolled starting July 18, 2000, and randomized to 4 popular diet groups until January 24, 2002.
AB  - INTERVENTION: A total of 160 participants were randomly assigned to either Atkins (carbohydrate restriction, n=40), Zone (macronutrient balance, n=40), Weight Watchers (calorie restriction, n=40), or Ornish (fat restriction, n=40) diet groups. After 2 months of maximum effort, participants selected their own levels of dietary adherence.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One-year changes in baseline weight and cardiac risk factors, and self-selected dietary adherence rates per self-report.
AB  - RESULTS: Assuming no change from baseline for participants who discontinued the study, mean (SD) weight loss at 1 year was 2.1 (4.8) kg for Atkins (21 [53%] of 40 participants completed, P = .009), 3.2 (6.0) kg for Zone (26 [65%] of 40 completed, P = .002), 3.0 (4.9) kg for Weight Watchers (26 [65%] of 40 completed, P < .001), and 3.3 (7.3) kg for Ornish (20 [50%] of 40 completed, P = .007). Greater effects were observed in study completers. Each diet significantly reduced the low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio by approximately 10% (all P<.05), with no significant effects on blood pressure or glucose at 1 year. Amount of weight loss was associated with self-reported dietary adherence level (r = 0.60; P<.001) but not with diet type (r = 0.07; P = .40). For each diet, decreasing levels of total/HDL cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and insulin were significantly associated with weight loss (mean r = 0.36, 0.37, and 0.39, respectively) with no significant difference between diets (P = .48, P = .57, P = .31, respectively).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Each popular diet modestly reduced body weight and several cardiac risk factors at 1 year. Overall dietary adherence rates were low, although increased adherence was associated with greater weight loss and cardiac risk factor reductions for each diet group.

TI  - Sodium reduction for hypertension prevention in overweight adults: further results from the Trials of Hypertension Prevention Phase II.
AB  - Sodium reduction is efficacious for primary prevention of hypertension, but the feasibility of achieving this effect is unclear. The objective of the paper is detailed analyses of adherence to and effects of the sodium reduction intervention among overweight adults in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention, Phase II. Sodium reduction (comprehensive education and counselling about how to reduce sodium intake) was tested vs no dietary intervention (usual care) for 36-48 months. A total of 956 white and 203 black adults, ages 30-54 years, with diastolic blood pressure 83-89 mmHg, systolic blood pressure (SBP) <140 mmHg, and body weight 110-165% of gender-specific standard weight were included in the study. At 36 months, urinary sodium excretion was 40.4 mmol/24 h (24.4%) lower in sodium reduction compared to usual care participants (P<0.0001), but only 21% of sodium reduction participants achieved the targeted level of sodium excretion below 80 mmol/24 h. Adherence was positively related to attendance at face-to-face contacts. Net decreases in SBP at 6, 18, and 36 months of 2.9 (P<0.001), 2.0 (P<0.001), and 1.3 (P=0.02) mmHg in sodium reduction vs usual care were associated with an overall 18% lower incidence of hypertension (P=0.048); were relatively unchanged by adjustment for ethnicity, gender, age, and baseline blood pressure, BMI, and sodium excretion; and were observed in both black and white men and women. From these beneficial but modest results with highly motivated and extensively counselled individuals, sodium reduction sufficient to favourably influence the population blood pressure distribution will be difficult to achieve without food supply changes.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use in elderly patients hospitalized with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
AB  - PURPOSE: Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are recommended for all patients with systolic heart failure, prior studies suggest that elderly cohorts are less likely to receive such therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine the age dependence of adherence to guideline-based medical care in hospitalized heart failure patients.
AB  - METHODS: We performed a multicenter observational cohort study including 613 patients admitted to participating hospitals with a primary diagnosis of heart failure with ejection fraction < or =40%. This cohort was divided into four age groups (group 1: <60, group 2: 60-69, group 3: 70-79, and group 4: 80 years) and adherence to guideline-based medical care was measured.
AB  - RESULTS: ACE inhibitors were administered to 83% of ideal heart failure patients, and this rate was similar for all age groups. Elderly patients received significantly lower ACE inhibitor dosages compared to their younger counterparts (168, 148, 125 and 117 mg captopril in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, p=0.001). Lower creatinine clearance (p<0.001), prior residence in a long-term care facility (p=0.037), intolerance to ACE inhibitors (p=0.006), lower blood pressure (p=0.005), absence of a history of hypertension (p=0.005), and no prior heart failure hospitalizations within the past year (p=0.001) were found to be independent predictors of low ACE inhibitor dosing.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this heart failure benchmarking project, elderly patients received guideline-based ACE inhibitor therapy at similar rates, but at lower doses, compared to their younger counterparts.Copyright (c) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and CYP2D6 genotypes do not predict metoprolol adverse events or efficacy in hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Beta-Blocker use can be associated with adverse effects that may have an impact on adherence or harm patients. The commonly prescribed beta-blocker metoprolol is metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme, resulting in widely variable drug exposure. We investigated whether metoprolol plasma concentrations, CYP2D6 polymorphisms, or genotype-derived phenotype was associated with adverse effects or efficacy in patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Fifty hypertensive patients received metoprolol by use of a dose-titration algorithm until target blood pressure was reached, intolerable side effects occurred, or maximal daily dose was achieved. CYP2D6 genotype was determined by methods based on polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and included 19 allelic variants. Patients were assigned to standard phenotype groups on the basis of genotype. Patients were also assigned activity scores based on functional activity of the alleles. General and dose-limiting adverse events and blood pressure responses were analyzed in relation to metoprolol steady-state pharmacokinetic profile and CYP2D6 genotype-derived phenotype.
AB  - RESULTS: Poor metabolizers had a significantly longer elimination half-life, higher S-metoprolol area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), and lower oral clearance (P < or = .007 for all parameters). There was a 29.6-fold variability in AUC among extensive metabolizers, which was largely explained by CYP2D6 activity scores (P = .032 for ordered differences in AUC by activity score among extensive metabolizers). Overall general and dose-limiting adverse event rates were 46% and 14%, respectively. General adverse event rates did not differ by AUC quartile (66.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 35.4%-88.7%] and 41.7% [95% CI, 16.5%-71.4%] in the lowest and highest quartiles, respectively; P = .09 among all quartiles). Dose-limiting adverse event rates were also not different by AUC quartile (16.7% [95% CI, 2.9%-49.1%] and 8.3% [95% CI, 0.4%-40.2%] in the lowest and highest quartiles; P = .35 among all quartiles). Furthermore, adverse event rates did not differ by activity scores or between extensive, intermediate, or poor metabolizers. Antihypertensive response rate and blood pressure changes also were not influenced by differences in plasma concentrations or CYP2D6 genotypes.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: As expected, CYP2D6 genotype-phenotype correlates with differences in metoprolol pharmacokinetics. However, there was no association between variable pharmacokinetics or CYP2D6 genotype and beta-blocker-induced adverse effects or efficacy.

TI  - Pharmacist involvement in primary care improves hypertensive patient clinical outcomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The practice of pharmaceutical care in primary care settings in Thailand is currently not generally accepted.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of pharmacist involvement in treatment with hypertensive patients in primary care settings.
AB  - METHODS: The treatment objective was to stabilize the blood pressure (BP) of hypertensive patients in accordance with the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines. Patients were randomly assigned to a pharmacist-involved group (treatment) or a group with no pharmacist involvement (control). Pre- and post-test BPs, tablet counts, lifestyle modifications, and pharmacists' recommendations were recorded. The 6-month study was carried out in Mahasarakham University pharmacy and 2 primary care units. Patients were monitored monthly by reviewing their medications and supported by providing pharmaceutical care and counseling.
AB  - RESULTS: From a total of 235 patients, the treatment group (n = 118) had a significant reduction in both systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP compared with the 117 patients of the control group (p = 0.037, 0.027, respectively). The 158 patients (76 treatment, 82 control) with BPs >or=140/90 mm Hg at the beginning of the study showed significant BP reductions (p = 0.002 SBP, 0.008 DBP). The proportion of 158 patients whose BP became stabilized was higher in the treatment group (p = 0.017). The treatment group showed significantly better adherence (p = 0.014) and exercise control (p = 0.012) at the end of the study. Physicians accepted 42.72% of medication modifications and 5.34% of the suggestions for additional investigations.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive patients who received pharmacist input achieved a significantly greater benefit in BP reduction, BP control, and improvement in adherence rate and lifestyle modification.

TI  - G protein polymorphisms do not predict weight loss and improvement of hypertension in severely obese patients.
AB  - Both the gene encoding the alpha subunit of G stimulatory proteins (GNAS1) and the beta3 subunit gene (GNB3) of G proteins are associated with obesity and/or hypertension. Moreover, the TT/TC825 polymorphism of GNB3 predicts greater weight loss than the CC825 polymorphism in obese patients (mean body mass index, 35 kg/m2) undergoing a structured nonpharmacologic weight loss program. Gastric banding enforces a low-calorie diet by diminishing the need for volitional adherence. It is unknown whether these polymorphisms predict the variable weight loss in patients after bariatric surgery. Three hundred and four severely obese patients (mean +/- SEM age, 42 +/- 1 years; 245 women and 59 men; mean +/- SEM body mass index, 43.9 +/- 0.3 kg/m2) followed prospectively for at least 3 years after surgery were genotyped for the GNB3 C825T, G814A, and GNAS1 T393 polymorphisms. All analyses were performed blinded to the phenotypic characteristics of the study group. Frequencies of polymorphisms were comparable to those previously published. No polymorphism studied predicted 3-year weight loss or was associated with high blood pressure in severely obese patients after gastric banding. Multivariate analysis of potentially confounding factors such as reoperation rate or use of sibutramine or orlistat revealed similar results (P > 0.1). Regardless of the mechanism(s) involved for these discordant findings, GNB3 C825T, G814A, and GNAS1 T393C polymorphisms do not seem to be reliable predictors of long-term weight loss.

TI  - Nurse management for hypertension. A systems approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Standard office-based approaches to controlling hypertension show limited success. Such suboptimal hypertension control reflects in part the absence of both an infrastructure for patient education and frequent, regular blood pressure (BP) monitoring. We tested the efficacy of a physician-directed, nurse-managed, home-based system for hypertension management with standardized algorithms to modulate drug therapy, based on patients' reports of home BP.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized outpatients requiring drug therapy for hypertension according to the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) criteria to receive usual medical care only (UC, n = 76) or usual care plus nurse care management intervention (INT, n = 74) over a 6-month period.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients receiving INT achieved greater reductions in office BP values at 6 months than those receiving UC: 14.2 +/- 18.1 versus 5.7 +/- 18.7 mm Hg systolic (P < .01) and 6.5 +/- 10.0 versus 3.4 +/- 7.9 mm Hg diastolic, respectively (P < .05). At 6 months, we observed one or more changes in drug therapy in 97% of INT patients versus 43% of UC patients, and 70% of INT patients received two or more drugs versus 46% of UC. Average daily adherence to medication, measured by electronic drug event monitors, was superior among INT subjects (mean +/- SD, 80.5% +/- 23.0%) than among UC subjects (69.2 +/- 31.1%; t(113) = 2.199, P = .03). There were no significant adverse drug reactions in either group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Telephone-mediated nurse management can successfully address many of the systems-related and patient-related issues that limit pharmacotherapeutic effectiveness for hypertension.

TI  - A multimethod quality improvement intervention to improve preventive cardiovascular care: a cluster randomized trial.[Summary for patients in Ann Intern Med. 2004 Oct 5;141(7):I53; PMID: 15466764]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research is needed to validate effective and practical strategies for improving the provision of evidence-based medicine in primary care.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a multimethod quality improvement intervention was more effective than a less intensive intervention for improving adherence to 21 quality indicators for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and stroke.
AB  - DESIGN: 2-year randomized, controlled clinical trial with the practice as the unit of randomization.
AB  - SETTING: 20 community-based family or general internal medicine practices in 14 states. All used the same electronic medical record.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 44 physicians, 17 midlevel providers, and approximately 200 staff members; data from the electronic medical records of 87,291 patients.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: All practices received copies of practice guidelines and quarterly performance reports. Intervention practices also hosted quarterly site visits to help them adopt quality improvement approaches and participated in 2 network meetings to share "best practice" approaches.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: The percentage of indicators at or above predefined targets and the percentage of patients who had achieved each clinical indicator.
AB  - RESULTS: Intervention practices improved 22.4 percentage points (from 11.3% to 33.7%) in the percentage of indicators at or above the target; control practices improved 16.4 percentage points (from 6.3% to 22.7%). The 6.0-percentage point absolute difference between the intervention and control group was not statistically significant (P > 0.2). Patients in intervention practices had greater improvements than those in control practices for diagnoses of hypertension (improvement difference, 15.7 percentage points [95% CI, 5.2 to 26.3 percentage points]) and blood pressure control in patients with hypertension (improvement difference, 8.0 percentage points [CI, 0.0 to 16.0 percentage points]).
AB  - LIMITATIONS: The study involved a small number of practices and lacked a pure control group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Primary care practices that use electronic medical records and receive regular performance reports can improve their adherence to clinical practice guidelines for cardiovascular disease and stroke prevention.

TI  - Olive oil, the Mediterranean diet, and arterial blood pressure: the Greek European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study.[Erratum appears in Am J Clin Nutr. 2005 May;81(5):1181]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet has been reported to influence arterial blood pressure, and evidence indicates that the Mediterranean diet reduces cardiovascular mortality.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine whether the Mediterranean diet, as an entity, and olive oil, in particular, reduce arterial blood pressure.
AB  - DESIGN: Arterial blood pressure and several sociodemographic, anthropometric, dietary, physical activity, and clinical variables were recorded at enrollment among participants in the Greek arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Of these participants, 20 343 had never received a diagnosis of hypertension and were included in an analysis in which systolic and diastolic blood pressure were regressed on the indicated possible predictors, including a 10-point score that reflects adherence to the Mediterranean diet and, alternatively, the score's individual components and olive oil.
AB  - RESULTS: The Mediterranean diet score was significantly inversely associated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Intakes of olive oil, vegetables, and fruit were significantly inversely associated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, whereas cereals, meat and meat products, and ethanol intake were positively associated with arterial blood pressure. Mutual adjustment between olive oil and vegetables, which are frequently consumed together, indicated that olive oil has the dominant beneficial effect on arterial blood pressure in this population.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is inversely associated with arterial blood pressure, even though a beneficial component of the Mediterranean diet score-cereal intake-is positively associated with arterial blood pressure. Olive oil intake, per se, is inversely associated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

TI  - Determinants of JNC VI guideline adherence, intensity of drug therapy, and blood pressure control by race and ethnicity.
AB  - The relationship between blood pressure control and racial differences in the processes of hypertension care have not been well examined. We reviewed medical records of 15 768 visits to 12 general internal medicine clinics during July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 to determine whether visits were adherent to the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) by identifying medications selected for hypertension therapy. We compared JNC adherence, blood pressure control, and intensification of therapy by patient characteristics. Using repeated measures logistic regression, we determined the adjusted odds of obtaining blood pressure control when therapy was intensified the visit before, and tested the interaction of intensification of therapy and patient race/ethnicity in predicting blood pressure control. JNC adherence was more frequent among blacks (83.7%) and Hispanics (83%) than whites (78.4%) (P<0.001). Blood pressure was controlled most often among whites (38.7% versus 34.8% for blacks and 33.3% for Hispanics; P<0.001). Blacks (81.5%) and whites (80.9%) were more likely than Hispanics (70.8%) to have therapy intensified (P=0.02). After adjustment for baseline blood pressure, intensifying therapy was associated with higher odds of subsequent blood pressure control (odds ratio, 1.55; P<0.001). There were no significant interactions between race/ethnicity and intensification in predicting control. We found that therapy intensification is associated with subsequent blood pressure control in all racial/ethnic groups and that Hispanics were least likely to have their therapy intensified. Interventions to reduce disparities in cardiovascular outcomes should consider the need to intensify drug therapy more aggressively among all high-risk populations.

TI  - Implementing the new guidelines for hypertension: JNC 7, ADA, WHO-ISH.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The new guidelines issued by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) emphasize that aggressive blood pressure (BP) control is essential to reducing morbidity and mortality. Additionally, guidelines issued by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the World Health Organization-International Society of Hypertension (WHO-ISH) emphasize the critical need for lowering BP levels. Achieving BP goals is a challenge for patients and their physicians, and most patients are not at goal. Poor BP control is even more of a challenge for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease since their goals are even lower. The strategies for lowering BP levels include patient lifestyle changes, adherence to therapy, and regular monitoring of BP levels.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the antihypertension guidelines recommended by WHO-ISH, JNC 7, the ADA, and the Hypertension in African Americans Working Group (HAAW Group) of the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks and evaluate the pharmacist.s collaborative role in the management of hypertension by examining the results of programs designed to include pharmacist counseling.
AB  - METHODS: The relevant literature was evaluated and reviewed. Emphasis was placed on literature that evaluated strategies to improve BP control.
AB  - RESULTS: Results from several programs and studies showed positive effects of pharmacist collaboration. A program that provided pharmacist academic detailing to physicians at 5 Veterans Affairs facilities resulted in significant increases in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy or thiazide diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy. Another study in which hypertensive patients received clinical services from pharmacists showed significant improvement in patients. knowledge of hypertension and its management and in patient adherence, and also showed a significant increase in the number of patients whose BP stayed in the normal range. A 6-month, controlled, single-blind, parallel-group study of 51 hypertensive patients showed significant improvements in BP control, quality of life, and overall patient satisfaction in the study group that received treatment through a primary care team that included pharmacists. Among patients at a Veterans Administration medical center, results suggested that the intervention of a clinical pharmacist improved documentation of drug therapy and estimated patient compliance. A study of the effectiveness of comanagement in 197 hypertensive patients with physician-pharmacist collaboration using an evidence-based, systematic approach showed that a significantly larger number of patients in the study group achieved BP control than in the control group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The expanded role of clinical pharmacists in programs for evaluating, monitoring, and treating patients with hypertension can result in improved adherence to therapy and established guidelines. As members of interdisciplinary health care teams, pharmacists should utilize the JNC 7 guidelines and scientific evidence to consult with physicians about medications, design effective formularies, and collaborate with physicians in evaluating and comanaging patients with hypertension.

TI  - Improving prescribing of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs: a method for identifying and addressing barriers to change.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We describe a simple approach we used to identify barriers and tailor an intervention to improve pharmacological management of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. We also report the results of a post hoc exercise and survey we carried out to evaluate our approach for identifying barriers and tailoring interventions.
AB  - METHODS: We used structured reflection, searched for other relevant trials, surveyed general practitioners and talked with physicians during pilot testing of the intervention. The post hoc exercise was carried out as focus groups of international researchers in the field of quality improvement in health care. The post hoc survey was done by telephone interviews with physicians allocated to the experimental group of a randomised trial of our multifaceted intervention.
AB  - RESULTS: A wide range of barriers was identified and several interventions were suggested through structured reflection. The survey led to some adjustments. Studying other trials and pilot testing did not lead to changes in the design of the intervention. Neither the post hoc focus groups nor the post hoc survey revealed important barriers or interventions that we had not considered or included in our tailored intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A simple approach to identifying barriers to change appears to have been adequate and efficient. However, we do not know for certain what we would have gained by using more comprehensive methods and we do not know whether the resulting intervention would have been more effective if we had used other methods. The effectiveness of our multifaceted intervention is under evaluation in a randomised controlled trial.

TI  - Use of smoking cessation interventions and aspirin for secondary prevention: are there racial disparities?.
AB  - We examined whether racial differences exist in the use of aspirin and smoking cessation interventions for secondary prevention in veterans with coronary artery disease (CAD). We enrolled a total of 1045 African-American and white patients with CAD at 5 Veterans Administration hospitals between 1999 and 2001. Data were obtained by chart review. Among current smokers, African-American and white patients were equally likely to receive smoking cessation interventions (55.8% versus 56.1%; P = .97). Similarly, among ideal candidates for aspirin therapy, there was no difference in overall treatment rates between the 2 groups (74.1% versus 73.4%; P = .85). However, in the subsets of ideal candidates with hypercholesterolemia and previous stroke, African-Americans were less likely than whites to receive aspirin (P < .05). In contrast, African-Americans with hypertension were more likely than whites to receive aspirin (P = .05). Our findings highlight the need for improvement in use of smoking cessation interventions and aspirin among all patients with CAD and indicate an area where future quality improvement efforts may be warranted.

TI  - Evaluating provider adherence in a trial of a guideline-based decision support system for hypertension.
AB  - Measurement of provider adherence to a guideline-based decision support system (DSS) presents a number of important challenges. Establishing a causal relationship between the DSS and change in concordance requires consideration of both the primary intention of the guideline and different ways providers attempt to satisfy the guideline. During our work with a guideline-based decision support system for hypertension, ATHENA DSS, we document a number of subtle deviations from the strict hypertension guideline recommendations that ultimately demonstrate provider adherence. We believe that understanding these complexities is crucial to any valid evaluation of provider adherence. We also describe the development of an advisory evaluation engine that automates the interpretation of clinician adherence with the DSS on multiple levels, facilitating the high volume of complex data analysis that is created in a clinical trial of a guideline-based DSS.

TI  - Lack of chart reminder effectiveness on family medicine resident JNC-VI and NCEP III guideline knowledge and attitudes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The literature demonstrates that medical residents and practicing physicians have an attitudinal-behavioral discordance concerning their positive attitudes towards clinical practice guidelines (CPG), and the implementation of these guidelines into clinical practice patterns.
AB  - METHODS: A pilot study was performed to determine if change in a previously identified CPG compliance factor (accessibility) would produce a significant increase in family medicine resident knowledge and attitude toward the guidelines. The primary study intervention involved placing a summary of the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) and the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (NCEP III) CPGs in all patient (>18 yr.) charts for a period of three months. The JNC VI and NCEP III CPGs were also distributed to each Wayne State family medicine resident, and a copy of each CPG was placed in the preceptor's area of the involved clinics. Identical pre- and post- intervention questionnaires were administered to all residents concerning CPG knowledge and attitude.
AB  - RESULTS: Post-intervention analysis failed to demonstrate a significant difference in CPG knowledge. A statistically significant post-intervention difference was found in only on attitude question. The barriers to CPG compliance were identified as 1) lack of CPG instruction; 2) lack of critical appraisal ability; 3) insufficient time; 4) lack of CPG accessibility; and 5) lack of faculty modeling.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated no significant post intervention changes in CPG knowledge, and only one question that reflected attitude change. Wider resident access to dedicated clinic time, increased faculty modeling, and the implementation of an electronic record/reminder system that uses a team-based approach are compliance factors that should be considered for further investigation. The interpretation of CPG non-compliance will benefit from a causal matrix focused on physician knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Recent findings in resident knowledge-behavior discordance may direct the future investigation of physician CPG non-compliance away from generalized barrier research, and toward the development of information that maximizes the sense of individual practitioner urgency and certainty.

TI  - Strategies for the introduction and implementation of a guideline for the treatment of type 2 diabetics by general practitioners (GPs) of the Lazio region of Italy (IMPLEMEG study): protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial [ISRCTN80116232].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite broad agreement on the necessity to improve quality of diabetic care through implementation of clinical guidelines, in Italy many people with diabetes still lack adequate care in general practice. In addition there is little evidence to support the choice of implementation strategies, especially in the Lazio region (central Italy), where comparative studies among general practitioners (GPs) are uncommon. The primary objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of different strategies for the implementation of an evidence-based guideline for the management of non-complicated type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) among GPs of the Lazio region.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Three-arm cluster-randomised trial (C-RCT). 252 GPs were randomised either to arm 1 (comprising a training module and administration of the guideline), or to arm 2 (administration of guideline without training), or to arm 3 (control arm), continuing current practice. Arm 1 participants attended a two-day course with CME credits. Data collection will be performed using current information systems. Patients' health data was also collected to describe diabetic populations cared for by GP participants. Process outcomes will be measured at the patient level and at the cluster level one year after the intervention. We will assess GPs' adherence to guideline recommendations for diabetes management relative to: 1) pharmacological management of diabetes; 2) pharmacological management of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension and dislypidaemia); 3) measurement of glycosilated haemoglobin as the principal indicator of glycaemic control; 4) micro- and macrovascular complications assessment tests. Outcomes will be expressed as proportions of patients cared for by GPs who will have prescriptions of drugs, requests for tests and for outpatient appointment visits. To estimate the efficiency of resource use associated with the intervention a cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out. The design of the study is based on three Cochrane and one Health Technology Assessment systematic reviews of guideline dissemination and implementation strategies.

TI  - Improving efficacy of diabetes management using treatment algorithms in a mainly Hispanic population.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical outcomes obtained using treatment algorithms versus standard "usual care" to treat patients with type 2 diabetes in a community setting.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An observational group comparison was implemented in three community-based clinics in San Antonio, Texas: 1). a community clinic following treatment algorithms (CC-TA), 2). university clinic following treatment algorithms (UC-TA), and 3). a community clinic following standard "usual care" practices (CC-SC). Three hundred fifty-eight recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients (90% Mexican American, from low-income neighborhoods) who were consecutively identified at the three clinics were recruited. Following medical and laboratory evaluation, participants were started on treatment for hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia and followed for 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Decrements in HbA(1c) at 12 months in the CC-TA and UC-TA were 3.1 and 3.3%, respectively, compared to 1.3% in the CC-SC (P < 0.0001). Corresponding decrements in fasting plasma glucose at 12 months were 94 and 99 mg/dl, respectively, versus 38 mg/dl in CC-SC (P < 0.0001). Reductions in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides at 12 months were greater in both algorithm-managed clinics compared to standard care-managed clinics (P < 0.0001). In algorithm-managed clinics, there were 30% more documented eye exams and 24% more documented foot exams than in standard care-managed patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the treatment algorithms improved metabolic outcomes in type 2 diabetic patients to a greater extent than standard care practices. These results have important clinical implications for the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients.

TI  - Frequent nurse visits decrease white coat effect in stage III hypertension.
AB  - Arterial hypertension is a public health problem and patient adherence to treatment is challenging. This study tested whether frequent nurse visits provide additional benefits to antihypertensive treatment. Every 30 days, a pharmacist visited these patients to deliver antihypertensive drugs and perform a pill count. Nurses visited group A (48 patients) every 15 days and group B (52 patients) every 90 days. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was performed 15 and 180 days after randomization. At randomization, groups A and B had the same clinical systolic (191 +/- 5 v 186 +/- 3 mm Hg) and diastolic BP levels (122 +/- 3 v 117 +/- 4 mm Hg), respectively. After 90 days, BP declined more in group A than in group B (35 +/- 5/19 +/- 3 v 27 +/- 5/9 +/- 3 mm Hg). At 180 days, the difference increased because the reduction persisted in group A but decreased in group B (36 +/- 6/21 +/- 4 v 17 +/- 4/10 +/- 2 mm Hg). The mean ambulatory BP monitoring values were similar in both groups at 15 and 180 days. However, the attenuation of the clinic-daytime BP difference was larger in group A than in group B (systolic, -13 +/- 4 v -3 +/- 4 mm Hg; diastolic -11 +/- 3 v -4 +/- 3 mm Hg). The patients with clinic-daytime differences decreased more in group A (systolic, 16 to 10; diastolic, 20 to 14) than in group B (systolic, 19 and 20; diastolic, 22 and 22). These data indicate that frequent nurse visits significantly attenuate the white coat effect (clinic daytime BP difference).

TI  - Reasons for not intensifying antihypertensive treatment (RIAT): a primary care antihypertensive intervention study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is often poorly controlled, despite its importance and despite the availability of very effective treatments. An under-recognized problem is the failure of consensus guidelines to acknowledge the important difference between efficacy in clinical trials and effectiveness in clinical practice. The present survey was designed to prospectively assess what is the target blood pressure (BP) goal defined by a general practitioner (GP) for an individual patient, and what are the reasons for not modifying an antihypertensive drug regimen, when pre-defined individual BP goals are not achieved.
AB  - DESIGN: Family practice based, open intervention survey.
AB  - SUBJECTS: Participating GPs enrolled 2621 hypertensive patients. At the first visit each physician was required to assess the cardiovascular risk profile of each patient and to define individual BP targets.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Treatment was started with irbesartan alone or in fixed combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Follow-up visits were suggested after 1 month, 2 months and 4 months. Physicians were asked to report BP values under the new treatment regimen and to indicate whether in their opinion pre-defined BP targets set at baseline were achieved or not and whether the antihypertensive regimen was modified or maintained in relation to whether target BP was reached or not.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: To provide reasons for not changing the treatment even though BP goals were missed.
AB  - RESULTS: Average target BP values defined by the physicians at baseline were 138 +/- 8 mmHg for systolic and 84 +/- 5 mmHg for diastolic BP. Among GPs, defined target BP values did not depend on individual risk stratification, but rather depended on baseline BP values. At baseline systolic and diastolic BP averaged 165/97 +/- 17/10 mmHg, while at the last visit achieved BP averaged 140/84 +/- 14/8 mmHg. There were three main reasons for not intensifying antihypertensive treatment when BP targets were not achieved. These reasons were: (1). the assumption that the time after starting the new drug was too short to appreciate its full effect (44% at first, 14% at last follow-up), (2). that there was a clear improvement or the target BP was almost reached (24% at first, 34% at last follow-up) or (3). that self-measurements were considered satisfactorily (10% at the last visit).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Failure of physicians to follow guidelines is apparently dependent on the belief that baseline BP dictates the target, that a clear improvement in BP might be sufficient and that the full drug effect may take up to 4 months or more to be attained.

TI  - Educational outreach in diabetes to encourage practice nurses to use primary care hypertension and hyperlipidaemia guidelines (EDEN): a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of specialist nurse delivered education in primary care to improve control of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia in patients with diabetes.
AB  - DESIGN AND SETTING: Practice-level randomized controlled trial, Salford, England.
AB  - SUBJECTS: From 44 practices, 10 303 subjects presenting in general practice with raised blood pressure (= 140/80 mmHg), raised total cholesterol (= 5.0 mmol/l) or both.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Practices were randomized to receive either the intervention for hyperlipidaemia or for hypertension; practices acted as control for the intervention not received. Specialist nurses arranged a schedule of visits with general practitioners and general practice nurses, reminding them of diabetes protocols and clinical targets. They provided educational materials and protocols used in secondary care for nurse and doctor interventions including stepping up pharmacotherapy when necessary. Practices received a list of patients in their practice who were poorly controlled at their last annual review; new and recalled patients were targeted.
AB  - OUTCOME MEASURES: At subsequent annual review, blood pressure and total cholesterol values were obtained from the Salford electronic diabetes register for patients from participating practices.
AB  - RESULTS: Overall, specialist nurse-led educational outreach to primary care was associated with no improvement in patients achieving target after 1 year-odds ratio (OR): 1.03 (95% CI 0.95-1.11; P = 0.52). Similar results were achieved with hyperlipidaemia OR: 1.04 (95% CI 0.88-1.23; P = 0.62) and hypertension OR: 1.01 (95% CI 0.80-1.27; P = 0.93).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the use of specialist nurses to perform educational outreach to improve target adherence to patients with diabetes in primary care is not effective.

TI  - Treating to hypertension targets.
AB  - Control of blood pressure levels in hypertensive patients often fails to meet the targets suggested by the British Hypertension Society (BHS) guidelines. The optimal treatment target for non-diabetic patients is < or = 140/85 mm Hg. Data from the health survey for England show that in 1998 only 8% of men and 11% of women had blood pressure controlled to < 140/90 mm Hg. The Anglo-Scandinavian cardiac outcomes trial (ASCOT) data show that 87% of non-diabetic patients in the St Mary's Centre are currently treated to below 140/90 mm Hg. These differences can be explained by strict protocol adherence, a focus on cardiovascular disease, longer consultation times and punctual appointments, reinforcement of non-pharmacological advice, and blood pressure readings taken in line with BHS guidelines. Some of these points might be translated into the more challenging setting of primary care.

TI  - Ciclosporin in psoriasis clinical practice: an international consensus statement. [Review] [63 refs]
AB  - The main recommendations for the use of ciclosporin in the management of psoriasis are: (i) intermittent short courses (average of 12 weeks duration) of ciclosporin are preferable; (ii) ciclosporin should be given in the dose range 2.5-5.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1) (doses greater than 5.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1) should only be given in exceptional circumstances); (iii) treatment regimens should be tailored to the needs of each patient; (iv) selection of patients should take into account psychosocial disability, as well as clinical extent of disease and failure of previous treatment; (v) each patient's renal function (as measured by serum creatinine) should be thoroughly assessed before and during treatment; (vi) each patient's blood pressure should be carefully monitored before and during treatment; (vii) adherence to treatment guidelines substantially reduces the risk of adverse events; (viii) long-term continuous ciclosporin therapy may be appropriate in a subgroup of patients; however, duration of treatment should be kept below 2 years whenever possible; and (ix) when long-term continuous ciclosporin therapy is necessary, annual evaluation of glomerular filtration rate may be useful to accurately monitor renal function.

TI  - Validation of a general measure of treatment satisfaction, the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), using a national panel study of chronic disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to develop and psychometrically evaluate a general measure of patients' satisfaction with medication, the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM).
AB  - METHODS: The content and format of 55 initial questions were based on a formal conceptual framework, an extensive literature review, and the input from three patient focus groups. Patient interviews were used to select the most relevant questions for further evaluation (n = 31). The psychometric performance of items and resulting TSQM scales were examined using eight diverse patient groups (arthritis, asthma, major depression, type I diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, migraine, and psoriasis) recruited from a national longitudinal panel study of chronic illness (n = 567). Participants were then randomized to complete the test items using one of two alternate scaling methods (Visual Analogue vs. Likert-type).
AB  - RESULTS: A factor analysis (principal component extraction with varimax rotation) of specific items revealed three factors (Eigenvalues > 1.7) explaining 75.6% of the total variance; namely Side effects (4 items, 28.4%, Cronbach's Alpha =.87), Effectiveness (3 items, 24.1%, Cronbach's Alpha =.85), and Convenience (3 items, 23.1%, Cronbach's Alpha =.87). A second factor analysis of more generally worded items yielded a Global Satisfaction scale (3 items, Eigenvalue = 2.3, 79.1%, Cronbach's Alpha =.85). The final four scales possessed good psychometric properties, with the Likert-type scaling method performing better than the VAS approach. Significant differences were found on the TSQM by the route of medication administration (oral, injectable, topical, inhalable), level of illness severity, and length of time on medication. Regression analyses using the TSQM scales accounted for 40-60% of variation in patients' ratings of their likelihood to persist with their current medication.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The TSQM is a psychometrically sound and valid measure of the major dimensions of patients' satisfaction with medication. Preliminary evidence suggests that the TSQM may also be a good predictor of patients' medication adherence across different types of medication and patient populations.

TI  - Effects of exercise, diet and weight loss on high blood pressure. [Review] [112 refs]
AB  - High blood pressure (BP) is a major health problem in the US, affecting more than 50 million people. Although high BP is among the most common reasons for outpatient visits, BP control is often inadequate. It is well established that BP can be lowered pharmacologically in hypertensive individuals; however, anti-hypertensive medications are not effective for everyone, and may be costly and result in adverse effects that impair quality of life and reduce adherence. Moreover, abnormalities associated with high BP, such as insulin resistance and hyperlipidaemia, may persist or may even be exacerbated by some anti-hypertensive medications. Consequently, there has been a great deal of interest in the development and application of behavioural interventions in the management of high BP. The main behavioural interventions that are recommended to reduce BP are exercise and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Weight loss is also recommended for BP reduction in overweight individuals. Exercise alone is associated with reductions of approximately 3.5 and 2.0mm Hg in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively. Patients fed a DASH diet (a diet high in low-fat dairy products and fibre, including fruits and vegetables) had reductions in SBP and DBP of 5.5 and 3.0mm Hg, respectively, compared with those consuming a standard US diet. Reductions of approximately 8.5mm Hg SBP and 6.5mm Hg DBP accompany weight loss of 8 kg. In overweight hypertensive patients, a combined exercise and weight-loss intervention has been shown to decrease SBP and DBP by 12.5 and 7.9 mm Hg, respectively. There is evidence to suggest that these decreases in BP are associated with improvements in left ventricular structure and function, and peripheral vascular health. Both exercise training and weight loss have been shown to decrease left ventricular mass and wall thickness, reduce arterial stiffness and improve endothelial function. These data support the role of behavioural interventions in the treatment of patients with elevations in BP. [References: 112]

TI  - How can we improve adherence to blood pressure-lowering medication in ambulatory care? Systematic review of randomized controlled trials. [Review] [55 refs]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of adherence to blood pressure-lowering medication is a major reason for poor control of hypertension worldwide. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of interventions to increase adherence to blood pressure-lowering medication.
AB  - METHODS: We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and searched for all-language publications in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL in April 2002.
AB  - RESULTS: We included 38 studies testing 58 different interventions and containing data on 15 519 patients. The studies were conducted in 9 countries between 1975 and 2000. The duration of follow-up ranged from 2 to 60 months. Because of heterogeneity between studies in terms of interventions and the methods used to measure adherence, we did not pool the results. Simplifying dosing regimens increased adherence in 7 of 9 studies, with a relative increase in adherence of 8% to 19.6%. Motivational strategies were partly successful in 10 of 24 studies with generally small increases in adherence up to a maximum of 23%. Complex interventions comparing more than 1 technique increased adherence in 8 of 18 studies, ranging from 5% to a maximum of 41%. Patient education alone seemed largely unsuccessful.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure-lowering medication and should be tried as a first-line strategy, although there is so far less evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction. Some motivational strategies and complex interventions appear promising, but we need more evidence on their effect through carefully designed randomized controlled trials. [References: 55]

TI  - Rationale and design of the Rockford CHIP, a community-based coronary risk reduction program: results of a pilot phase.
AB  - PURPOSE: While residential lifestyle intervention programs have demonstrated coronary risk reduction through education, diet, and exercise, this pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a community-based lifestyle intervention program that is both affordable and effective in facilitating better lifestyle choices and health habits and thus effecting indicators of better clinical outcomes.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 40-h educational curriculum, delivered over a 30-day period with clinical and nutritional assessments before and after, was offered through the SwedishAmerican Center for Complementary Medicine to the general public. The participants were instructed to exercise 30 min/day and to embrace a more optimal diet (ad libitum) of largely unrefined plant foods high in complex carbohydrates and fiber, yet quite low in fat (<15%), animal protein, sugar, and salt, and virtually free of cholesterol.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 250 enrollees, 242 "graduated" (78 men and 164 women; almost all Caucasian; mean age 54 +/- 12 years). They had coronary artery disease (CAD) (12%), diabetes (16%), hypertension (55%), most were overweight (88%), and the majority (79%) had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels >or=100 mg%. At 4 weeks, stratified analyses of total cholesterol (TC), LDL, triglycerides (TG), blood glucose, blood pressure, and weight showed that those at highest risk also had the greatest improvements. Depending on baseline levels, TC means dropped 10-23% in men and 6-13% in women. At the same time, LDL means declined 5-30% in men and 6-14% in women. In TG, the biggest drop (48%) was found in men who at baseline were in the highest risk category (in women, the biggest TG drop was 32%).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Community-based intervention strategies can be successfully and affordably utilized to lower coronary risk factor levels in a self-selected, free-living population. The true test, however, will be to what extent social infrastructures can be modified and alumni activities sustained to facilitate long-term adherence and sustained benefits.

TI  - The Accoson Greenlight 300, the first non-automated mercury-free blood pressure measurement device to pass the International Protocol for blood pressure measuring devices in adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate blood pressure measurement is critical to successful care of the hypertensive patient. The mercury manometer is rapidly being removed from clinical practice due to concerns about environmental contamination. The Accoson Greenlight 300 device is the first non-automated mercury-free device for auscultatory blood pressure measurement to pass the International Protocol for validation of blood pressure measuring devices in adults.
AB  - METHODS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled to obtain the 33 patients required to fill the three systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranges (low 90-129 mmHg, medium 130-160 mmHg, high 161-180 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranges (low 40-79 mmHg, medium 80-100 mmHg, high 101-130 mmHg). Nine sequential blood pressure measurements by two observers with the mercury manometer and the supervisor with the Greenlight 300 were taken. The first two observer blood pressures were used to classify the SBP and DBP range. The readings were then analyzed in two phases to determine whether the device passed the International Protocol.
AB  - RESULTS: The device passed Phase 1 using 15 subjects. In Phase 2.1 (n=33) for the 99 readings of SBP, 84 of 99 were within 5 mmHg, 95 of 99 were within 10 mmHg, and 98 of 99 were within 15 mmHg. For the 99 readings of DBP, 74 of 99 were within 5 mmHg, 90 of 99 were within 10 mmHg, and 96 of 99 were within 15 mmHg. In Phase 2.2 (n=33) for SBP, 33 of 33 had 2 of 3 SBP within 5 mmHg and none had all three readings >or=5 mmHg. For DBP, 27 of 33 had 2 of 3 of their DBP within 5 mmHg and only three had all three readings > or =5 mmHg.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Accoson Greenlight 300 is the first electronic non-automated blood pressure measurement device to pass the International Protocol.

TI  - Effects of infusion of adenosine triphosphate-magnesium chloride on cardiopulmonary and clinicopathologic variables, cytokine activity, and endothelin concentration in horses administered a low dose of endotoxin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate systemic effects of i.v. infusion of ATP-MgCl2 subsequent to infusion of a low dose of endotoxin in horses.
AB  - ANIMALS: 12 adult horses.
AB  - PROCEDURE: Horses were administered endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution i.v., during a 30-minute period. Immediately thereafter, horses in each group were infused i.v. with ATP-MgCl2 or saline solution. Two weeks later, horses were administered the opposite solution (LPS or saline solution), but it was followed by the same infusion as 2 weeks previously (ie, ATP-MgCl2 or saline solution). Cardiopulmonary and clinicopathologic variables, cytokine activity, and endothelin (ET) concentrations were recorded.
AB  - RESULTS: IV infusion of ATP-MgCl2 after administration of a low dose of endotoxin failed to attenuate the cardiopulmonary, clinicopathologic, and cytokine alterations that develop secondary to endotoxin exposure. The combination of LPS and ATP-MgCl2 potentiated pulmonary hypertension, leukopenia, and neutropenia when compared with the combination of LPS and saline solution. The combination of LPS and ATP-MgCl2 resulted in thrombocytopenia. Endothelin concentration was increased in jugular venous and pulmonary arterial plasma in horses receiving LPS and ATP-MgCl2. Similar increases were not observed with LPS and saline solution.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Administration of ATP-MgCl2 did not protect horses from systemic effects of experimentally induced endotoxemia. Furthermore, the use of ATP-MgCl2 during endotoxemia may worsen the cardiopulmonary and clinicopathologic status of affected horses. Because ATP and other adenine nucleotides are released from cells during shock, their potential role in the development of hemodynamic derangements, leukocyte adherence, and coagulopathies during endotoxemic episodes warrants further investigation.

TI  - Randomised equivalence trial comparing three month and six month follow up of patients with hypertension by family practitioners.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare blood pressure control, satisfaction, and adherence to drug treatment in patients with treated hypertension followed up by their family physicians either every three months or every six months for three years.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomised equivalence clinical trial. Settings 50 family practices in south eastern Ontario, Canada.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 609 patients aged 30-74 years with essential hypertension receiving drug treatment whose hypertension had been controlled for at least three months before entry into the study.
AB  - RESULTS: 302 patients were randomly assigned to follow up every three months and 307 to follow up every six months. Baseline variables in the two groups were similar. As expected, patients in the six month group had significantly fewer visits, but patients in both groups visited their doctor more frequently than their assigned interval. Mean blood pressure was similar in the groups, as was control of hypertension. Patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment were similar in the groups. About 20% of patients in each group had blood pressures that were out of control during the study.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Follow up of patients with treated essential hypertension every six months is equivalent to follow up every three months. Patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment are the same for these follow up intervals. As about 20% of patients' hypertension was out of control at any time during the study in both groups, the frequency of follow up may not the most important factor in the control of patients' hypertension by family practitioners.

TI  - Antihypertensive utility of perindopril in a large, general practice-based clinical trial.
AB  - The authors evaluated, in a community-based open-label trial, the effectiveness and safety of perindopril in 13,220 US hypertensive patients and studied how physicians adhere to hypertension treatment guidelines. Patients received perindopril 4 mg q.d. for 6 weeks. Based on physicians perception of blood pressure response, the patient was either maintained on 4 mg or the dose was increased to 8 mg for an additional 6 weeks. From baseline to week 12, the mean sitting blood pressure significantly declined from 156.9/94.5 mm Hg to 139.2/84.0 mm Hg. Further dose titration resulted in a clinically significant reduction in blood pressure in all patients with inadequate response on 4 mg at week 6. Blood pressure control (<140/<90 mm Hg) was achieved at 12 weeks in 48.8% patients. The subpopulation analyses demonstrated that perindopril monotherapy was effective in both men and women, in patients of all ethnicities, and in patients <65 and > or =65 years of age. Perindopril was safe and well tolerated in all hypertensive subgroups including high-risk patients. Physicians were more attuned to controlling diastolic than systolic blood pressure, and their adherence to the treatment guidelines was found to be not optimal.

TI  - Can prescription refill feedback to physicians improve patient adherence?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although adherence to long-term drug therapy is an important issue, the means to facilitate its assessment and improvement in clinical practice remain a challenge.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of prescription refill feedback and adherence education provided to primary care physicians.
AB  - METHODS: We provided 83 resident and attending physicians at a university-based general internal medicine practice with refill adherence reports on each of 340 diabetic patients. An educational session on adherence assessment and improvement techniques was held, and all physicians received a written outline on this topic. Physician attitude toward the intervention and 6-month change in refill adherence (doses filled/doses prescribed) of their patient panels were assessed. A nonrandomized comparison group of patients receiving hypertension medications for whom the physicians did not receive feedback was also evaluated.
AB  - RESULTS: The overall improvement in mean refill adherence was not significant (83.9% vs 86.0%, P=0.18). The educational session was attended by 53% of the physicians. The patient refill adherence of physicians attending the educational session improved by 5.0% (P<0.0009) with no significant change among patients of physicians not attending the session. There was no adherence change among patients for whom physicians did not receive refill feedback data, regardless of educational session attendance.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients of physicians that received refill feedback and attended an educational session improved their refill adherence. After replication of these results in a randomized trial, broad implementation of this approach could have substantial impact from a public health perspective, given the ubiquity of prescription claims data.

TI  - Results of cardiac rehabilitation in patients with diabetes mellitus.
AB  - To study the prevalence, risk profile, and outcomes of diabetics in cardiac rehabilitation, data on 952 consecutively enrolled patients were evaluated. Diabetics on entry had poor glycemic control, and compared with nondiabetics, had a greater adverse risk profile (body mass index, waist circumference, hypertension, triglycerides, peripheral vascular disease, and lower fitness levels), and a lower program adherence rate. Although exercise capacity significantly improved, it is clear from the outcomes reported in this study that more effective interventions in weight management, lipid lowering, and glycemic control are needed. This study emphasizes the need to identify diabetic patients in contemporary cardiac rehabilitation programs and target them for an aggressive program of risk factor management, including exercise training.

TI  - Aspirin use post-acute coronary syndromes: intolerance, bleeding and discontinuation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: While aspirin's secondary prevention benefit is clear, prior reports indicate that 19-83% of eligible patients may not use aspirin chronically.
AB  - METHODS: We investigated intolerance and bleeding while on aspirin and aspirin discontinuation using 5337 post-acute coronary syndrome patients considered appropriate for chronic antiplatelet therapy who were randomly assigned to aspirin in SYMPHONY and 2nd SYMPHONY and followed for 94 (64,157) days. Multivariable logistic regression models tested associations between baseline characteristics and aspirin discontinuation and bleeding.
AB  - RESULTS: Nearly 18% of patients discontinued study aspirin; 48% subsequently used open-label aspirin and 5% other antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. Black race, recurrent ischemia, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lighter weight, shorter time to treatment and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, diuretics, and digitalis were independently associated with early discontinuation. Early discontinuation was less likely in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. Although major or minor bleeding was common (12.6%), only 1.0% of aspirin-treated patients were reported to discontinue due to bleeding. Gastrointestinal (10.5%) and puncture site (7.6%) were the most common bleeding locations. Bleeding risk was associated with lower estimated creatinine clearance, shorter time to treatment, smoking, Killip class >II, higher systolic blood pressure, and use of aspirin or heparin prior to starting study aspirin.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Despite early initiation and close follow-up, more than 9% of aspirin-treated patients discontinued therapy early and remained off treatment. Addressing the factors associated with both bleeding and discontinuation during chronic therapy is necessary to improve adherence to this inexpensive, life-saving therapy.

TI  - Adherence to antihypertensive therapy with fixed-dose amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl versus comparable component-based therapy.
AB  - Adhering to medication regimens has the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes for persons with high blood pressure. A patient-related factor likely to affect adherence to treatment is the convenience of the prescribed drug regimen. The authors hypothesized that medication adherence would be superior and cost benefits would accrue in subjects who receive a once-daily, single-capsule, fixed-dose combination product for blood pressure control, compared with subjects who receive a similar regimen of separate components. A managed care organization that provides benefits for members enrolled in various health plans provided the data for this retrospective analysis. The database was used to assess medication adherence patterns for two groups of hypertensive subjects. Group 1 included subjects who had been prescribed the single-capsule, fixed-dose combination of amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl. Group 2 comprised subjects who had been prescribed a regimen including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker as separate drugs. Adherence was measured by the medication possession ratio, and medical resource utilization by the two groups was assessed during the study period. Group 1 (n=2754) and Group 2 (n=2978) were balanced with regard to age (mean, 53 years; range, 18-64 years) and sex (men, 50%; women, 50%). The overall medication possession ratio for Group 1 was significantly higher than that for Group 2 (80.8% vs. 73.8%; p<0.001). The average annual cost of cardiovascular-related care per subject was significantly lower in Group 1 compared with Group 2 (p<0.001). Subjects receiving the once-daily, single-capsule, fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril HCl demonstrated significantly better medication adherence and required fewer medical resources than did subjects receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker as separate components.

TI  - The influence of patient's consciousness regarding high blood pressure and patient's attitude in face of disease controlling medicine intake.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between blood pressure control and the following: the Morisky-Green test, the patient's consciousness regarding high blood pressure, the patient's attitude in face of medicine intake, the patient's attendance at medical consultations, and the subjective physician's judgment.
AB  - METHODS: We studied 130 hypertensive patients with the following characteristics: 73% females, 60 +/- 11 years, 58% married, 70% white, 45% retired, 45% with incomplete elementary schooling, 64% had a familial income of 1 to 3 minimum wages, body mass index of 30 +/- 7 kg/m , consciousness regarding the disease for a mean period of 11 +/- 9.5 years, and mean treatment duration of 8 +/- 7 years.
AB  - RESULTS: Only 35% of the hypertensive individuals had blood pressure under control and a longer duration of treatment (10 +/- 7 vs 7 +/- 6.5 years; P<0.05). The retiree predominated. The result of the Morisky-Green test did not relate to blood pressure control. In evaluating the attitude in face of medicine intake, the controlled patients achieved significantly higher scores than did the noncontrolled patients (8 +/- 1.9 vs 7 +/- 2, P<0.05). The hypertensive patients had higher levels of consciousness regarding their disease and its treatment, and most (70%) patients attended 3 or 4 medical consultations, which did not influence blood pressure control. The physicians attributed significantly higher scores regarding adherence to treatment to controlled patients (6 +/- 0.8 vs 5 +/- 1.2; P<0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Consciousness regarding the disease, the Morisky-Green test, and attendance to medical consultations did not influence blood pressure control.

TI  - Leaving the practice: effects of primary care physician departure on patient care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent changes in the organization of health care services, coupled with rising rates of primary care physician (PCP) turnover, pose threats to the maintenance of a continuous patient-physician relationship. Little is known, however, about how PCP departure may affect patients' quality of health care.
AB  - METHODS: Participants were adult patients whose PCPs left a large, multispecialty group practice from July 1, 1994, to June 30, 1996 (n = 3931), and adult patients of a set of matched PCPs who remained in the practice at least 2 years beyond the index PCPs departure dates (n = 8009). We compared the following measures of quality of care: adherence to recommended screening guidelines, adequacy of blood pressure and glycemic control in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus, and use of urgent care and emergency department services.
AB  - RESULTS: Among the women who received a mammogram in the 2-year baseline period, a higher proportion of those whose PCP departed did not continue to receive mammograms, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (8.4% vs 5.1%; P =.08). For patients who had screening Papanicolaou smears or fecal occult blood testing during the baseline period, there was no significant difference between study and control groups in the likelihood that patients discontinued screening during the follow-up period (10.9% vs 10.7%; P =.93 and 28.8% vs 25.3%; P =.93, respectively). Similarly, diabetic patients of departed PCPs did not have higher risk of worsening glycemic control (31.7% vs 28.9%; P =.46); and hypertensive patients of departed PCPs actually had lower risks of worsening blood pressure control (16.5% vs 22.5%; P =.02). There was no difference in use of urgent care or emergency department services between patient groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this multispecialty group practice, patients of departed PCPs experienced little or no decrease in quality of care measures for routine screening, management of chronic disease, and use of urgent care and emergency department services.

TI  - Manipulation of patient-provider interaction: discussing illness representations or action plans concerning adherence.
AB  - According to Leventhal's Self-Regulatory Model of Illness, patients have ideas and action plans related to the management of their disease. The aim of this study is to examine whether ideas and action plans relating to hypertension change as a result of general practitioner's (GP's) discussing them during consultation, and whether these changed ideas and actions plans affect adherence. The study employed an experimental design, highlighting three conditions: (0) care-as-usual consultation; (1) discussing patient's ideas about their disorder; and (2) discussing patient's action plans. Ten GP-trainees performed care-as-usual consultations, were subsequently assigned to a training in either Condition 1 or 2, and performed the trained conversations. Hundred and eight patients with hypertension were consecutively assigned to the conditions, and completed questionnaires a week before, immediately after the consultation, and 1 month later. The training resulted in two new, feasible and different types of conversations that managed to affect some of the patient's ideas and action plans. It is concluded that the study provided GPs with a tool to discuss illness representations and actions plan of patients with hypertension. Implications for the management of hypertension adherence in primary care are discussed.

TI  - Measuring adherence in a hypertension clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-adherence in hypertension is a global problem and promoting adherence is necessary to decrease cardiovascular mortality.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this paper is to examine the measurement of adherence to medication taking in hypertensive patients. Adherence was evaluated primarily by means of MEMS (Medication Event Monitoring System, Aprex Corporation, Fremont, California) an electronic system that records the date and time of opening of the study medication container. Additional measurements such as change in urinary potassium level, capsule count, client self report and physician estimate of adherence were recorded.
AB  - METHODS: A randomised clinical trial was used to assign patients to receive the study medication (potassium) or placebo. Descriptive statistics were used to answer the research questions. Frequency and percentage of responses to different measures of adherence were carried out as well as correlation between the measures.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred and seven subjects between the ages of 26 and 80 participated in the clinical trial. The results showed that adherence measures varied with lowest adherence from two items of self-report related to forgetfulness (46 and 55%) and stringent electronic monitoring with the MEMS (58%) to percentages in the 80-90 range for other self-report items and the general adherence scale. Electronic monitoring correlated best with capsule count at visit 5. Implications for health care providers are discussed.

TI  - African Americans' beliefs and attitudes regarding hypertension and its treatment: a qualitative study.
AB  - Since low adherence rates contribute to morbidity and mortality among hypertensive African Americans, health beliefs known to influence nonadherence must be explored. Hypertensive African Americans were recruited from an urban, public hospital and divided into two categories: adherent, well-controlled versus nonadherent, poorly controlled participants. Separate focus group sessions were held for each category. Participants proved similar with respect to sociodemographic variables but varied in the duration of hypertension. Some beliefs were mentioned more often among nonadherent participants than among adherent participants when describing medical treatments and physicians' encounters. Some participants perceived medication to be harmful and noneffective, and some expressed distrust of pharmaceutical companies and physicians, believing them to use patients for experimentation to test medications. Their descriptions of dialogues with physicians suggested authoritarian and ethnicity-inappropriate communication patterns. To reduce the nonadherence rate among African Americans, it may be necessary to integrate health beliefs into educational interventions and physician-patient communication.

TI  - Computer telephony: automated calls for medical care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The computer telephony system (CTS) combines computer and telephone to automate the collection, processing and dissemination of information. Many innovative applications of the CTS have emerged. In this article we summarize the evidence for CTS-based medical interventions based on randomized controlled trials.
AB  - METHODS: We searched for trials in MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and bibliographies of retrieved articles, review articles and textbooks. We excluded non-English articles and those pertaining to psychology, addiction, psychiatry, research and education.
AB  - RESULTS: In health care delivery, 3 of 4 trials of CTS-based interventions improved clinic show rates. In preventive health care, 4 of 5 showed higher childhood immunization rates. For nutrition, 2 small trials showed no clear benefit in cholesterol lowering or in weight reduction, but 1 trial showed a benefit in fibre intake. For increasing physical activity, 1 smaller trial showed no benefit but a larger one did. For medical management of chronic conditions, 1 trial showed improved hemoglobin A(1c) levels and 1 trial showed better processes of care in diabetes. In hypertension management, 1 trial found better adherence to medication regimens and control of blood pressure. In outpatient oncology care, 1 trial showed better supportive care. For support of caregivers for dementia patients, 1 trial showed no benefit. One small trial showed better adherence to medication in seniors.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The CTS has diverse applications in medical care; however, the evidence for these is limited. Despite being impersonal, the reliability and availability of the CTS make it attractive for reminders and follow-up. More research is needed to determine the role of the CTS in medical care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify markers for loss of control of hypertension.
AB  - DESIGN: Questionnaire administered to patients who had been monitored for 18 months and had had their blood pressure (BP) measured many times.
AB  - SETTING: Fifty family practices in southeastern Ontario.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred eighty-five adults with essential hypertension that was initially stable and controlled by medication.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in BP (from baseline to mean of three measurements over 18 months) and proportion of patients with BP exceeding threshold values at most follow-up visits.
AB  - RESULTS: Higher income was associated with an increase in diastolic BP; poor adherence to medication regimens and higher life stress were associated with increases in systolic BP Stress also led to a twofold increase in risk of exceeding BP thresholds. Other factors under study were not related to loss of control.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Adherence to medication regimens, higher income, and life stress were the only factors associated with elevated BP or loss of control in previously controlled hypertension.

TI  - Aggressive blood pressure control in general practice (ABC-GP) study: can the new targets be reached?.
AB  - Based on outcome trials, guidelines for hypertension management recommend lower blood pressure (BP) goals using an individualized treatment strategy (IND) and referral to a specialist of patients uncontrolled after 6 months of treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of General Practitioners (GPs) in reaching the recommended BP goals using the IND, or a stepwise treatment strategy (STEP) as used in the outcome trials. Trained GPs were randomized to reach the BP goals within 6 months using the IND or a STEP strategy in untreated or treated uncontrolled hypertensives. In all, 24 GPs recruited 528 patients of whom 443 were analysed (mean age 65+/-9 years, 42% men, 70% treated, STEP/IND 12/12 GPs, 231/211 patients). After 6 months, 83% of the patients had reached the diastolic BP goal, whereas only 51% the systolic (P<0.0001 for difference). Factors associated with uncontrolled systolic BP were diabetes, age >60 years and triple antihypertensive therapy at baseline. A faster BP reduction was achieved during the first 3 months using the STEP strategy, but at the cost of using more drugs (combination therapy in 68/59% for STEP/IND, P=0.06). At 6 months similar rates of control were achieved with the two strategies. In conclusion, in primary care the diastolic BP goal can be reached within 6 months in the majority of patients, whereas systolic BP remains uncontrolled in 50% of the cases. The IND should be the recommended treatment strategy, but further investigation is required on the reasons for treatment failure and the optimal strategy for its improvement.

TI  - Dietary quality assurance processes of the DASH-Sodium controlled diet study.
AB  - A thorough quality assurance (QA) program upholds the integrity of nutrition research studies by yielding reliable data and results. Continually evaluating the implementation of a procedure against a goal and making adjustments when needed enhance the quality of a study's conduct and outcomes. Controlled diet studies require QA processes at various steps beginning with the screening of study participants, through diet preparation and delivery to data collection. Staff training and observations with monitoring activities, are important so tasks are completed according to protocol. When several clinical sites participate as partners in a controlled diet study, uniform procedures must be followed and a formal standardized QA program will assist. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium study employed such a program, described in this article, that included training staff, observing procedures, monitoring data for completeness and accuracy, evaluating processes, giving feedback, and documenting that tasks were done according to protocol. Furthermore, QA processes were used in the areas of participant screening, orientation, diet adherence, food procurement and preparation, and exit interviews. Other researchers may implement similar activities to ensure quality in their nutrition research programs.

TI  - Quality of care for patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus--a long-term comparison of two quality improvement programmes in the Netherlands.
AB  - AIM: To compare two intervention programmes, aimed at improving the quality of care provided for patients with Type 2 diabetes in the longer term.
AB  - METHODS: A retrospective comparison of data derived from two non-randomized trials with 3.5 years of follow-up. In the first intervention group 401 patients were included, 413 in the second intervention group and 105 in the reference group. The first programme focused on improving the skills and knowledge of general practitioners (GPs) with regard to Type 2 diabetes, and supported them in making organizational changes in their practice (GP care only). Centralized shared diabetes care was implemented in the second programme in which the GPs received therapy advice according to a protocol for each individual patient. The patients were also encouraged in self-management, and received structured diabetes education (Diabetes Service). The main patient outcomes were HbA1c, blood pressure and serum lipid levels. Multilevel analysis was applied to adjust for dependency between repeated observations within one patient and for clustering of patients within general practices.
AB  - RESULTS: The HbA1c levels of patients of GPs who were supported by the Diabetes Service improved significantly more than the HbA1c levels of patients receiving GP care only (-0.28% [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.45; -0.11]). In contrast, the systolic blood pressure of patients receiving GP care only decreased more than that of patients of GPs supported by the Diabetes Service [4.14 mmHg (95% CI 1.77, 6.51)].
AB  - CONCLUSION: A Diabetes Service, providing GPs with individual therapy advice and patient education, resulted in better glycaemic control over 3.5 years than an intervention aimed at improving the skills of GPs in combination with organizational changes in the general practice.

TI  - Pharmacist intervention program for control of hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical care programs have been shown to improve outcomes in hypertension. However, most programs required direct access to patient medical chart and patient consultation sessions by appointment.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To follow the current practice of community pharmacy, exploring the effect of an intervention program on blood pressure (BP) and factors affecting BP.
AB  - METHODS: Treated hypertensive patients were enrolled in a 9-month controlled study involving 9 community pharmacies. The PRECEDE-PROCEED model was used as conceptual framework to identify factors affecting BP, to incorporate those factors in an intervention program, and to evaluate the impact of the program. A computerized decision-aid tool was used by pharmacists from 4 pharmacies to provide pharmaceutical care to subjects (n = 41); pharmacists from the 5 other pharmacies performed usual care (n = 59). As there was a statistically significant interaction due to family income in describing the impact of pharmacists' intervention on BP, population was stratified by family income in the analyses.
AB  - RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the pharmacy program resulted in significant systolic BP reduction (-7.8 vs. 0.5 mm Hg; p = 0.01) and an increase in the proportion of controlled patients only for those with high incomes. In the high-income group, the program also had a positive impact on physical activity, self-reported adherence, health concerns, and information transmitted. The low-income group did not appear to benefit from the program.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist intervention can modify factors affecting adherence, improve adherence, and reduce BP levels in patients treated with antihypertensive agents. Impact of pharmacist intervention on BP differed according to patient income status.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a medication adherence self-efficacy scale in hypertensive African-American patients.
AB  - Self-efficacy, a known predictor of a wide range of health behaviors, has not been investigated in studies of adherence to antihypertensive medications. A medication adherence self-efficacy scale was developed and evaluated in ambulatory hypertensive African-American patients in two sequential phases. For the item-generation phase, open-ended interviews with 106 patients were used to elicit their experiences with taking antihypertensive medications. Using qualitative techniques, responses were recorded verbatim, coded, and sorted into nine categories of barriers and facilitators of medication adherence. Concepts from categories were formatted into an initial 43-item self-efficacy questionnaire, which was administered to another group of 72 patients for the item analyses phase. Twenty-six items were retained for the final self-efficacy scale based on item-to-total correlation coefficient >0.5, kappa >0.4, and clinical relevance of individual items. Clinicians and researchers can use this scale to identify situations in which patients have low self-efficacy in adhering to prescribed medications.

TI  - Special intervention reduces CVD mortality for adherent participants in the multiple risk factor intervention trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient adherence affects treatment efficacy, and surprisingly, adherence is frequently associated with reductions in mortality for those receiving placebo.
AB  - METHODS: This study considers the role of trial adherence for men (N = 12,338) in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), a prospective study of 9-year follow-up mortality following randomization to Special Intervention (SI) or Usual Care (UC). Annual visit attendance rates were used as a measure of adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: A significant Adherence x Group Assignment interaction (p =.002) revealed that SI significantly reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality for highly adherent participants, RR =.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] =.84-.99) but significantly increased CVD mortality for poorly adherent participants, RR = 1.28 (95% CI = 1.05-1.57) when compared to UC. These associations remained after controlling for baseline characteristics (e.g., income), reported illness, or occurrence of a nonfatal CVD event during the trial. The beneficial effect of SI among the adherent participants was partly due to reduced smoking and diastolic blood pressure levels during the trial.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: SI significantly reduced the risk of CVD mortality for participants adherent with the MRFIT, and this effect was accounted for by positive changes in CVD risk factors. These findings suggest a method for evaluating treatment efficacy in subgroups determined by patient responses (e.g., adherence to annual assessment visits) to the treatment program after randomization.

TI  - Academic detailing to improve antihypertensive prescribing patterns.
AB  - Several studies indicate that treatment of hypertension in the United States does not follow recommendations from expert bodies. We thus implemented a program using academic detailers to increase practitioner compliance with antihypertensive treatment guidelines. Five Veterans Affairs medical facilities including academic medical centers and community based outpatient clinics were chosen for the intervention. Pharmacists were trained as academic detailers, and the intervention included lectures, educational materials, provider profiling, and meetings with 25 to 50 providers each. After intervention, the proportion of hypertensives receiving calcium antagonists decreased from 43% to 38% (P <.001), whereas the proportion receiving a beta blocker or thiazide diuretic increased from 58% to 64% (P <.001). For hypertensive subjects with diabetes mellitus or congestive heart failure, the proportion receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker increased from 72% to 76% for the former and from 74% to 78% for the latter (P <.001 for both). Among hypertensive subjects with coronary artery disease an increase in beta blocker use was noted after intervention (P <.001 for change from baseline). Prescribing patterns after academic detailing more closely followed national recommendations.

TI  - Intensive support to improve clinical decision making in cardiovascular care: a randomised controlled trial in general practice.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of feedback reports combined with outreach visits from trained non-physicians on the clinical decision making of general practitioners (GPs) in cardiovascular care.
AB  - DESIGN: Pragmatic cluster controlled trial with randomisation of practices to support (intervention group) or no special attention (control group); analysis after 2 years.
AB  - SETTING: 124 general practices in The Netherlands.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 185 GPs.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Compliance rates for 12 evidence-based indicators for the management of patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, angina pectoris, or heart failure. The evaluation relied on the prospective recording of patient encounters by the participating GPs.
AB  - RESULTS: The GPs reported 30 101 clinical decisions at baseline and 22 454 decisions after the intervention. A significant improvement was seen for five of the 12 indicators: assessment of risk factors in patients with hypercholesterolaemia (odds ratio 2.04; 95% CI 1.44 to 2.88) or angina pectoris (3.07; 1.08 to 8.79), provision of information and advice to patients with hypercholesterolaemia (1.58, 1.17 to 2.13) or hypertension (1.55, 1.35 to 1.77), and checking for clinical signs of deterioration in patients with heart failure (4.11, 2.17 to 7.77). Single handed practices, non-training practices, and practices with older GPs gained particular benefit from the intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Intensive support from trained non-physicians can alter certain aspects of the clinical decision making of GPs in cardiovascular care. The effect is small and the strategy needs further development.

TI  - Effect of estrogen plus progestin on stroke in postmenopausal women: the Women's Health Initiative: a randomized trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial of estrogen plus progestin was stopped early because of adverse effects, including an increased risk of stroke in the estrogen plus progestin group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of estrogen plus progestin on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and in subgroups, and to determine whether the effect of estrogen plus progestin was modified by baseline levels of blood biomarkers.
AB  - DESIGN: Multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial involving 16 608 women aged 50 through 79 years with an average follow-up of 5.6 years. Baseline levels of blood-based markers of inflammation, thrombosis, and lipid levels were measured in the first 140 centrally confirmed stroke cases and 513 controls.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Participants received 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall strokes and stroke subtype and severity were centrally adjudicated by stroke neurologists.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one patients (1.8%) in the estrogen plus progestin and 107 (1.3%) in the placebo groups had strokes. Overall 79.8% of strokes were ischemic. For combined ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, the intention-to-treat hazard ratio (HR) for estrogen plus progestin vs placebo was 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.68); with adjustment for adherence, the HR was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.08-2.08). The HR for ischemic stroke was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.09-1.90) and for hemorrhagic stroke, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.43-1.56). Point estimates of the HRs indicate that excess risk of all stroke was apparent in all age groups, in all categories of baseline stroke risk, and in women with and without hypertension, prior history of cardiovascular disease, use of hormones, statins, or aspirin. Other risk factors for stroke, including smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, lower use of vitamin C supplements, blood-based biomarkers of inflammation, higher white blood cell count, and higher hematocrit levels did not modify the effect of estrogen plus progestin on stroke risk.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen plus progestin increases the risk of ischemic stroke in generally healthy postmenopausal women. Excess risk for all strokes attributed to estrogen plus progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women examined.

TI  - Guideline implementation in a multicenter study with an estimated 44% relative cardiovascular event risk reduction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent of cardiovascular risk reduction by implementing coronary prevention guidelines needs to be documented in various population samples.
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: This is a multicenter study to assess the impact of risk reduction in cardiovascular events upon implementation of coronary prevention guidelines in patients with or at high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) in the setting of clinical practice.
AB  - METHODS: Enrolled volunteers numbered 2,021. Inclusion criteria postulated a minimum of 20-40% cardiovascular event risk in the subsequent 10 years as estimated from the risk table of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines. The estimated CHD risk reduction was assessed in terms of the Framingham risk scores at baseline and at 12 months, computed from the data of each individual. Data of the compliant group (making up half of the initial participants) at the end of the study, along with absolute and relative risk reductions in the compliant group, were analyzed.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean global risk burden was 25.9% at baseline, reduced through multilateral preventive measures in absolute terms by 9.4% at 6 months and by 11.7% at 12 months; the latter represents a relative risk reduction of 44%. Independent variables determining the (enhanced) reduction in risk level at the end of 12 months included (high) level of baseline risk, (high) degree of compliance with treatment, younger age, female gender, smoking, and (high) baseline triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) ratio. While the relative reduction in patients with CHD amounted to 43%, a reduction of 46% (p<0.001) was obtained in the setting of primary prevention. Diabetes emerged as a factor modestly limiting the extent of risk reduction. While subjects without hypertension revealed a decline of coronary risk by merely 8.7%, those with hypertension showed a decline by 12.7% (p<0.001). Risk reductions were accompanied by a decrease of mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of 25.4%, a rise in mean HDL-C level of 5 mg/dl, a decrease in mean systolic blood pressure of 26 mmHg. Forty-five percent of smokers succeeded in discontinuing the habit.
AB  - CONCLUSION: By implementing standard prevention guidelines in the Turkish population among 1,000 compliant high-risk men and women and among 1,000 patients with CHD, prevention of cardiovascular events could be expected in 117 persons in the subsequent 10 years.

TI  - Patients' views of high blood pressure, its treatment and risks.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the understanding and beliefs of a sample of Australian patients about high blood pressure and its therapy, and to examine the accuracy of their assessment of their own risk.
AB  - METHOD: A cross sectional study in two general practices in Perth, Western Australia. Interviews were conducted with 55 consecutive patients aged 40-80 years of age with uncomplicated hypertension. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected on patients' beliefs about the nature, symptoms, causes and treatment of high blood pressure as well as their adherence to antihypertensive medications during the preceding month. Patients also estimated their own risk of stroke or myocardial infarction.
AB  - RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients (65%) described high blood pressure within an appropriate biomedical definition. Forty-five percent attributed a variety of symptoms to their high blood pressure while 55% believed that stress was a cause of their high blood pressure. Three-quarters (73%) were fully adherent to their medications in the preceding month. Seventy-one percent and 62% of patients were aware that stroke and heart attack respectively are possible consequences of high blood pressure. They significantly overestimated their risk of stroke and myocardial infarction.
AB  - CONCLUSION: One-third of treated hypertensive patients are poorly informed about the causes and effects of hypertension, and overestimate their risk of both stroke and heart attack, as well as the benefit derived from treatment.

TI  - [The effect of walking exercise on aerobic capacity and serum lipids in type 2 diabetics]. [Czech]
AB  - Regular physical activity can have a favourable impact on other risk factors of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and associated diabetes (DM), such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and others. This important part of treatment of diabetes is frequently difficult to implement because of the lack of willingness ("adherence") of type 2 diabetics to practice regular exercise, and unequivocal data are lacking on the intensity of exercise which will influence effectively these risk factors and be at the same time safe, readily available and psychologically acceptable. The objective of the work was to find out whether walking, i.e. locomotor activity with a low to medium intensity can effectively influence parameters of aerobic capacity and blood lipids. The authors submit the results of two groups of type 2 diabetics. The experimental group B (n = 10, age 57 +/- 7 years, BMI 31 +/- 3, duration of DM 8 +/- 5 years) participated in a 12-week training programme of walking; at the beginning and at the end of this period indicators of aerobic capacity at the level of the anaerobic threshold (VO2ANP) were evaluated as well as at the level of the symptom limited maximum (VO2SL, TepO2SL), and the blood lipid levels. In the control group A (n = 6, age 58 +/- 7 years, BMI 32 +/- 4) indicators of aerobic capacity and blood lipids were assessed after a 12-week period of the usual habitual physical activity. In group B the 12-week walking training led to significant improvement of parameters of aerobic capacity at the level of the anaerobic threshold (ANP), oxygen pulse at the level of the symptom limits maximum (SL) and a significant reduction of total and LDL cholesterol. In the control group no significant changes occurred in aerobic capacity nor blood lipid values. The training programme where walking was selected as physical activity with a low to medium intensity can be considered suitable for everyday life of motivated patients with type 2 diabetics, preferably in the form of a domestic training programme. The prerequisite of success is its regular and frequent evaluation by health professionals.

TI  - Polypharmacy and medication adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine medication adherence and predictors of suboptimal adherence in a community cohort of patients with diabetes and to test the hypothesis that adherence decreases with increased number of medicines prescribed.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 128 randomly selected patients with type 2 diabetes from a single community health center responded to a pharmacist-administered questionnaire regarding medication use. Survey data were linked to clinical data available from the electronic medical record. We assessed self-reported adherence rates for each diabetes-related medicine, barriers and attitudes regarding medication use, and HbA(1c), total cholesterol, and blood pressure levels.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients were taking a mean of 4.1 (+/-1.9) diabetes-related medicines. The average 7-day adherence was 6.7 +/- 1.1 days. Total number of medicines prescribed was not correlated with medication adherence. Adherence was significantly lower for medicines not felt to be improving current or future health (6.1 vs. 6.9 days out of 7, P < 0.001). Among patients on three or more medicines, 71% (15 of 21 patients) with suboptimal adherence were perfectly adherent with all but one medicine. Side effects were the most commonly reported problem with medication use. Of 29 medicines causing side effects that interfered with adherence, 24 (83%) did so for >1 month, and only 7 (24%) were reported to the patient's primary care physician.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, patients reported very high medication adherence rates regardless of number of medicines prescribed. Among patients on multiple medicines, most patients with suboptimal adherence were perfectly adherent to all but one medicine. Unreported side effects and a lack of confidence in immediate or future benefits were significant predictors of suboptimal adherence. Physicians should not feel deterred from prescribing multiple agents in order to achieve adequate control of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

TI  - A pharmacy-based health promotion programme in hypertension: cost-benefit analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To weigh the costs and benefits of a pharmacy-based health promotion programme implemented in four pharmacies of the Quebec City area, Canada. This programme was developed to improve blood pressure control through activities aimed at improving the quality of prescribing and the adherence to treatment.
AB  - DESIGN: Nine pharmacies in Quebec City were included, of which four pharmacies were assigned to the implementation of the health promotion programme. Each time a study participant came to one of these pharmacies to refill his/her antihypertensive medication, the pharmacist would measure and record the participant's blood pressure and assess adherence to drug treatment. The other five pharmacies delivered usual care. The duration of the intervention programme was 9 months. Costs included direct, indirect, and fixed costs, and the costs of pharmacist intervention. Benefits were measured using cost savings induced by pharmacist intervention. Willingness to pay was also considered. A bootstrap method was used to test the between-group difference.
AB  - PERSPECTIVE: The study was performed from a societal perspective.
AB  - STUDY PARTICIPANTS: 100 individuals aged between 34 and 80 years residing in the Quebec City area and taking antihypertensive medication.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: Participants exposed to the programme had a significant decrease in mean direct costs and a significant increase in mean indirect costs compared with non-exposed participants. Pharmacist interventions involved a mean cost of 30.68 Canadian dollars ($ Can) per participant exposed to the programme. On average, exposed participants were willing to pay $ Can 0.54 per month after the intervention period. Benefits were about ten times higher than costs (1998 values).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of this intervention programme seems promising in the quest to improve blood pressure control in terms of both costs and benefits.

TI  - Rational Prescribing in Primary Care (RaPP-trial). A randomised trial of a tailored intervention to improve prescribing of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs in general practice [ISRCTN48751230].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The underlying reasons for differences between clinical practice and systematically developed guidelines vary from one clinical problem to another. It is therefore logical to tailor strategies to support the implementation of guidelines to address identified barriers to change. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effects of a tailored intervention to support the implementation of systematically developed guidelines for the use of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Unblinded, cluster-randomised trial. 150 general practices will be recruited from two geographical areas in Norway, and randomised to the intervention or control group (passive dissemination of guidelines). Outcomes will be measured for all eligible patients seen in the participating practices during one year after the intervention. A multifaceted intervention has been tailored to address identified barriers to change. Key components are an educational outreach visit with audit and feedback, and computerised reminders. Pharmacists will conduct the visits. During the outreach visit the main recommendations will be presented and software will be installed that links to the electronic medical record systems used in the participating practices. The software will perform an audit that will be fed back during the visit, present pop-up reminders for patients with high blood pressure or cholesterol, and provide a cardiovascular risk calculator and patient education material. The main outcomes are the proportions of 1) first time prescriptions for hypertension where thiazides are not prescribed, 2) patients not assessed for cardiovascular risk before prescribing antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering drugs, and 3) patients treated for hypertension or high cholesterol for three months or more who have not achieved recommended treatment goals.

TI  - Effectiveness of report cards based on chart audits of residents' adherence to practice guidelines on practice performance: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical record audits have been used to provide physicians with feedback about their compliance with preventive health and disease management recommendations.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if report cards summarizing medicine residents' preventive health and disease management practices can be used as a feedback tool to improve practice performance.
AB  - METHODS: Randomized, blinded, controlled study of 44 internal medicine residents using an individualized 78-item report card based on outpatient record audits.
AB  - RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-seven charts were retrospectively audited at baseline and 284 charts in follow-up. There were no significant differences in baseline performance between the residents in the intervention and control group. There were no differences in performance scores between residents receiving report cards and those who had not in immunizations, counseling, total preventive health, diabetes, hypertension, and total disease management.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Intensive data-based feedback using report cards may not be a successful way to improve ambulatory performance of medical house officers.

TI  - Evaluation of a pharmaceutical care program for hypertensive patients in rural Portugal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the community pharmacist's capacity to positively influence the results of antihypertensive drug therapy through a pharmaceutical care program and to determine what factors limit the program.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized, controlled study.
AB  - SETTING: Private pharmacy caring for a semiliterate, rural Portuguese population.
AB  - PATIENTS: Random sample of 100 patients with a diagnosis of essential hypertension who had been on drug treatment for less than 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 50) or a control (n = 50) group.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Individualized health promotion by a research pharmacist involving monthly appointments for 6 months to monitor blood pressure; assess adherence to treatment; prevent, detect, and resolve drug-related problems (DRPs); and encourage nonpharmacologic measures for blood pressure control. Control patients received traditional care.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Control of blood pressure; decreases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure; number of detected, resolved, and prevented DRPs.
AB  - RESULTS: From the initial sample of 100 patients, 41 patients in the intervention group and 41 patients in the control group completed the longitudinal study. After 6 months, prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure decreased by 77.4% in the intervention group (P < .0001) and by 10.3% in the control group (P = .48). Systolic blood pressure fell from a mean +/- standard deviation of 152 mm Hg +/- 23 mm Hg to 129 +/- 15 mm Hg in intervention patients and 148 +/- 16 mm Hg to 143 +/- 20 mm Hg in control patients (P < .001). Twenty-four of 29 (83%) detected actual DRPs were resolved. About 40% of potential DRPs were prevented.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In this rural community, a pharmaceutical care program was associated with significant improvements in blood pressure control in hypertensive patients.

TI  - Follow-up in a lipid clinic improves the management of risk factors in cardiovascular disease patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The implementation of treatment guidelines is lacking worldwide.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether follow-up in a specialized lipid clinic improves the achievement rate of the treatment guidelines, as formulated by the National Cholesterol Education Program and the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.
AB  - METHODS: The study group included patients who were referred to the lipid clinic because of hyperlipidemia. At each of five visits over a 12 month period, lipid levels, liver and creatine kinase levels, body mass index, and adherence to diet and medications were measured, and achievement of the NCEP target level was assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 1,133 patients (mean age 61.3 years, 60% males) were studied. Additional risk factors for atherosclerosis included hypertension (41%), type II diabetes mellitus (21%), smoking (17%), and a positive family history of coronary artery disease (32%). All patients had evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease (coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular diseases). The low density lipoprotein target of < 100 mg was present in only 22% of patients before enrollment, with improvement of up to 57% after the follow-up period. During follow-up, blood pressure control was improved (from 38% at the time of referral to 88% after 12 months, P < 0.001), as was glycemic control in diabetic patients (HgA1C improved from 8.2% to 7.1% after 12 months, P < 0.001). Improved risk factor control was due to increased compliance to medication treatment (from 66% at enrollment to more than 90% after 12 months), as well as careful attention to risk factor management that translated into a change in the treatment profile during the follow-up. There was an increase in the use of the following medications: aspirin from 68% to 96%, statins from 42% to 88%, beta blockers from 20% to 40%, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors from 28% to 42%; while calcium channel blocker use decreased from 40% to 30% in patients during follow-up.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Follow-up of patients in a specialized clinic enhances the achievement of LDL-cholesterol treatment goals as well as other risk factor treatment goals, due to increased patient compliance and increased use of medications.

TI  - Epidemiological aspects of adherence to the treatment of hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the reasons given by patients for interrupting their pharmacological treatment of hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: We carried out an observational cross-sectional study, in which a questionnaire was applied and blood pressure was measured in 401 patients in different centers of the state of Bahia. The patients selected had been diagnosed with hypertension and were not on antihypertensive treatment for at least 60 days. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the groups were analyzed.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 401 patients, 58.4% were females, 55.6% of whom white; 60.5% of the males were white. The major reasons alleged for not adhering to treatment were as follows (for males and females respectively): normalization of blood pressure (41.3% and 42.3%); side effects of the medications (31.7% and 24.8%); forgetting to use the medication (25.2% and 20.1%); cost of medication (21.6% and 20.1%); fear of mixing alcohol and medication (23.4% and 3.8%); ignoring the need for continuing the treatment (15% and 21.8%); use of an alternative treatment (11.4% and 17.1%); fear of intoxication (9.6% and 12.4%); fear of hypotension (9.6% and 12%); and fear of mixing the medication with other drugs (8.4% and 6.1%).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that most factors concerning the abandonment of the treatment of hypertension are related to lack of information, and that, despite the advancement in antihypertensive drugs, side effects still account for most abandonments of treatment.

TI  - Terminal digit preference and single-number preference in the Syst-Eur trial: influence of quality control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Terminal digit and single-number preference may produce inaccuracy and biased results when measuring blood pressure. We describe these preferences in the Syst-Eur randomized placebo-controlled trial of the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension and describe how we sought to eliminate these problems.
AB  - METHODS: The Data Monitoring Committee of the trial conducted yearly quality control meetings in Belgium and visited the participating centres to check their adherence to the protocol. These meetings involved identifying terminal digit preference, improving blood pressure control and boosting recruitment.
AB  - RESULTS: The prevalence of use of terminal digit zero when measuring sitting systolic blood pressure (first readings) reduced from an average of 42.4% in the year prior to the date when a centre first randomized a patient to 31.5, 25, 22.3, 26.3, 23.2 and 22% in the subsequent 6 years. This trend was independent of the calendar year during which a centre entered the trial and supports the hypothesis that data-quality monitoring, including the feedback of digit preference to centres, led to a reduction in terminal digit zero preference. In addition, a higher than expected prevalence of the systolic blood pressure value of 148 mmHg was found in the active treatment groups in the double-blind phase. Selection for 148 mmHg persisted over time and constituted a single-number preference bias. This arose from the instruction to investigators to reduce systolic blood pressure to below 150 mmHg.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Monitoring and feedback of data quality should be undertaken to minimize digit and number preference. Automatic devices should ideally be employed to help to avoid these problems as long as the devices are fully validated and regularly serviced, and providing that readings are not rejected and repeated.

TI  - Improving blood pressure control in diabetes: limitations of a clinical reminder in influencing physician behavior.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypertension should be aggressively treated, especially in diabetic patients. But studies of physician prescribing habits reveal that physicians often delay making medication changes or initiating antihypertensive therapy. A chart-based reminder was designed to improve physician medication prescribing in this clinical situation.
AB  - METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia. Patients with diabetes and hypertension were selected. A highly visible chart reminder was applied to the front of outpatient charts in the intervention group practice. A chart review was conducted to assess physician-directed medication changes. A successful outcome was defined as any antihypertensive medication increase or addition at that same visit.
AB  - RESULTS: Physicians were more likely to intensify antihypertensive medication as the blood pressure increased regardless of the reminder. Overall, only 33% of visits resulted in a medication change, even though 93% of patients had elevations over target blood pressure at the follow-up visit. Physicians in the intervention and control groups made changes to medication at similar rates (chi 2 = 0.621, p = .511).
AB  - DISCUSSION: In this study, a chart reminder failed to improve physician compliance with the clinical guideline for hypertension management in diabetics, Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation, Prevention and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. To inform the design of effective intervention strategies, further research should explore specific barriers to guideline adherence in this clinical situation.

TI  - Racial differences in compliance with NCEP-II recommendations for secondary prevention at a Veterans Affairs medical center.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current NCEP-II guidelines recommend that secondary prevention patients should lower their LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) below 100 mg/dL. We implemented a Lipid Management Program to aggressively achieve this goal. We report on the impact of this intervention on compliance rates for African Americans (AA) vs Whites (W) treated with an HMG-Co-A reductase inhibitor for secondary prevention at the veterans affairs hospital.
AB  - METHODS: We reviewed all patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or diabetes mellitus (DM) at our institution on monotherapy with an HMG-Co-A reductase inhibitor in 1999. We examined the initial and post intervention lipid profiles for both races.
AB  - RESULTS: The groups differed in that compared to the Whites, the AA were younger (65.8 vs 71.4, P = .0001); had a higher prevalence of type 2 DM (70.1% vs 40.8%, P = .001), had more obesity (57.5% vs 41.0%, P = .001), and were more likely to smoke (42.5% vs 9.6%, P = .001). AA had more clinic visits (5.04/pt vs 3.95/pt, P = .0001) and fasting lipid profiles (4.46/pt vs 3.0/pt, P = .0001). There was no difference in the prevalence of hypertension or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor dose. AA were less likely to achieve the goal for LDL-C recommended by NCEP-II (40.94% vs 56.9%, P = .001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite equivalent doses of statin, AA were less likely to meet NCEP-II recommendations. This occurred even though AA had more clinic visits and lipid profiles. Our intervention did not narrow this racial gap in compliance rates. Possible explanations include: 1) variations in patient compliance; 2) impact of differences in lifestyle (DM, obesity, and smoking); and 3) the need for more intensive drug therapy in patients starting with a higher baseline LDL-C.

TI  - The effect of n-3 fatty acids on coronary atherosclerosis: results from SCIMO, an angiographic study, background and implications.
AB  - According to the model of "response to injury," the arterial endothelium is occasionally injured in hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and in other states known as risk factors. The ensuing inflammatory response is modulated by cytokines and growth factors, among them platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In two independent studies, we demonstrated that mRNA levels for PDGF-A and -B and for MCP-1 are reduced after ingestion of n-3 fatty acids by human volunteers. This reduction persists after monocyte stimulation/differentiation by adherence. Moreover, the reduction is brought about only by dietary n-3 fatty acids and not by other classes of unsaturated fatty acids (n-6 or n-9). This appears to be one major mechanism of action of reduced progression/increased regression of established coronary artery disease by ingestion of 1.5 g/d n-3 fatty acids, as assessed by coronary angiography in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind intervention study in 223 patients. The study was conducted according to "Good Clinical Practice," comprehensive rules regulating investigations with pharmaceutical compounds. Together, our investigations lend support to the importance of PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and MCP-1 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and the beneficial role of n-3 fatty acids therein.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: First, to assess whether it is useful for a patient to take part in the analysis of the causes of non-compliance with therapy for hypertension. Second, to design a questionnaire to evaluate the causes and the degree of adherence to therapy and to construct indicators on the basis of this. Lastly, to determine the effectiveness of the feedback of the evaluation of these indicators to health professionals, as a method of improving hypertense patients' adherence to therapy.
AB  - DESIGN: Qualitative study through the focus group technique; b) quasi-experimental design of independent samples between evaluation and re-evaluation with two study groups: experimental (3 PC health centres) and control (3 PC health centres).
AB  - SETTING: PC health centres.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Patients over 18 on medical hypertension treatment.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: First phase: analysis of the reasons for non-compliance with therapy through the group focus technique and design of the questionnaire to evaluate factors associated with non-compliance. Second phase: evaluation and pilot study of the questionnaire. For this, a questionnaire to assess therapy adherence and to determine the weight of related factors will be sent to a random sample of hypertense patients at each Health Centre. Third phase: intervention. A report with the results of the first assessment will be sent to the health professionals of the experimental group. Fourth phase: re-evaluation of the indicators of adherence, and analysis of the improvement achieved.

TI  - Impact of the cost of prescription drugs on clinical outcomes in indigent patients with heart disease.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact that economic relief for prescription drugs to indigent patients with cardiovascular disease has on indicators of disease control.
AB  - DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
AB  - SETTING: University inner-city outpatient clinic.
AB  - PATIENTS: One hundred sixty-three indigent patients with heart disease who were uninsured or whose insurance plan did not provide prescription drug coverage and who had baseline data.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Patients were assisted in obtaining prescription drugs, free of charge, in an attempt to improve adherence to their drug regimens.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary end point was to determine if cardiovascular outcome measures (i.e., international normalized ratio [INR], blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, and hospitalizations) and drug adherence improved in all patients after 6 months of prescription assistance compared with a 6-month baseline period. In patients receiving warfarin, mean INR increased from 2.44 +/- 0.64 at baseline to 2.61 +/- 0.53 at 6 months (p<0.05). In patients with hypertension, mean blood pressure decreased from 138 +/- 20/80 +/- 11 mm Hg at baseline to 138 +/- 19/78 +/- 12 mm Hg at 6 months (p<0.05 for diastolic blood pressure only). The mean LDL level for patients on lipid-lowering drugs significantly decreased from 126 +/- 39 mg/dl at baseline to 108 +/- 38 mg/dl at 6 months (p<0.001). For each disease measure, the improved disease control seen at 6 months persisted throughout 24 months of follow-up. Hospitalizations for the entire cohort decreased from 85 at baseline to 49 at 6 months. Patient drug adherence improved from 48.5% at baseline to 72.7% at 6 months (p<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Drug adherence and clinical outcomes improved, and the number of hospitalizations declined when cardiovascular drugs were obtained for patients who could not afford to pay for them. Health care insurance plans that do not provide coverage for cardiovascular prescription drugs may be more costly secondary to poor disease control and increased hospitalizations.

TI  - Comparing the efficacy of staff versus housestaff instruction in an intervention to improve hypertension management.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether a resident physician can be as effective as a faculty opinion leader in changing physicians' compliance with a hypertension practice guideline.
AB  - METHOD: At a general internal medicine clinic associated with an internal medicine residency program, sequential charts were reviewed for patients with uncontrolled or new-onset hypertension who were seen routinely during a two-week period. Subsequently, 23 providers were randomly assigned to an academic intervention to implement a hypertension practice guideline led by a single second-year resident instructor (RI), and 21 providers were assigned to the same intervention led by a single staff internist (SI) with an interest in hypertension. The intervention involved academic detailing, chart audit with feedback, and behavior reinforcement. Six weeks later, the chart audit was repeated to assess the change in practice patterns among providers taught by the RI compared with those taught by the SI.
AB  - RESULTS: Overall, management consistent with the practice guideline improved from 32% (51/157) to 45% (56/123) (p < .01) after the intervention. This change was due to improvement in the care provided by providers from the SI-led intervention: 28% (17/60) to 57% (26/46) (p < .003). Providers from the RI-led intervention showed no improvement: 35% (34/97) to 39% (30/77) (p = NS).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This intervention was effective in improving providers' compliance with a hypertension practice guideline, but only when led by a faculty opinion leader. A resident instructor using the same format was unable to change the providers' behaviors.

TI  - Frequency of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement and frequency of results < or=100 mg/dl among patients who had coronary events (Northwest VA Network Study).
AB  - This population-based, cross-sectional analysis targeted all veterans with coronary heart disease (CHD) who were active patients in primary care or cardiology clinics in the Veterans Health Administration Northwest Network from July 1998 to June 1999. We report guideline compliance rates, including whether low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was measured, and if measured, whether the LDL was < or=100 mg/dl. In addition, we utilized multivariate logistic regression to determine patient characteristics associated with LDL measurements and levels. Of 13,891 active patients with CHD, 5,552 (40.0%) did not have a current LDL measurement. Of those with LDL measurements, 39.1% were at the LDL goal of < or =100 mg/dl, whereas 26.5% had LDL > or =130 mg/dl. Male gender, younger age, history of angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting, current hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and angina pectoris were associated with increased likelihood of LDL measurement. Older age and current diabetes and angina were associated with increased likelihood of LDL being < or =100 mg/dl, if measured. Although these rates of guideline adherence in the CHD population compare well to previously published results, they continue to be unacceptably low for optimal clinical outcomes. Attention to both LDL measurement and treatment (if elevated) is warranted.

TI  - Rate of health insurance reimbursement and adherence to anti-hypertensive treatment among Japanese patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although several studies have reported the effects of free medical care on compliance in patients with hypertension, no study has reported the effects of an economic incentive, such as subsidized medical costs, on compliance with medication protocol, in patients with hypertension. The unique characteristics of the Japanese health insurance system provide for a 10% decrease in the subsidy for medication immediately on retirement (approximately 60 years of age) for insured patients, and a 100% subsidy for insured patients who are 70 years of age or older. We examined the association between level of health insurance coverage and follow-up rate of medical treatment among Japanese patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: The subjects, from throughout Japan, were patients with hypertension (n=1236). The study was conducted in 1991. The odds of completing a 1-year treatment in relation to the rate of health insurance reimbursement were calculated using multiple logistic regression analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: We found the following. (1) Compared with the base group, the odds of completing a 1-year treatment increased to 2.62 or 2.51 in the group whose reimbursement rate was 100%. (2) Compared with the base group, the odds of completing a 1-year treatment was no larger than 1 in the group whose reimbursement rate had been 100% for more than 6 years ('76-'). (3) Compared with the base level, the odds of completing a 1-year treatment increased to 1-1.81 in the group whose liability decreased to 80%.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Although the results imply that even a small economic incentive might be effective in securing a patient's compliance with anti-hypertensive medical treatment, the effect appear limited in both duration and magnitude.

TI  - Characteristics of 15,314 hypertensive patients at high coronary risk. The VALUE trial. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation.
AB  - Valsartan is an orally active, selective antagonist of the angiotensin II-1 (AT1) receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) Trial of Cardiovascular Events in Hypertension is a double-blind, randomized prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of valsartan with those of the calcium-antagonist amlodipine on the reduction of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with essential hypertension, aged 50 years and older, and at particularly high risk of coronary events were enrolled. 18,119 patients were screened and 15,314 patients in 31 countries were randomized mainly between January 1998 and December 1999. These hypertensives had a mean blood pressure of 154.7/87.5 mmHg at the time of their randomization to blinded medication. The population comprises both genders (men 57.6%), Caucasians (89.1%), mean age 67.2 years, mean body mass index 28.6 kg/m2, coronary heart disease (45.8%), high cholesterol (33.0%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (31.7%) and smokers (24.0%). More than 92% of the randomized participants had been treated for high blood pressure for at least 6 months when screened for the study. The randomized population is now being treated (goal blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg) in adherence with the protocol until at least 1450 patients experience primary cardiac endpoint defined as clinically evident or aborted myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or death caused by coronary heart disease.

TI  - Issues in hypertension: drug tolerability and special populations. [Review] [33 refs]
AB  - Improvements in the death rate from coronary heart disease and in the control of hypertension have leveled off in recent years, reversing a trend toward steady improvement that began in 1972. Of the roughly 20% of Americans who suffer from hypertension, only 29% achieve adequate control (<140/90 mm Hg) with treatment and nearly half receive no treatment at all. Poor adherence to therapy doubtless plays a key role in this failure. As a major cause of poor adherence, tolerability becomes an extremely important element in any discussion of effective antihypertensive treatment. Despite their efficacy in treating hypertension, diuretics, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers have all been associated with numerous side effects, including increased serum lipid levels, insulin resistance, and edema. With the introduction of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, patients were able to achieve blood pressure goals with fewer side effects. These agents, however, cause an irritating cough in up to 19% of patients. A newer class of drugs, the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), have similar effects to the ACE inhibitors, but their highly selective nature produces even fewer side effects. Eprosartan is a structurally unique ARB. Like the other ARB, this promising new agent has a side effect profile similar to placebo, and its response rate rivals or exceeds that of enalapril. Although it remains to be seen whether the ARB can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, preliminary data from the Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly (ELITE) trial appear to be promising.

TI  - The effects of postal and telephone reminders on compliance with pravastatin therapy in a national registry: results of the first myocardial infarction risk reduction program.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Noncompliance with cardiovascular therapy and prevention initiatives is well documented.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the First Myocardial Infarction (MI) Risk Reduction Program, an open-label drug registry involving mainly primary-care patients at increased risk of a first MI, was to examine the effects of postal and telephone reminders, as well as demographic and other baseline characteristics, on patient self-reported compliance with pravastatin treatment. A second objective was to determine whether regimen adherence was associated with the adoption of other lifestyle modifications recommended to decrease the risk of coronary artery disease.
AB  - METHODS: Patients with risk scores of > or = 4 on a scale of -1 to +16 for men and -1 to +17 for women on the First Heart Attack Risk Test were considered to be at increased risk of a first MI and eligible for enrollment in the registry program. An elevated total cholesterol level despite dietary interventions was an additional inclusion criterion. Patients were prospectively randomized (4:1) to either an intervention involving postal and telephone reminders (about coronary risk reduction and medication compliance), which were sent during the first 2 months of pravastatin treatment, or usual care. Both groups received reminder postcards at 4 and 5 months, in addition to counseling by physicians about coronary risk reduction. At 3 and 6 months (or study discontinuation), patients completed and mailed to the program-coordinating center questionnaires concerning compliance with care, including current use of prescribed pravastatin, as well as self-reported adoption of other lifestyle modifications, such as changing eating habits, losing weight, increasing physical activity, and/or quitting smoking. Compliance with pravastatin therapy and with these coronary risk-reducing behaviors was also assessed by physicians at the 3-month follow-up visit.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 10,335 patients were in the intervention group, and 2765 received usual care. The 2 groups were well balanced at baseline with respect to age, race, and total cholesterol values. Neither early reminders nor baseline patient characteristics were significantly associated with reported pravastatin compliance rates, which were approximately 79% overall. However, according to self-reports at 6 months, regimen compliance was associated with the adoption of other coronary risk-reducing behaviors.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that early telephone and postal reminders do not improve compliance with drug treatment or with recommended coronary risk-reducing behaviors.

AB  - As more high-risk hypertensives are treated and the need for more intensive antihypertensive therapy is recognized, combination therapies are increasingly used. For initial therapy, particularly for relatively low-risk patients, low-dose combinations are often appropriate. For those who require additional therapy, higher doses of combinations may provide further efficacy while minimizing dose-dependent side effects of monotherapy, thereby improving adherence to therapy. Those combination agents should provide 24-h control with one daily dose, thereby ensuring protection in the early morning hours. Combining an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker is a rational approach to treating hypertension. Not only does it provide significantly better blood pressure control than individual components used as monotherapy, it also minimizes dose-dependent side effects. Also, combining agents from different classes results in complementary mechanisms of action that provide other cardiovascular protective benefits.

TI  - Amlodipine/benazepril: fixed dose combination therapy for hypertension. [Review] [55 refs]
AB  - Myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and end-stage renal disease have all been linked to inadequate control of blood pressure. Despite overwhelming evidence that uncontrolled hypertension is responsible for a sizeable number of adverse health-related outcomes, control of the disease remains considerably suboptimal. Available data demonstrate that in order to achieve adequate blood pressure control, a large number of patients require therapy with more than one medication. Fixed dose combination antihypertensive therapy has many advantages over other treatment options. Positive effects on blood pressure control, rates of adherence, adverse effects and cost have been identified. Amlodipine/benazepril (Lotrel), Novartis) is a fixed dose combination product indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Although not currently recommended as first-line therapy, studies confirm that this combination of a long-acting calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor possesses substantial blood pressure lowering capabilities. Whereas adverse events tend to become more frequent with increasing doses of antihypertensive monotherapy, the rate of adverse events attributed to amlodipine/benazepril in clinical trials often correlates with rates ascribed to placebo. Amlodipine/benazepril is capable of sustaining blood pressure control over a 24 h period and appears to be minimally affected by an occasional dose omission. Unlike the older calcium antagonists, amlodipine is unlikely to cause alterations in myocardial contractility. Additionally, the amlodipine/benazepril combination product costs less than the same therapy administered as the individual components. It is, therefore, reasonable to consider therapy with amlodipine/benazepril in appropriate patients after an adequate trial of antihypertensive monotherapy. [References: 55]

TI  - The role of gender and family support on dietary compliance in an African American adolescent hypertension prevention study.
AB  - Social support experiences vary markedly across gender groups, and little is known about the role of social support in promoting healthy dietary compliance in African American adolescents who are at increased risk for developing hypertension. This study examined the relation between gender, dietary social support, and compliance to a low sodium diet. Casual blood pressures were also examined in relation to dietary compliance and gender One hundred eighty-four healthy African American adolescents (83 boys, 101 girls) participated in an intensive 5-day low sodium diet (50 mEq/24 hr) as part of a hypertension prevention program. Emotional dietary social support from family members and friends was measured at baseline. Compliance was defined as urinary sodium excretion of < or = 50 mEq/24 hr at postsodium restriction. The results indicated a significant Gender x Compliance effect for positive family support (p < .05). Girls who were compliant reported higher levels of dietary support from family members (19.2 +/- 7.8) than boys who were compliant (16.9 +/- 7.0). In contrast, boys who were compliant reported lower levels of dietary support from family members (16.9 +/- 7.0) than boys who were not compliant (20.2 +/- 7.5). Systolic blood pressure showed a trend toward decreasing in compliant participants (104.4 +/- 8.4 vs. 101.7 +/- 8.0, mm Hg, p < .06), but the effect diminished when Quetelet Index (kg/m2) was controlled for in the analyses (p < .12). These results suggest that higher levels of emotional dietary support from family members are associated with better adherence to short-term sodium restriction for African American girls as compared to boys. Further research is needed to determine the long-term impact of social support on sodium restriction in adolescent populations.

TI  - Global impact of stroke. [Review] [20 refs]
AB  - As the developing world becomes increasingly industrialized and urbanized, and its vast populations adopt more westernized diets and lifestyles, the burden of cardiovascular disease and disability is growing at an alarming rate. The results of prospective observational studies conducted in both western and eastern populations have established the strong association between the primary incidence of stroke and the level of blood pressure. Further, randomized clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy have demonstrated a reduction in primary stroke risk. Among persons with a history of cerebrovascular disease, data from the United Kingdom Transient Ischemic Attack Aspirin Trial (UKTIA) has demonstrated a similar relationship between blood pressure and secondary stroke risk. Trials of blood-pressure lowering in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease also suggested a reduction in stroke risk. However, patients numbers in these trials were small, and the results were not conclusive. PROGRESS (Perindopril pROtection aGainst Recurrent Stroke Study) is a large, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to provide a definitive answer to these questions. Its primary aim is to determine the effect of blood-pressure lowering on stroke incidence in patients with a history of a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. A total of 6,105 patients were randomized to receive perindopril (plus indapamide) or placebo in seven regions of the world. The current mean follow-up period exceeds 30 months, and a total follow-up period of at least 4 years is planned. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of other major cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, and of cognitive decline and dementia. Both the major event rate and the degree of adherence to randomized therapy exceed initial projections, which suggests that the study should have the power to achieve its main objectives by the planned completion date of 2001.

TI  - The contexts of adherence for African Americans with high blood pressure.
AB  - The contexts of adherence for African Americans with high blood pressure African American men between the ages of 18 and 49 years have the lowest rates of awareness, treatment and control of high blood pressure (HBP) of all age/race/gender groups in the United States. A qualitative study was done to gain an understanding of urban black males' experiences of living with HBP. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 black males. The interviews explored perceptions of health, health problems and priorities, and concerns of daily living that influenced appointment keeping and medication taking. The sample was a subset of 309 men participating in a 3-year clinical trial to improve HBP control in an inner city African-American population. Content analysis of transcribed interviews identified the following themes and related concerns: (a) personal contexts: meaning of health, high blood pressure and treatments; (b) social context: living as a young black male in an urban environment; and (c) cultural context of relating: patient-provider relationship can make a difference. Influencing participants' responses were: interpreting symptoms; adjusting medication taking; protecting personal privacy; allocating limited resources; dealing with addiction; and feeling cared for by a health care provider. Adherence appeared to be multifaceted and changing depending upon: the men's social, economic and personal circumstances; empathetic and non-judgemental assistance from providers; financial concerns and employment; and drug addiction. Findings are useful in refining high blood pressure interventions.

TI  - Maximizing medication adherence in low-income hypertensives: a pilot study.
AB  - A pilot study was conducted to examine the association between free medication and comprehensive care on blood pressure control for 60 adults with uncontrolled essential hypertension (mean blood pressure = 157/96 mm Hg) referred from a variety of primary care clinics at a public teaching hospital. Subjects received comprehensive care, free antihypertensive medication dispensed in the clinic, and patient education regarding hypertension and medication compliance. Matched-pair t-tests revealed average drops in blood pressure of 22 mm Hg systolic and 13 mm Hg diastolic for the entire sample from baseline to 6 months post-enrollment (both P's < .001). The comprehensive hypertension management program with education and free medication was significantly related to reduced blood pressure across the 6 months of the study period.

TI  - How to improve adherence with prescribed treatment in hypertensive patients?.
AB  - Low adherence of hypertensive patients to prescribed antihypertensive medications is a major cause of unsatisfactory blood pressure control. Several factors might have a negative influence on long-term adherence with treatment, for example a poor patient-doctor relationship and the presence of drug-induced side-effects. Various strategies are recommended in order to improve patient compliance, including educational programmes, self-measurement of blood pressure and monitoring of compliance. All methods may be helpful to encourage the patient to take the prescribed medication(s) regularly. It is also important to find a drug regimen which is at the same time simple, efficacious and well tolerated. Finally it should be pointed out that the motivation of the patient to follow the treatment requires the doctor to be equally motivated.

TI  - A clinic and community-based approach to hypertension control for an underserved minority population: design and methods.
AB  - This paper describes the design and methodology of the Community Hypertension Intervention Project (CHIP). CHIP is investigating the environmental and psychosocial factors related to treatment adherence and examining the effects of combining usual hypertension care with the effects of three interventions designed to improve patient compliance with treatment for high blood pressure in a high-risk, underserved minority population. Thirteen hundred and sixty-seven inner-city hypertension patients (75% black and 25% Hispanic) have agreed to participate in the 4-year longitudinal study. These participants were randomized to usual care or one of three intervention groups: individualized counseling sessions; home visits/discussion groups; or computerized appointment-tracking system. Participants are representative of the surrounding, predominantly low-income minority community and are treated in a hospital-based clinic and in a private clinic in the community. About 65% have blood pressure levels considered to be out of control. It was concluded that structural changes at the clinic site, along with the targeted interventions, would improve patient satisfaction, increase treatment adherence, and improve blood pressure control.

TI  - Implications of a health lifestyle and medication analysis for improving hypertension control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: National Health and Nutritional Examination surveys have documented poor rates of hypertension treatment and control, leading to preventable morbidity and mortality.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine covariation in the medication and health lifestyle beliefs and behaviors of persons with hypertension to identify and profile distinct subgroups of patients.
AB  - METHODS: A sample of 727 patients with hypertension, weighted to match the 1992 National Health Interview Survey age and sex distribution of patients with hypertension, was interviewed by telephone about their beliefs and behaviors regarding hypertension and its management. Cluster analysis of key variables was used to identify 4 patient types.
AB  - RESULTS: Subgroups differed significantly. Group A members use an effective mix of medication and health lifestyle regimens to control blood pressure. Group B members are most likely to depend on medication and have high adherence rates. Yet they also have high rates of smoking (29%) and alcohol use (average, 104 times per year) and are less likely to exercise regularly. Group C members are most likely to forget to take medication, are likely to be obese, and find it most difficult to comply with lifestyle changes (except for very low rates of smoking and alcohol use). Group D members are least likely to take medication, most likely to change or stop medication without consulting their physician (20%), most likely to smoke (40%), and least likely to control diet (29%). Group A and B members have better health outcomes than group C and D members.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Optimal management strategies are likely to differ for the 4 patient types. Further research should be conducted to validate these findings on a separate sample and to devise and test tailored management algorithms for hypertension compliance and control.

TI  - A design for testing interventions to improve adherence within a hypertension clinical trial.
AB  - The Potassium Adherence Clinical Trial (PACT) incorporates one randomized clinical trial within another. A randomized trial of interventions to increase adherence to medication is nested within a second randomized clinical trial testing hypotensive effect of supplemental oral potassium. The trial aims principally to compare the effects of three intervention strategies: two sessions of individual patient counseling, two telephone contacts, or standard care. The trial aims secondarily to evaluate the effect of 60 mEq supplemental oral potassium daily on sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients on established drug therapy. Therefore, it organizes the patients given potassium into three study groups for adherence interventions, and the patients assigned to placebo into a further three. We evaluate adherence primarily by means of the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), an electronic system that records the date and time that the container of study medication is opened. Additional measurements, such as assessments of change in levels of urinary potassium, pill counts, appointment records, self-reporting by patients, and estimates by physician of adherence, are used and correlated with MEMS data. At a single center, the trial enrolled 107 participants between the ages of 26 and 80. This paper describes the background to this trial within a trial, details its design, documents the baseline characteristics of participants enrolled, and describes issues experienced during implementation of the trial.

TI  - Stress management intervention for primary prevention of hypertension: detailed results from Phase I of Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP-I).
AB  - PURPOSE: Stress Management Intervention (SMI) was one of seven nonpharmacologic approaches evaluated in Phase I Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP-I) for efficacy in lowering diastolic blood pressure (BP) in healthy men and women aged 30 to 54 years with diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 242 and 320 participants were randomized to SMI or an "assessment only" SMI Control, respectively, at four clinical centers. The SMI consisted of 37 contact hours in 21 group and two individual meetings over 18 months and included: training in four relaxation methods, techniques to reduce stress reactions, cognitive approaches, communication skills, time management, and anger management within a general problem-solving format. Standardized protocols detailed methods and timing for collecting BP, psychosocial measures, and urinary samples from both SMI and SMI Control participants.
AB  - RESULTS: In intention-to-treat analyses, although significant baseline to termination BP reductions were observed in both groups, net differences between the SMI and SMI Control groups' BP changes (mean (95% CI)) were not significant: -0.82 (-1.86, 0.22) for diastolic BP, and -0.47 (-1.96, 1.01) for systolic BP. Extensive adherence sub-group analyses found one effect: a significant 1.36 mm Hg (p = 0.01) reduction in diastolic BP relative to SMI Controls at the end of the trial for SMI participants who completed 61% or more of intervention sessions.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: While the TOHP-I SMI was acceptable to participants as evident from high levels of session completion, the absence of demonstrated BP lowering efficacy in intention-to-treat analyses suggests that the TOHP-I SMI is an unlikely candidate for primary prevention of hypertension in a general population sample similar to study participants. The isolated finding of significant diastolic BP lowering in SMI participants with higher adherence provides very weak evidence of SMI BP lowering efficacy and may be a chance finding. Whether similar or other stress management interventions can produce significant BP lowering in populations selected for higher levels of BP, stress, or intervention adherence remains to be demonstrated.

TI  - Dietary adherence in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial. DASH Collaborative Research Group.
AB  - Participants in controlled feeding studies must consume all study foods and abstain from all other foods. In outpatient studies in which adherence may be compromised by free-living conditions, promoting, documenting, and monitoring dietary adherence are necessary. In the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial, a thorough participant screening process, an orientation session, and a run-in feeding period before randomization aided in the selection of participants who would most likely adhere to the demands of the study protocol. Throughout the feeding period, various educational and motivational techniques were used to encourage DASH participants to adhere to the dietary protocol. Both objective and subjective methods documented excellent participant adherence. Daily monitoring of individual adherence was based on meal attendance, body weight measurements, and daily diaries. Urinary sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and urea nitrogen values and an anonymous poststudy survey were used to evaluate adherence at the end of the study. Most DASH participants adhered to the feeding regimen by consuming only study foods and no other foods. When adherence lapsed, participants generally cited the lack of menu variety as a reason. Successful participant adherence to the constraints of an outpatient controlled feeding study is possible with carefully selected participants and a variety of adherence-promoting strategies incorporated into the study protocol.

TI  - Propranolol in prevention of portal hypertensive hemorrhage in children: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data regarding the use of propranolol in the prevention of portal hypertensive hemorrhage in pediatric patients are limited despite its widespread use in adults with cirrhosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of propranolol in the management of portal hypertension in the pediatric population.
AB  - METHODS: Medical information was retrieved from the records of 21 children with portal hypertension who received propranolol either before or after an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding. Data collected included diagnosis, type of portal hypertension, age at initiation of therapy, bleeding episodes before and during propranolol therapy, degree of reduction of heart rate, adherence, and adverse effects.
AB  - RESULTS: Fourteen of 21 patients did not experience portal hypertensive bleeding while receiving propranolol. Of the seven patients who had bleeding episodes, two had failed to adhere to the medication regimen, and four were receiving doses of less than 1 mg/kg per day. Only one of the four patients who experienced bleeding before initiation of therapy also bled while receiving propranolol, and two of the three patients who had a heart rate reduction of less than 25% each experienced a bleeding episode. Side effects were minimal and did not necessitate discontinuation of therapy in any patient.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Propranolol was well tolerated with minimal side effects in our patients with portal hypertension. Adherence and adequacy of dosage (>1 mg/kg per day, more than twice daily dose frequency) are important determinants of efficacy. A reduction in heart rate of less than 25% may be associated with suboptimal efficacy.

TI  - The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) clinical trial: implications for lifestyle modifications in the treatment of hypertensive patients.
AB  - Lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss, sodium restriction, and limiting alcohol consumption, are important components of the initial treatment of hypertensive patients. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study investigated the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure in individuals with diastolic blood pressure between 80-95 mmHg. Two different dietary patterns were tested in this feeding study. A diet enriched in fruits and vegetables and a diet enriched in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and low in total and saturated fat (combination diet) were compared with a control diet. Dietary intake was adjusted so that participants did not lose weight, and all study diets had comparable sodium intake (approximately 3 grams/day). All meals were provided for 459 participants for an 11-week period. Those randomized to the combination diet (n = 151) had a significant change in systolic (-5.5 mmHg; p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (-3.0 mmHg; p < 0.001) after subtracting the response to the control diet (n = 154). The fruits-and-vegetables diet (n = 154) produced a significant but lesser decrease in blood pressure (systolic, -2.8 mmHg; p < 0.001 and diastolic, -1.1 mmHg; p = 0.07). Hypertensive individuals and African Americans had particularly favorable responses with blood pressure reductions, which were significantly greater than other subgroups. The combination diet was well-accepted and adherence to the diet was high (>90%) for all participants. The DASH combination diet is an effective lifestyle modification for lowering blood pressure in patients with high-normal or Stage 1 hypertension.

TI  - Using administrative data to compare the relative effectiveness of amlodipine vs nifedipine CC.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe an approach for using claims data to compare the effectiveness of 2 similar drugs used for similar indications within a health maintenance organization.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A database study comparing the effectiveness of amlodipine and nifedipine CC in the initial treatment of hypertension.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: The claims records of Pennsylvania Medicaid patients between 18 and 64 years of age with continuous eligibility in 1994 were studied. Pharmacy, hospital, and outpatient claims data were merged, and adult patients receiving the target drugs for the specified indication were identified. The effectiveness of the 2 agents used were compared based on the concept that a change in dispensed medication suggested either an adverse event or lack of effectiveness. Adherence rates, adverse events, and pharmacy and nonpharmacy costs associated with the 2 agents were also compared.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients receiving amlodipine and nifedipine CC as initial treatment for hypertension had similar demographic characteristics and numbers of comorbid conditions. More patients started on nifedipine CC switched to another calcium channel blocker (15.8% for nifedipine CC vs 10.3% for amlodipine). More patients started on amlodipine switched to another class of antihypertensive agent (13.2% for amlodipine vs 7.3% for nifedipine CC). Patients in both groups received adjunctive antihypertensive drugs at a similar frequency (35% for nifedipine CC vs 42%, for amlodipine). Rates of adherence were similar. In adherent patients, there was no difference in rates of reported adverse events. The nonpharmacy costs were similar between groups. Patients in the amlodipine group also had a trend toward higher overall pharmacy charges (all medications) and higher charges for antihypertensive medications other than the study drugs ($302 vs $188, P = .054).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Claims data are often the best available evidence for comparing the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals in real clinical practice. While these comparisons have inherent limitations, the accuracy of the assessment can be maximized by limiting the assessment to agents with the same specific indications. Other important elements include comparison of crossover rates to other pharmaceuticals in the same class; rates of addition of other pharmaceuticals in the same class, adherence, adverse events, and overall healthcare charges.

TI  - [The role of home pressure monitoring in the treatment hypertension in the practice of general medicine]. [Czech]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to evaluate home blood pressure (BP) measurement using an OMRON HEM 706 device (including printout values) for the treatment of essential hypertension by a greater number of general practitioners and to establish the incidence of "white coat hypertension".
AB  - METHODS: We compared home BP values, taken by the portable digital Omron HEM 706 device with casual BP values, measured during the course of a 6-month treatment of essential hypertension by the ACE inhibitor perindopril or a combination of perindopril and a diuretic (most frequently a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide) in 503 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Czech and Slovak general practitioners participated in the study. Home BP measurement was performed by the patients always during the 4 days preceding the visit by the general practitioner. Home BP was measured twice daily, "trough" and "peak" values (in the morning before the use of drug and then between noon and 2.00 p.m.), each time twice. The OMRON device enables to print out the measured values. Casual hypertension was defined as casual BP 140/90 mmHg and higher, "home hypertension" was defined as a mean BP higher than 130/85 mm Hg from 8 home BP measurements performed during the last 2 days before the visit by the general practitioner higher than 130/85 mmHg.
AB  - RESULTS: A significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic BP occurred during the treatment by perindopril or the combination of perindopril and a diuretic. The decrease in BP was observed both in the casual BP values and in the home BP values. Normalisation of the casual diastolic BP (diastolic BP lower than 90 mmHg) occurred in 59.3% of the patients after the first month of treatment, in 75.4% of the patients after 3 months of treatment, and in 78.5% of patients after 6 months of treatment. Only 2.1% of patients dropped out from the study due to side effects. These data demonstrated a very good efficacy and tolerance of perindopril. Only 62.6% of general practitioners showing interest in home BP measurement at the informative meetings joined the study and 14-19% of patients of the whole studied group did not use home BP at all. In general the interest of general practitioners and their patients observed in this study was less than that observed among the cardiologists in our previous study. The incidence of the "white coat phenomenon" was related to its definition, it increased when using a less strict definition and decreased during the course of therapy, in parallel to the normalisation of BP. Home BP values were significantly higher during the first 2 day of measurement then during the last 2 days of measurement (of the 4-days period). "White coat hypertension" could be observed in 9.4% of the group during the study. Home BP measurement also enabled to disclose "white coat normotension" defined as normal casual BP values and hypertensive home BP values. "White coat normotension" occurred at the end of the study in 26.3% of the patients. This relatively high number of patients with "white coat normotension" could be partly due to a short period of rest at home before taking home BP values.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Home BP measurement was positively evaluated both by the general practitioners and patients. Home BP measurement provides better information about the efficacy of hypertension treatment and discloses "overtreatment" ("white coat hypertension") as well "undertreatment" ("white coat normotension"). It also increases the adherence of patients to the treatment of essential hypertension. The interest in home BP measuring was, however, less among the general practitioners and their patients than among the cardiologists and their patients (observed in a previous study).

TI  - Clinical practice guidelines in unstable angina improve clinical outcomes by assuring early intensive medical treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the influence of clinical practice guidelines on treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in unstable angina and the effectiveness of guideline reminders on implementing practice guidelines, two groups of medium and high risk patients with unstable angina were compared.
AB  - BACKGROUND: New guidelines have been published by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) for evaluating and managing patients with unstable angina. The impact of these guidelines to improve the quality of care has never been tested.
AB  - METHODS: Group 1 included 338 consecutive medium or high risk patients admitted before publication of the AHCPR guidelines, and group 2 consisted of 181 consecutive similar risk patients admitted after institution of the AHCPR guideline reminders at this institution. Dissemination of clinical practice guidelines was ensured by a grand rounds lecture and by posting guideline reminders on all group 2 patients' charts within 24 h of admission.
AB  - RESULTS: The two groups were similar in terms of most baseline characteristics, including hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hypertension, smoking history, baseline ST segment depression and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Group 1 patients were older (68+/-13 vs. 63+/-16 years, p = 0.001) and more frequently had a previous myocardial infarction (39% vs. 22%, p = 0.001). Group 2 patients more frequently required intravenous nitroglycerin to control the index episode of chest pain (43% vs. 34%, p = 0.003). Group 2 patients more frequently received aspirin (96% vs. 88%, p = 0.009) during admission and underwent coronary angiography (71% vs. 58%, p = 0.006). More importantly, group 2 patients received oral beta-blockers (p = 0.008), aspirin and coronary angiography (p = 0.001) earlier than group 1 patients and experienced recurrent angina (29% vs. 54%) and myocardial infarction or death less frequently (3% vs. 9%, p = 0.028).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In unstable angina, clinical practice guidelines were associated with greater use of aspirin and coronary angiography and greater use and earlier administration of beta-blockers. Variation in drug use over time was also reduced. Objective improvement in clinical outcome was also noted. Thus, practice guidelines improve the quality of care of patients with unstable angina.

TI  - Adherence to the salt restriction diet among people with mildly elevated blood pressure.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the adherence to a salt restriction diet and the effect of salt restriction on blood pressure in free living subjects with mildly elevated blood pressure.
AB  - DESIGN: Subjects with mildly elevated blood pressure participated in a controlled study on the effect of salt restriction on blood pressure. Subjects received oral and written instructions by a clinical nutritionist to reduce sodium chloride intake to five grams per day. A low sodium bread (0.5%) was supplied free of charge for the subjects during the whole low-sodium period (between weeks 4-24).
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were recruited from previous studies at the Kuopio Research Institute of Exercise Medicine and from local occupational health care services. Twenty-four men and 15 women aged 28-65 y with the mean daytime ambulatory diastolic blood pressure between 90-105 mmHg and office diastolic blood pressure between 95-115 mmHg were included in the study. Salt intake was monitored by 4-d food diaries and 24-h urinary sodium excretion.
AB  - RESULTS: Twenty percent of the subjects achieved a urinary sodium excretion level of less than 74 mmol/24 h corresponding to a salt intake of five grams per day. There was a significant decline (7.1+/-12.7/4.2+/-7.5) in systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels during the salt restriction diet.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Even moderate salt restriction seems to be effective in the treatment of mildly elevated blood pressure. However, the recommended salt intake level of less than five grams per day is difficult to achieve even after intensive counselling and regular use of low salt bread.

TI  - Implementing clinical guidelines in the treatment of hypertension in general practice.
AB  - Discrepancies between clinical guidelines and clinical practice call for practical implementation strategies. This study evaluates the implementation of clinical guidelines for hypertension in general practice with a specific computer-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) as part of the intervention. We carried out a randomized study of general practice health centres in Sor- and Nord-Trondelag counties in Norway (population 380000). A total of 17 health centres were included, with 24 doctors and 984 patients in the intervention group. Data from 887 patients was used in the analyses. There were 12 health centres with 29 doctors and 1255 patients in the control group. Data from 1127 control patients was used in the analyses. The main outcome measures were doctor's behaviour, measured by adherence to registration of recommended variables in the Norwegian clinical guidelines for hypertension. The aim of the intervention was to lower the fractions of patients without registrations. However, there were no clinically significant differences between the intervention group and the control group for fractions of patients without registration of blood pressure (intervention group 14.3%, control group 14.2%) or serum cholesterol (62.3% vs. 56.8%) during 12 months, nor, during 18 months, for fractions of patients without a registration of cigarette smoking (82.9% vs. 87.1%), cardiovascular inheritance (79.5% vs. 73.4%) and body mass index (81.5% vs. 89.2%). One or several variables necessary for calculation of risk score for myocardial infarction were missing in 91.7% of patients in the intervention group and 91.9% of patients in the control group. Large centre variations were shown for all variables. Implementation of clinical guidelines in the treatment of hypertensive patients in general practice, by means of a CDSS and several procedures for implementation did not result in clinically significant changes in the doctors' behaviour. Of importance are both the lack of user-friendliness of the specific CDSS and problems in performing time-consuming multidimensional procedures.

TI  - Patients' and physicians' assessment of risks associated with hypertension and benefits from treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perceptions of effects of a medical regimen may affect patients' adherence to therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess concordance between patients' and physicians' estimations of the risks of hypertension and benefits of treatment during a regular follow-up appointment.
AB  - DESIGN: A population-based Swedish multicentre study. Patients were included consecutively from a randomized selection of centres (55 primary health care centres and 11 clinics of internal medicine).
AB  - METHODS: A questionnaire was given to 1013 patients undergoing their individually prescribed antihypertensive therapy and 212 physicians who were caring for these patients.
AB  - RESULTS: Without therapy, patients perceived the risks of cardiovascular complications to be higher than did their physicians. Patients were not aware that an increasing number of risk factors has an impact on the risk of complications. Patients furthermore rated the benefits of treatment higher than did their physicians (P<0.001). Of the patients, 14% had blood pressures < or = 140/90 mmHg. Most of the patients (61%) were not aware of their target blood pressure. However, when the target pressure was communicated to patients by the physician, patients remembered it accurately. The patients were generally not willing to trade even minor side effects from antihypertensive therapy for benefits of treatment.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There was a high degree of inconsistency between patients' and physicians' estimations of risks of hypertension. Patients estimated the effects of treatment to be more beneficial than did their physicians.

TI  - Coronary risk reduction through intensive community-based lifestyle intervention: the Coronary Health Improvement Project (CHIP) experience.
AB  - Vigorous cholesterol lowering with diet, drugs, or a combination has been shown to slow, arrest, or even reverse atherosclerosis. Residential lifestyle intervention programs have successfully lowered serum cholesterol levels and other coronary risk factors, but they have the disadvantages of high cost and difficulty with long-term adherence. Community-based risk-reduction programs have the potential to effect change at low cost and improve long-term adherence. To assess the effectiveness of, and to develop a model for, such programs, the community-based Coronary Health Improvement Project (CHIP) was developed in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In the intensive (30-day, 40-hour), hospital-based educational program, participants are encouraged to exercise 30 minutes a day and to embrace a largely unrefined plant-food-centered diet that is high in complex carbohydrates and fiber; very low in fat, animal protein, sugar, and salt; and virtually free of cholesterol. A total of 304 enrollees in the first program were at elevated risk of coronary artery and related diseases: 70% were > or =10% above their ideal weight, 14% had diabetes, 47% had hypertension, and 32% had a history of coronary artery disease. Of the enrollees, 288 "graduated" from the program (123 men, 165 women; mean age was 55+/-11 years). Various markers of disease risk, including serum blood lipids and fasting blood glucose concentrations, were measured before and after the program. At 4 weeks, overall improvements in the participants' laboratory test results, blood pressures, weights, and body mass indexes were highly significant (p <0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased significantly (p <0.05) in participants who had elevated triglyceride levels (>200 mg/dL in men, 200-299 mg/dL in women).

TI  - Characteristics of 9194 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: the LIFE study. Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension.
AB  - -Losartan was the first available orally administered selective antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint (LIFE) Reduction in Hypertension Study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of losartan with those of the beta-blocker atenolol on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Patients with essential hypertension, aged between 55 and 80 years, and ECG-documented left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were included. Altogether, 9223 patients in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the United States were randomized from June 1995 through April 1997, and 9194 remain after exclusion of a study center at which irregularities were discovered. This population of hypertensives (mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure, 174.4/97.8 mm Hg) with LVH comprises women (54.1%) and men, mostly retired from active work (mean age, 66.9 years), with a high prevalence of overweight (mean body mass index, 28.0 kg/m2), diabetes mellitus (12.3%), lipid disorders (18.0%), and symptoms or signs of coronary heart disease (15.1%). There were fewer current smokers (<17%) than in the general population, and approximately 7% were nonwhite. Almost 30% of participants had been untreated for at least 6 months when screened for the study. Only 1557 persons who entered the placebo run-in period of 14 days were excluded, predominantly because of sitting blood pressures above or below the predetermined range of 160-200/95-115 mm Hg and ECG-LVH criteria not met. By application of simple 12-lead ECG criteria for LVH (Cornell voltage QRS duration product formula plus Sokolow-Lyon voltage read by a core laboratory), hypertensive patients with LVH with an average 5-year coronary heart disease risk of 22.3% according to the Framingham score were identified. This population is now being treated (goal, <140/90 mm Hg) in adherence with the protocol for at least 4 years after final enrollment (ie, through April 2001) and until at least 1040 patients suffer myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death.

TI  - Attitudes of primary care providers toward diabetes: barriers to guideline implementation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Primary care providers have been slow to adopt standards of care for diabetes, and continuing medical education (CME) programs have been minimally effective in changing provider behavior. The objective of this study was to explore the previously reported finding that attitudes, rather than knowledge, may impede primary care provider adherence to standards of care.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Study participants included 31 primary care providers attending an eight-session CME program on diabetes. Providers rated on a 10-point scale how the treatment of diabetes compared with that of five other chronic conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, angina, arthritis, and heart failure; 1 = easier to 10 = harder; midpoint 5.5). In a subsequent open-ended qualitative interview, providers explained their scale ratings.
AB  - RESULTS: Diabetes was rated as significantly harder to treat than hypertension (24 of 30 >5.5; P < 0.001) and angina (20 of 30 >5.5; P = 0.03). A majority also rated hyperlipidemia (18 of 30) and arthritis (18 of 30) as easier to treat than diabetes. Explanatory themes underlying provider frustrations with diabetes include characteristics of the disease itself and the complexity of its management, and a perceived lack of support from society and the health care system for their efforts to control diabetes.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: CME that addresses provider attitudes toward diabetes in addition to updating knowledge may be more effective than traditional CME in promoting adherence to standards of care. Additional changes are needed in our health care system to shift from an acute to a chronic disease model to effectively support diabetes care efforts.

TI  - Automated telephone conversations to assess health behavior and deliver behavioral interventions.
AB  - The medical care system is not very effective in modifying health behavior of individuals, in particular, ensuring patient compliance with medication regimens, healthy diets, regular physical activity, and regular health screening, and in the avoidance of substance abuse. Telephone-Linked Care (TLC) is a telecommunications technology that enables computer-controlled telephone counseling with patients in their homes. It has been applied to the task of improving a number of different health behaviors. Randomized controlled studies suggest that use of the system for as little as 3 months is associated with improvement in adherence to medication regimens, dietary change in hypercholesterolemia, and increased physical activity among sedentary individuals. Future work involves applying the technology to other important health behaviors, optimally using health behavior theory in the system design, targeting use of TLC to the most appropriate patient groups, incorporating new computer and telecommunications technology into the system, and interfacing TLC into the health care delivery system.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of CQI teams and academic detailing: can they alter compliance with guidelines?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The availability of clinical guidelines in isolation has generally failed to promote voluntary change in practice patterns. Accordingly, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of academic detailing (AD) techniques and continuous quality improvement (CQI) teams in increasing compliance with national guidelines for the primary care of hypertension and depression.
AB  - METHODS: Fifteen small group practices at four Seattle primary care clinics were assigned to one of three study arms--AD alone, AD plus CQI teams, or usual care. The activity of 95 providers and 4,995 patients was monitored from August 1, 1993, through January 31, 1996. Twelve-month baseline and study periods were separated by a six-month "wash-in" period during which training sessions were held. Changes in hypertension prescribing, blood pressure control, depression recognition, use of older tricyclics, and scores on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression scale were examined.
AB  - RESULTS: Clinics varied considerably in their implementation of both the AD and the CQI team interventions. Across all sites, AD was associated with change in a single process measure, a decline in the percentage of depressives prescribed first-generation tricyclics (-4.7 percentage points versus control, p = 0.04). No intervention effects were demonstrated for CQI teams across all sites for either disease condition. Within the clinic independently judged most successful at implementing both change strategies, the use of CQI teams and AD in combination did increase the percentage of hypertensives adequately controlled (17.3 percentage points versus control, p = 0.03).
AB  - SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: The AD techniques and the CQI teams evaluated were generally ineffective in improving guideline compliance and clinical outcomes regarding the primary care of hypertension and depression.

TI  - [Race, compliance to treatment and/or consultation and control of arterial hypertension]. [Portuguese]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare racial differences on hypertension (Hy) control and compliance to appointments and/or treatment.
AB  - METHODS: Between November/94 to January/95, 200 low social strata hypertensive outpatients were interviewed (cross-sectional clinical-epidemiologic study) and had their blood-pressure measured (double-blind) in Salvador, Brazil. Compliance to treatment criteria: > or = 50% appointments/year; compliance to treatment = Hy control-WHO and NIH criteria. Means, frequency ratios (FR) and chi 2 were used in the analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Most of the hypertensives (88%) were women. Race: 45.5% were mulatoes (M) and 40.5% blacks (B). Compliance to appointments and treatment (A + T) was 30.5%, to treatment (T) 11%, to appointments, 37%, and noncompliance = 21.5%. Compliance was 53.6% for whites (W) and 19.7% for B (p < 0.001); 40% of hypertensives were controlled by WHO criteria and 24% by the NIH (p < 0.001). Frequency ratios for SBP, NIH criteria: W/B = 2.9, W/M = 2.6; WHO: W/B and B/M = 1.7 and for DBP, NIH criteria: W/B = 1.6, W/M = 1.9 and WHO = W/B and W/M = 1.4. Main reason for compliance = Hy control; main reason for noncompliance forgetting the appointment date and/or disease in the appointment day.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Compliance to appointment did not seem an advantage for treatment adherence and the results pointed out some characteristics of patients that need special attention to improve appointments and treatment compliance.

TI  - A computerized intervention to decrease the use of calcium channel blockers in hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a computer-assisted reminder would alter prescribing habits for the treatment of hypertension in accordance with current clinical guidelines in a general internal medicine clinic.
AB  - DESIGN: A randomized trial.
AB  - SETTING: The General Internal Medicine Clinic of the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle Division.
AB  - PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Clinic providers were randomized to a control group (n = 35) or intervention group (n = 36). We targeted the providers of patients being treated for hypertension with calcium channel blockers, a class of drug not recommended for initial therapy.
AB  - INTERVENTION: An automated computer query identified eligible patients and their providers. A guideline reminder was placed in the charts of patients of intervention providers; the charts of patients of control providers received no reminder.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the 5-month study period, 346 patients were seen by the 36 primary care providers (staff physicians, nurse practitioners, residents, and fellows) in the intervention group, and 373 patients were seen by the 35 providers in the control group. Intervention providers changed 39 patients (11.3%) to other medications during the study period, compared with 1 patient (<1.0%) of control providers (p < .0001). For patients whose therapy was unchanged, providers noted angina in 23.1%, indications other than those for hypertension in 9.5%, intolerable adverse effects with first-line therapy in 13.9%, and inadequate control with first-line therapy in 13.9%. Of those patients without provider-indicated contraindications, 23.6% were switched from calcium channel blockers to first-line agents during the intervention period.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The use of a computerized, clinic-based intervention increased compliance with guidelines in the treatment of primary hypertension in general, and decreased the use of calcium channel blockers for the treatment of hypertension in particular.

TI  - [Clinical effectiveness of and tolerance to ramipril in the treatment of essential arterial hypertension phase 1 and 2. Results of a multicenter study]. [Spanish]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last two decades, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have become first line medications in the treatment of hypertension.
AB  - AIM: To assess the tolerance and effectiveness of ramipril as monotherapy in the treatment of essential hypertension.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty eight hypertensive patients, aged 21 to 80 years-old, coming from 4 Chilean hospitals were studied. Using an open non controlled design; they were treated with placebo for two weeks and with the active drug during eight weeks, in initial doses of 2.5 mg/day that were adjusted to 5 mg/day if diastolic blood pressure did not drop below 90 mm Hg or if its reduction was less than 10 mm Hg.
AB  - RESULTS: During the active drug treatment period, systolic blood pressure decreased from 164.8 +/- 7.2 to 147.3 +/- 4.8 mm Hg. Diastolic blood pressure dropped from 102.3 +/- 3.1 to 87.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg. Seventy percent of patients achieved a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg, 56.9% with 2.5 mg/day and 13.8% with 5 mg/day. Dizziness, cough and headache were the main adverse reactions, observed in 3.7, 3.2 and 2.1% of patients respectively. Adherence to treatment was 98%. There were no changes in laboratory values during the treatment period.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Ramipril is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of essential hypertension.

TI  - Effect of transfusion on physiologic changes after resuscitated trauma.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this experimental study was to test whether transfusion potentiated physiologic changes associated with fluid resuscitated trauma in controlled conditions.
AB  - METHODS: Anesthetized and ventilated mongrel pigs were subjected to soft-tissue injury plus 35% hemorrhage and 1 hour shock and then were resuscitated with either autologous (shed) or heterologous (cross-transfused) fresh whole blood. Leukocyte differential counts, T-lymphocyte subsets, neutrophil adherence molecule (CD18) expression, granulocyte oxidative burst, plasma cortisol, and serum chemistries were monitored in awake animals with indwelling catheters on 3 consecutive days. Changes were referenced to preinjury baseline values and to a control group that received heterologous transfusion but no shock. To determine whether these changes might have influenced host defense, a low-dose challenge with Escherichia coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]; 1 to 2 micrograms/kg for 30 minutes) was administered on day 4.
AB  - RESULTS: During recovery, neutrophil counts, neutrophil CD18 expression, and granulocyte oxidative burst were generally increased, but the changes were not potentiated by transfusion. Lymphocyte subpopulations remained relatively constant. Serum enzyme markers were elevated with trauma plus shed blood or trauma plus cross-transfusion, but they remained essentially unchanged after heterologous transfusion only. Plasma cortisol, a nonspecific index of stress, peaked at 3 to 6 times higher than baseline. The increases tended to be higher and later with heterologous transfusion only, relative to trauma plus shed blood or trauma plus cross-transfusion. The delayed LPS challenge evoked profound but transient pulmonary hypertension and leukopenia, followed by subsequent hypoxemia; the time courses and magnitude of these changes were similar in all groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: If these measured variables before and after LPS challenge are a valid index of host defense in this species, then a 35% transfusion does not potentiate the risk for posttrauma immune dysfunction when the magnitude of injury is constant. Thus the predisposition to infection after human trauma might be due to cold storage of blood; separation of blood into components, or other transfusion-related practices rather than to transfusion per se.

TI  - Combination treatment in hypertension: the VeraTran Study. [Review] [18 refs]
AB  - In the past few years, the combination of two antihypertensive drugs has become a popular approach to hypertension treatment, because this procedure allows one to obtain satisfactory blood pressure control when monotherapy is partially ineffective and also to improve a patient's adherence to the therapeutic regimen, thereby enhancing the tolerance/effectiveness ratio of the treatment. This paper will briefly review the theoretical background and the requirements for an effective combination treatment. It will also discuss the results of the VeraTran Study, a multicenter study performed according to a double-blind parallel group design and aimed at assessing the antihypertensive efficacy of the fixed combination verapamil slow release (SR) and trandolapril, administered for 8 weeks, on clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure. The results of the study demonstrate that the fixed combination of a calcium antagonist and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor allows one to obtain an effective and balanced blood pressure control throughout the 24 h.

TI  - Adherence to National Cholesterol Education Program Treatment goals in postmenopausal women with heart disease. The Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS). The HERS Research Group.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of volunteer women with established heart disease who have low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels at or below the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel goals and to determine what factors are associated with levels above goal or not receiving lipid-lowering medication when indicated.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional measurement of lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure, height, weight, and other demographic and cardiovascular risk factors in 2763 postmenopausal women with heart disease.
AB  - SETTING: At 18 centers throughout the United States, participants were recruited by means of lists of women with coronary heart disease from coronary units and catheterization laboratories, direct mail to age-eligible women, and advertisements.
AB  - PATIENTS: Mean age of the cohort was 66.7 years (range, 44-79 years) and the distribution by race/ethnicity was 88.7% white, 7.9% African American, 2.0% Hispanic/Latina, 0.8% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 0.7% other.
AB  - INTERVENTION: We report cross-sectional analysis of the cohort at baseline.
AB  - OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured the frequency of achieving 1988 and 1993 Adult Treatment Panel treatment goals, and of being on a regimen of lipid-lowering medication.
AB  - RESULTS: Although 47% of participants were taking a lipid-lowering medication, 63% did not meet the 1988 treatment goal of LDL-C level less than 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) and 91% did not meet the 1993 goal of LDL-C level less than 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). Factors independently associated with achieving the earlier goal were use of lipid-lowering medication, marital status, education, body mass index, exercise, hypertension, diabetes, gallbladder disease, and first diagnosis of coronary heart disease after 1990. Failure to use lipid-lowering medication was associated with age, being African American, marital status, body mass index, lack of exercise, alcohol consumption, current smoking, and first diagnosis of coronary heart disease before 1985.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The majority of women enrolled in the trial had LDL-C levels that significantly exceeded the treatment goals set by the 1988 and 1993 Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. Better implementation of these guidelines among women with coronary disease would be highly desirable.

Nutrition and cardiovascular scientists and food technologists collaborated to develop a prepared meal plan that meets national dietary guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effects of this plan, which incorporates all National Academy of Sciences National Research Council recommended dietary allowances for vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients, compared with a patient-selected American Heart Association Step I and Step II diet plan.
AB  - METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, parallel-intervention trial was conducted at 10 medical centers in the United States and Canada and involved 560 men and women with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes. Following calculation of prescriptions to meet individual nutritional requirements based on the Harris-Benedict equation, participants were randomized to the Campbell's Center for Nutrition and Wellness (CCNW) plan, which is composed of prepackaged breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals provided to participants, or a nutritionist-guided American Heart Association Step I and Step II diet, in which participants self-selected foods to meet their nutrition prescription for 10 weeks.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure (BP); lipid, glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and insulin levels; body weight; dietary intake; and quality of life.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients' BP, lipid levels, carbohydrate metabolism, weight, and quality of life (P < or = .001 for all findings except low-density lipoprotein-high-density lipoprotein ratio, P = .25) all improved on both nutrition plans. Mean differences (+/-SD) between baseline and treatment clinical values for the CCNW and the self-selected diet groups (between-group P values), respectively, were as follows: systolic BP, -6.4 +/- 9.2 mm Hg and -4.6 +/- 9.0 mm Hg (P = .02); diastolic BP, -4.2 +/- 5.7 mm Hg and -3.0 +/- 5.1 mm Hg (P = .006); cholesterol, -0.32 +/- 0.58 mmol/L and -0.27 +/- 0.56 mmol/L (-12.4 +/- 22.5 mg/dL and -10.4 +/- 21.9 mg/dL) (P = .30); glucose, -0.65 +/- 1.88 mmol/L and -0.75 +/- 2.03 mmol/L (-11.7 +/- 34.0 mg/dL and -13.5 +/- 36.6 mg/dL) (P = .10); and HbA1c, -0.4% +/- 0.8% and -0.3% +/- 0.7% (P = .66). Weight loss with the CCNW and self-selected plans, respectively, was as follows: men, -4.5 +/- 3.6 kg and -3.5 +/- 3.3 kg; and women, -4.8 +/- 3.0 kg and -2.8 +/- 2.8 kg. Quality of life was significantly improved for daily and work activities (P < .05) and nutritional health perceptions (P < .05) with the CCNW plan relative to the self-selected group. Overall nutrient intake and compliance were both significantly (P < .001) better with the CCNW plan.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Nutritionally balanced meals that meet the recommendations of national health organizations improved multiple risk factors for patients with cardiovascular disease. The CCNW plan resulted in greater clinical benefits, nutritional completeness, and compliance than the self-selected diet. The CCNW is a comprehensive nutrition plan, convenient for both prescription and practice, and appears viable for effecting favorable dietary changes in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Appointment attendance, pill counts, and achievement of goal blood pressure in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Pilot Study.
AB  - The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study evaluated the feasibility of conducting a 7-year clinical trial to assess the effect of two levels of blood pressure control based on mean arterial pressure (MAP) (low goal < or = 92 mm Hg or usual goal of 102-107 mm Hg) and three antihypertensive drug regimens (atenolol, amlodipine, or enalapril) as initial therapy in slowing the decline of renal function in African Americans with clinically diagnosed hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Ninety-four African American men and women between 18 and 70 years of age were randomized and followed for an average of 4.6 months. On average participants attended 87.5% of the scheduled monthly follow-up visits and achieved an acceptable level of medication adherence (80%-100% of prescribed doses by pill count) at 65.4% of those visits Blood pressure levels within goal were observed in 17.5% and 25.6% of the participants in the low- and usual MAP goal groups, respectively. Neither attendance nor medication adherence by pill count was associated with attainment of goal blood pressure. Although AASK Pilot Study participants maintained excellent attendance, their pill counts were lower than previously reported among clinical trial participants and goal blood pressure levels were difficult to achieve during the short period of follow-up.

TI  - Design and baseline characteristics of participants in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study.
AB  - Hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, especially among African Americans. The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study evaluated the feasibility of conducting a long-term clinical trial to compare the effects of two levels of blood pressure control and three different antihypertensive drug regimens on the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in African Americans with clinically diagnosed hypertensive renal disease. African American men and women aged 18-70 years with a GFR of 25-70 ml/min/ 1.73m2 and hypertension were randomized in a 3 x 2 factorial design to initial treatment with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), or a beta blocker (atenolol) and to a mean arterial blood pressure (goal MAP) of either 102-107 mm Hg or < or = 92 mm Hg. Furosemide, doxazosin, clonidine, hydralazine, and minoxidil were added sequentially until goal MAP was achieved. To compare the pathologic diagnosis with the clinical diagnosis of renal disease, study participants without contraindication were also asked to undergo a renal biopsy. The goals of the AASK Pilot Study were to evaluate recruitment techniques, adherence to prescribed antihypertensive drug regimens, ability of the antihypertensive regimens to achieve blood pressure goals, rates of participation in scheduled clinic visits and procedures, and variability of GFR measurements. A further goal was to obtain renal biopsy data in at least 75% of the randomized study participants. Compared to the ESRD patient population whose renal disease is caused by hypertension, women were underrepresented in the AASK Pilot Study. AASK Pilot Study participants had higher unemployment rates and lower income levels than African Americans in the general U.S. population.

TI  - Assessing medication adherence by pill count and electronic monitoring in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study.
AB  - The Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), an electronic monitor which records the date and time of bottle cap openings, and pill counts were used to assess patterns of adherence for the primary antihypertensive drug in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Pilot Study (AASK). Blacks with hypertension and moderately reduced renal function were randomized to one of two levels of blood pressure control and to one of three antihypertensive drug regimens: primary therapy with a calcium channel blocker, an angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor, or a beta-blocker. Of the 94 participants in AASK, 91 had MEMS recordings and pill counts for 313 regularly scheduled monthly follow-up visits. The average length of follow-up was 4.6 months. An acceptable level of adherence by pill count was achieved if 80% to 100% of the prescribed pills were not returned to the clinic. Adherence by MEMS to a once-a-day drug dosing schedule was acceptable if 80% of the time intervals between MEMS openings were within 24 +/- 6 h. Acceptable adherence by pill count was observed at 68% of the follow-up visits; MEMS indicated nonadherence at 47% of those visits. Blood pressure was within goal in 50% of the participants who were adherent by both pill count and MEMS throughout their follow-up visits, and only 14% of the participants who were identified nonadherent by one or both methods. These findings suggest that electronic monitoring is a useful adjunct to pill counts in assessing adherence to antihypertensive drugs. Feedback of electronically collected information on dosing intervals to participants and staff may enhance adherence.

TI  - Alpha-blockade and thiazide treatment of hypertension. A double-blind randomized trail comparing doxazosin and hydrochlorothiazide.
AB  - This trial involved 107 patients in a two-group, parallel, double-blind, randomized study comparing the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (dose 25 to 50 mg) and the alpha 1 antagonist, doxazosin (dose 2 to 16 mg). All randomized participants were followed for at least 1 year. Participants were recruited from the community. The study was carried out in four phases: Phase I-Baseline; Phase II-Monotherapy Titration; Phase III-Combination Therapy Titration; and Phase IV-Maintenance. The following measures were carried out: blood pressure, biochemistries, lipids/lipoproteins, quality of life, ambulatory electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, adverse experiences, and drug adherence. Both drugs were well tolerated, with only 4% taken off doxazosin and 7% off HCTZ. Adverse experiences were uncommon and mostly mild. Both drugs were effective in managing hypertension over 1 year of therapy. There was no difference noted in terms of efficacy of blood pressure lowering between the two study drugs, nor was there any evidence of tolerance developing or of any serious adverse effects. Average final doses for drugs were 7.8 mg for doxazosin and 36 mg for HCTZ. The results show that, over the course of 1 year, both drugs significantly lowered systolic and diastolic pressures compared to baseline; doxazosin (-19 and -16 mm Hg); HCTZ (-22 and 15 mm Hg). Blood pressure lowering was not significantly different between drugs. Sitting heart rate was not affected by drugs. Changes in quality of life measures were similar between groups. Echocardiographic measures at 1 year showed significant between-drug differences in change in left internal end systolic and diastolic dimensions and end systolic stress. Both doxazosin and HCTZ were effective drugs over 1 year for treating hypertension.

TI  - A telecommunications system for monitoring and counseling patients with hypertension. Impact on medication adherence and blood pressure control.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of automated telephone patient monitoring and counseling on patient adherence to antihypertensive medications and on blood pressure control. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 29 greater Boston communities. The study subjects were 267 patients recruited from community sites who were >or= 60 years of age, on antihypertensive medication, with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of >or= 160 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of >or= 90 mm Hg. The study compared subjects who received usual medical care with those who used a computer-controlled telephone system in addition to their usual medical care during a period of 6 months. Weekly, subjects in the telephone group reported self-measured blood pressures, knowledge and adherence to antihypertensive medication regimens, and medication side-effects. This information was sent to their physicians regularly. The main study outcome measures were change in antihypertensive medication adherence, SBP and DBP during 6 months, satisfaction of patient users, perceived utility for physicians, and cost-effectiveness. The mean age of the study population was 76.0 years; 77% were women; 11% were black. Mean antihypertensive medication adherence improved 17.7% for telephone system users and 11.7% for controls (P = .03). Mean DBP decreased 5.2 mm Hg in users compared to 0.8 mm Hg in controls (P = .02). Among nonadherent subjects, mean DBP decreased 6.0 mm Hg for telephone users, but increased 2.8 mm Hg for controls (P = .01). For telephone system users, mean DBP decreased more if their medication adherence improved (P = .03). The majority of telephone system users were satisfied with the system. Most physicians integrated it into their practices. The system was cost-effective, especially for nonadherent patient users. Therefore, weekly use of an automated telephone system improved medication adherence and blood pressure control in hypertension patients. This system can be used to monitor patients with hypertension or with other chronic diseases, and is likely to improve health outcomes and reduce health services utilization and costs.

TI  - Self-measurement of blood pressure: recommendations of the Canadian Coalition for High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide health care professionals with guidelines on the use of blood pressure self-measurement.
AB  - METHODS: Recommendations were devised after consideration of expert reviews and guidelines, personal files, international standards documents, personal communication with investigators and the results of a MEDLINE search (1966-94) using the term 'blood pressure determination'.
AB  - BENEFITS, HARMS, COSTS: Self-measurement of blood pressure can be used to detect white coat hypertension, monitor changes in blood pressure closely, more rapidly achieve desired blood pressure goals, increase adherence to antihypertensive therapy and improve patient self-reliance. However, self-measured blood pressure readings may be misleading because there is insufficient normative, prognostic and outcome data and because some patients may not take accurate measurements. The use of self-measurement of blood pressure has a relatively small direct cost and may result in an overall reduction in treatment costs.
AB  - RECOMMENDATIONS: Self-measured blood pressure readings can be a valuable supplement to clinic (or office) blood pressure readings. However, self-measurement is appropriate neither for patients who are physically or mentally incapable of accurate assessment and interpretation of readings nor for those who do not want to participate. Patients who self-monitor blood pressure require careful training in blood pressure measurement and instruction on the recording and interpretation of blood pressure readings. Advice to patients using monitoring equipment must take into account the needs and abilities of the patient. Although only a few electronic devices for the self-measurement of blood pressure have met recommended performance standards, their use may be more appropriate for some patients and the training requirements fewer than if manual devices are used.
AB  - VALIDATION: The guidelines of several expert groups were examined in the preparation of these recommendations. The recommendations were presented at the World Conference on Hypertension Control in 1995 and were reviewed by the parent societies of the Canadian Coalition for High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control.

TI  - [Multicenter National Study for the evaluation of the efficacy and tolerance of nifedipine oral release osmotic system in mild to moderate hypertension]. [Portuguese]
AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of nifedipine oros in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension without major target organ damage and the anti-hypertensive effect along the 24 hours.
AB  - METHODS: Two hundred and three patients were studied. After two weeks placebo running period single dose of nifedipine oros (30 mg/day) was administered for 8 weeks. At the end of the 4th week, the non-responders (diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg or reduction in diastolic pressure < 10 mmHg), had the dosage increased to 60 mg/day. Laboratory tests and 24h blood pressure monitoring (60 patients) were performed at the beginning and at the end of the study.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred and ninety one patients completed the study. Fifty nine percent were considered responders at the end of the 4th week with nifedipine oros 30 mg/day and 41% needed dosage increment to 60 mg/day. At the end of the 8th week, all patients were considered responders to nifedipine oros. The blood pressure control extended throughout the 24h of the day. The most common adverse events were edema (14.6%) and headache (12.4%). Good and very good tolerability were informed by 85% of the patients.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Nifedipine oros was able to control blood pressure efficaciously along the 24h period without important side effects. The possibility of once day dosage, increases the patient adherence to anti-hypertensive therapy.

TI  - Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study on glycemic control and complications in type II diabetes (VA CSDM). Results of the feasibility trial. Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study in Type II Diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is not clear whether intensive pharmacological therapy can be effectively sustained in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The relative risks and benefits of intensive insulin therapy in NIDDM are not well defined. Accordingly, we designed a feasibility study that compared standard therapy and intensive therapy in a group of NIDDM men who required insulin due to sustained hyperglycemia.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective trial was conducted in five medical centers in 153 men of 60 +/- 6 years of age who had a known diagnosis of diabetes for 7.8 +/- 4 years. They were randomly assigned to a standard insulin treatment group (one morning injection per day) or to an intensive therapy group designed to attain near-normal glycemia and a clinically significant separation of glycohemoglobin from the standard arm. A four-step plan was used in the intensive therapy group along with daily self-monitoring of glucose: 1) an evening insulin injection, 2) the same injection adding daytime glipizide, 3) two injections of insulin alone, and 4) multiple daily injections. Patient accrual and adherence, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), side effects, and measurements of endpoints for a prospective long-term trial were assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: Accrual goals were met, mean follow-up time was 27 months (range 18-35 months), and patients kept 98.6% of scheduled visits. After 6 months, the mean HbA1c in the intensive therapy group was at or below 7.3% and remained 2% lower than the standard group for the duration of the trial. Most of the decrease in the mean HbA1c in the intensive group was obtained by a single injection of evening intermediate insulin, alone or with daytime glipizide. By the end of the trial, 64% of the patients had advanced to two or more injections of insulin a day, aiming for normal HbA1c. However, only a small additional fall in HbA1c was attained. Severe hypoglycemia was rare (two events per 100 patients per year) and not significantly different between the groups, nor were changes in weight, blood pressure, or plasma lipids. There were 61 new cardiovascular events in 40 patients and 10 deaths (6 due to cardiovascular causes).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Intense stepped insulin therapy in NIDDM patients who have failed glycemic control on pharmacological therapy is effective in maintaining near-normal glycemic control for > 2 years without excessive severe hypoglycemia, weight gain, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. Cardiovascular event rates are high at this stage of NIDDM. A long-term prospective trial is needed to assess the risk-benefit ratio of intensified treatment of hyperglycemia in NIDDM patients requiring insulin.

TI  - [Diltiazem 180 mg in delayed release formulation in mild and moderate arterial hypertension]. [Portuguese]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Having acknowledge the need to treat arterial Hypertension concomitantly effective, safe and easy to comply with. These issues are the mainstay for a good adherence to a treatment that is long.
AB  - AIM: This clinical trial addresses the efficacy and safety of an extended release tablet of 180 mg of diltiazem, once daily, to treat mild to moderate hypertension.
AB  - POPULATION AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with mild to moderate hypertension were included in a multicentric, open trial consisting of three periods: washout (one week), placebo (one week) and a treatment period of four weeks with 180 mg slow-release tablets of diltiazem. Arterial Blood Pressure (BP) was measured through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) at the end of the first, second and sixth weeks. The therapeutic response was evaluated in terms of decrease in mmHg and in terms of systolic and diastolic loads. Treatment was considered successful when there was a drop in the medium diastolic BP to 90 mmHg or less and/or a decrease of at least 10 mmHg.
AB  - RESULTS: Twenty-three patients completed the trial. There was a significant decrease (p < 0.0001) in the medium diastolic and systolic 24-hour BP values. The efficacy parameters were met in 62.5% of the patients, nonetheless there was a drop of at least 5 mmHg in 82.6%. There was a statistically more significant response during the diurnal versus the nocturnal periods, according to both criteria.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Diltiazem, 180 mg extended-release tablet taken one daily, proved to be effective, over 24 hours, in controlling Hypertension in 62.5% of the enrolled patients while decreasing the medium diastolic BP by at least 5 mmHg in 82.5%.

TI  - Long-term functioning and well-being outcomes associated with physical activity and exercise in patients with chronic conditions in the Medical Outcomes Study.
AB  - This study was carried out to determine whether levels of physical activity of patients with various chronic diseases are associated with subsequent functioning and well-being. It was an observational 2-year longitudinal design. The setting was offices of medical and mental health practices within health maintenance organizations, large multispecialty groups, and solo practices or small single-specialty group practices in three U.S. cities. Included in the study were 1758 adult patients with one or more of the following: diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, depressive symptoms, or current depressive disorder. Outcome measures included physical, role, and functioning; energy/fatigue; pain intensity; sleep problems; depressed affect, anxiety, positive affect, and overall psychological distress/well-being; health distress; and current health perceptions. Cross-sectional (base-line), 2-year endpoint, and change score relationships were evaluated between baseline levels of physical activity and each outcome, controlling for chronic conditions, comorbidity, smoking, alcohol use, overweight, self-reported adherence, and other patient and study characteristics. Higher baseline levels of exercise were uniquely associated with better functioning and well-being at baseline and 2 years later for some measures. The magnitude of the differences varied by disease group, but tended to be between 0.17 and 0.39 of the baseline SD. Greater levels of exercise are associated with feeling and functioning better for patients with chronic conditions over a 2-year period, suggesting that this is a fruitful area for further study using controlled interventions.

TI  - Hypertension in Diabetes Study. III. Prospective study of therapy of hypertension in type 2 diabetic patients: efficacy of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade.
AB  - The Hypertension in Diabetes Study (HDS) is an ongoing, multicentre, prospective randomized intervention trial of therapy of hypertension (> or = 160 and/or > or = 90 mmHg) in Type 2 diabetic patients. It compares tight blood pressure control (aim: < 150/85 mmHg) versus less tight control (aim: < 180/105 mmHg) and, within the tight control group, an ACE inhibitor, captopril, versus a beta blocker, atenolol. We report the efficacy, side-effects of treatment, biochemical responses and incidence of hypoglycaemia in 755 patients (mean age 57 years, blood pressure 150/94 mmHg) followed for 2 years. At 2 years, blood pressure was 143/84 in the tight control and 156/90 mmHg in the less tight control group (p < 0.0001). Blood pressure reduction, adherence to therapy, incidence of side-effects and of hypoglycaemia were similar on captopril and on atenolol. Patients on atenolol had a greater increase in body weight (+2.3 vs +0.7 kg, p < 0.01) and a non-significant trend to a greater increase in triglyceride than patients on captopril. A large blood pressure difference between the tight control and less tight control groups was obtained, with captopril and atenolol having similar hypotensive effects. The study has the potential to determine whether strict blood pressure control reduces the incidence of diabetic complications and whether ACE inhibitor or beta-blocker therapy is clinically advantageous.

TI  - Intensified versus conventional management of gestational diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that intensified management of gestational diabetes mellitus on the basis of stringent glycemic control, verified glucose data, and adherence to an established criterion for insulin initiation results in near normoglycemia control and reduction of adverse outcomes.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, population-based study compared the effect on perinatal outcome of conventional (n = 1316) and intensified (n = 1145) management. Group assignment was based on availability of memory-based reflectance meters at entry to the program. A contemporaneous randomized control group (nondiabetic, n = 4922) was selected.
AB  - RESULTS: The diabetic groups were comparable in demographic characteristics and in factors associated with higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcome, such as previous macrosomia, previous gestational diabetes mellitus, and family history of diabetes. The control group was younger, less obese, and had a lower rate of previous macrosomia. The intensified management group had rates of macrosomia, cesarean section, metabolic complications, shoulder dystocia, stillbirth, neonatal intensive care unit days, and respiratory complications lower than those in the conventional management group and comparable to those of the nondiabetic controls. Other maternal complication rates, such as for preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, and infection, were similar for the three groups. Mean blood glucose levels were a good predictor of perinatal outcome. Gestational age at delivery, previous history of macrosomia, and overall mean blood glucose levels were the only significant predictors of birth weight percentile in both diabetic groups (logistic regression).
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intensified management approach is significantly associated with enhanced perinatal outcome. This management strategy clarifies the relationship between glycemic control and neonatal outcome.

TI  - Comprehensive individualised nonpharmacological treatment programme for hypertension in physician-nurse clinics: two year follow-up.
AB  - A comprehensive programme of nonpharmacological control of hypertension (balanced nutrition, satisfactory weight, enhanced physical activity, relaxation technique, smoking cessation) by primary care physician-nurse (PN) teams who were instructed and routinely advised by a paramedical professional (PP) team (psychologist, nutritionist and physical activity instructor) was developed with the aim of increasing long-term compliance. To evaluate effectiveness, 52 mild and moderate hypertensives without target organ damage were randomly allocated to six weekly meetings of individual intensive instruction by PN teams alone, or direct group instructions by PP teams (24 and 28 patients, respectively). The respective results at 11 months and 24 months follow-up compared with baseline were: (1) 56.9% and 58.8% showed minimal satisfactory reduction of weight, (2) 49% and 58.8% showed minimal satisfactory increase in physical activity, (3) the reported increase in physical activity at 11 months follow-up was validated by significantly correlated improved performance in ergometry, (4) 75% and 40% of the patients performed relaxation vs. 2% at baseline and (5) 71% and 59% needed no medication or reduced dose to control BP, and these changes were significantly (P < 0.02) correlated with weight reduction and increased physical activity. As no differences were found between the two modes of treatment, we conclude that our programme can be successfully applied by the PN primary care teams to increase adherence to nonpharmacological measures in the control of hypertension.

TI  - Physicians' characteristics influence patients' adherence to medical treatment: results from the Medical Outcomes Study.
AB  - The influence of physicians' attributes and practice style on patients' adherence to treatment was examined in a 2-year longitudinal study of 186 physicians and their diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease patients. A physician-level analysis was conducted, controlling for baseline patient adherence rates and for patient characteristics predictive of adherence in previous analyses. General adherence and adherence to medication, exercise, and diet recommendations were examined. Baseline adherence rates were associated with adherence rates 2 years later. Other predictors were physician job satisfaction (general adherence), number of patients seen per week (medication), scheduling a follow-up appointment (medication), tendency to answer patients' questions (exercise), number of tests ordered (diet), seriousness of illness (diet), physician specialty (medication, diet), and patient health distress (medication, exercise).

TI  - Can guava fruit intake decrease blood pressure and blood lipids?.
AB  - A randomized, single-blind, controlled trial was conducted to examine the effects of guava fruit intake on BPs and blood lipids in patients with essential hypertension. Of 145 hypertensives that entered the trial, 72 patients were assigned to take a soluble fibre and a potassium-rich diet containing 0.5-1.0 kg of guava daily (group A) and 73 patients to their usual diet (group B), while salt, fat, cholesterol, caffeine and alcohol intake were similar in both groups. Mean age, mean body weight and male sex, were similar, and so were risk factors, mean BPs, mean serum sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, triglycerides, cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol in both groups. Dietary adherence to guava intake was checked by a questionnaire. After four weeks of follow-up on an increased consumption of dietary potassium and low sodium/potassium ratio, group A patients were associated with 7.5/8.5 mmHg net decrease in mean systolic and diastolic pressures compared with group B. Increased intake of soluble dietary fibre (47.8 +/- 11.5 vs. 9.5 +/- 0.85 g/day) was associated with a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol (7.9%), triglycerides (7.0%) and an insignificant increase in HDL-cholesterol (4.6%) with a mild increase in the ratio of total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol in group A patients compared with group B. It is possible that an increased consumption of guava fruit can cause a substantial reduction in BPs and blood lipids with a lack of decrease in HDL-cholesterol due to its higher potassium and soluble fibre content, respectively.

TI  - Effect of problem-based, self-directed undergraduate education on life-long learning.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare how well graduates of a self-directed, problem-based undergraduate curriculum (at McMaster University [MU], Hamilton, Ont.) and those of a traditional curriculum (at the University of Toronto [UT]) who go on to primary care careers keep up to date with current clinical practice guidelines.
AB  - DESIGN: Analytic survey. Management of hypertension was chosen as an appropriate topic to assess guideline adherence. An updated version of a previously validated questionnaire was mailed to the participants for self-completion.
AB  - SETTING: Private primary care practices in southern Ontario.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 48 MU graduates and 48 UT graduates, stratified for year of graduation (1974 to 1985) and sex, who were in family or general practice in Ontario; 87% of the eligible subjects in each group responded.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall and component-specific scores; analysis was blind to study group.
AB  - RESULTS: The overall mean scores were 56 (68%) of a possible 82 for the MU graduates and 51 (62%) for the UT graduates (difference between the means 5, 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 8.2; p < 0.01). Multivariate linear regression analysis of seven factors that might affect questionnaire scores revealed that only the medical school was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The MU graduates had significantly higher mean scores than the UT graduates for two components of the questionnaire: knowledge of recommended blood pressures for treatment (p < 0.05) and successful approaches to enhance compliance (p < 0.005). The trends were similar for the other components but but were not significant.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The graduates of a problem-based, self-directed undergraduate curriculum are more up to date in knowledge of the management of hypertension than graduates of a traditional curriculum.

TI  - MIS (Multicentric Isradipine Study of antihypertensive therapy).
AB  - One-year open Multicentric Isradipine Study (MIS) performed in 7 centres in Czechoslovakia included 144 patients with mild and moderate hypertension. Isradipine was given at a dose of 2.5 mg daily. If normalization of diastolic blood pressure (BP) had not been reached, the dosage was increased to 5 mg. Monotherapy with isradipine normalized diastolic BP in 44% of patients. Isradipine (5 mg daily) was combined with bopindolol in patients in whom isradipine alone failed to normalize diastolic BP. These had higher mean systolic and diastolic BP, body weight, erythrocyte and platelet counts at the beginning of the study. The combination of isradipine with bopindolol normalized diastolic BP in 87% of the group at the end of 48 weeks' treatment. Tolerance was excellent in 82% of patients. Treatment was discontinued in 8% patients, undesirable effects being the reason in 2%, ineffective therapy in 2% and poor adherence to therapy in 4%. Isradipine in monotherapy or in combination with bopindolol did not exert an adverse effect on the metabolic risk factors of ischaemic heart disease (cholesterol, glycaemia).

TI  - Effects of guava intake on serum total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and on systemic blood pressure.
AB  - There is evidence that inclusion of high fiber foods such as oats, fruits and vegetables in the diet can decrease fat intake and modulate blood lipids. To test this hypothesis, 61 group A and 59 group B patients with essential hypertension were administered guava fruit preferably before meals in a foods-to-eat approach rather than foods-to-restrict, in a randomized and single-blind fashion for 12 weeks. At entry into the study, mean age, male sex, mean body mass index, percentages of risk factors and mean levels of blood lipids were comparable between groups A and B. Adherence to guava consumption was assessed by questionnaires and weighing of guava intake by 24-hour recall after 12 weeks of follow-up. Nutrient intakes including saturated and total fat were significantly decreased; carbohydrates, total and soluble fiber and vitamins and mineral intakes were significantly higher in group A than in group B at 12 weeks. There was a significant net decrease in serum total cholesterol (9.9%), triglycerides (7.7%) and blood pressures (9.0/8.0 mm Hg) with a significant net increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (8.0%) after 12 weeks of guava fruit substitution in group A than in group B. By adding moderate amounts of guava fruit in the usual diet, changes in dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates may occur, providing significant amounts of soluble dietary fiber and antioxidant vitamins and minerals without any adverse effects. There is a greater decrease in lipoprotein metabolism and blood pressures.

TI  - Relation of hostility to medication adherence, symptom complaints, and blood pressure reduction in a clinical field trial of antihypertensive medication.
AB  - The impact of hostility was examined in relation to the conduct and results of a clinical field trial. Data were derived from a multi-center randomized double-blind study of the comparative effects of antihypertensive therapy (captopril, methyldopa and propranolol) on the quality of life of 620 hypertensive men. Hostility levels were higher in subjects reporting skipping medication dosages compared to those reporting they always complied with the medication schedule. Reporting of symptoms often associated with antihypertensive drug regimens was positively related to hostility scores throughout the study, even during the blinded placebo period. Persons with high hostility scores showed the greatest decline in blood pressure independent of type of antihypertensive medication. However, there was some limited evidence that hostility levels were significantly reduced by one antihypertensive medication. Overall, the present findings suggest that double-blind pharmacologic clinical trials may benefit from using reliable measures of hostility as covariates in the evaluation of symptom reports and amount of blood pressure reduction.

AB  - The effects of adenosine (ADO) on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) distribution, vascular compliance (C), and permeability were determined in normal and PMA-injured isolated rabbit lungs perfused with a 1:1 mixture of 6% albumin in Krebs-Henseleit buffer and autologous blood. ADO or vehicle was continuously infused into the reservoir at 1,4, or 5 mumol/min after a 1-mumol bolus of ADO or vehicle. The capillary filtration coefficient (Kf) and arterial, venous, and double occlusion pressures were measured at baseline and 30 min after phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 4 x 10(-8) M) or vehicle. Perfusate differential and total leukocyte counts as well as adenine nucleotides, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) concentrations were determined at each measurement period. ADO was recovered as hypoxanthine and inosine in the perfusate. ADO alone did not alter PVR, C, Kf, or TxB2 but reduced 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels. PMA induced an increase in Kf (0.024 +/- 0.002 to 0.040 +/- 0.006 g.cmH2O-1.min-1, P less than 0.05) that was completely blocked by 4 or 5 mumol/min ADO. PVR increased by 63 +/- 11% after PMA, primarily in the arteries and arterial and venous microvessels. The postcapillary resistance increase was blunted by 4 mumol/min ADO; 5 mumol/min ADO prevented the PVR increase in all segments. ADO did not affect the initial adherence of neutrophils in the lung or the PMA-induced 87 +/- 2% decrease in circulating leukocytes (greater than 98% lymphocytes) or threefold increase in TxB2 levels. These results suggest that protection by ADO is not mediated by the altering of cyclooxygenase products or by leukocyte adherence.

TI  - Effect of health education in promoting prescription refill compliance among patients with hypertension.
AB  - A multifactorial health-education program designed to enhance compliance with a once-daily regimen of atenolol was evaluated among 453 patients enrolled in health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The initiation of the 180-day study period was used to classify patients as either new or existing cases of hypertension. In turn, patients in these two categories were randomly assigned to a control or an experimental group. Patients assigned to the experimental groups received an enrollment kit upon exercising their initial prescription (new patients) or their first refill request (existing patients). The kit contained: a 30-day supply of atenolol; an educational newsletter about hypertension; information on nutrition and life-style changes; and an explanation of the intent and content of the program. Before the next scheduled prescription-refill date, each patient was contacted by telephone to inquire about his or her experience with the therapy and to stress the importance of adherence to the regimen. Each month thereafter, the newsletter and an enclosed prescription-refill reminder were mailed to each patient. The medication possession ratio, defined as the number of days' supply of atenolol obtained by a patient during the 180-day study period, was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.001) enhanced for the new and existing experimental groups relative to the control groups. Multiple regression analyses revealed that enrollment in the health-education program increased the number of days' supply of atenolol obtained by existing patients by 27 (P less than or equal to 0.001), and by new patients by 40 (P less than or equal to 0.001).

TI  - Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension.
AB  - The cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension depends on the pretreatment level of blood pressure, age and sex of the patient, presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, long-term control of blood pressure, and the annual costs of treatment. Treatment of very mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, 90-94 mm Hg), even if the benefits do exceed the risks, does not appear to be particularly cost-effective. Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of hypertension management lie in 1) avoidance of patient mislabeling by careful documentation of blood pressures on multiple occasions in the office and during usual activities outside the office before the diagnosis is made and treatment is begun; 2) efforts to increase adherence to scheduled visits and medication regimens; 3) attempts to step-down dosages or discontinue medications after periods of good blood pressure control; 4) explicit consideration of costs, as well as benefits, in decisions on the needed frequency of office visits, choice of medications, and use of laboratory tests; and 5) efforts to improve practice efficiency. Future practice guidelines for hypertension management should take these factors into account and should make trade-offs between benefits, risks, and costs explicit for specific types of patients.

TI  - Therapeutic adherence in the elderly: transdermal clonidine compared to oral verapamil for hypertension.
AB  - This double-blind, double-dummy, randomized clinical trial, conducted in elderly patients with mild hypertension, compared adherence to treatment, efficacy, side effects, and quality of life during treatment with transdermal clonidine versus oral sustained-release verapamil (verapamil-SR). Blood pressure declined significantly--from 148/95 mm Hg at baseline to 139/84 after titration and 135/86 after maintenance--with transdermal clonidine (n = 29), and from 156/96 to 144/85 and 148/88, respectively, with verapamil-SR (n = 29). Adverse event rates and quality-of-life questionnaire responses were similar in the two treatment groups. Transdermal clonidine was worn as directed during more than 96% of patient-weeks of treatment. Compliance with the oral verapamil regimen was less consistent: Verapamil-SR was taken as directed during approximately 50% of patient-weeks of therapy, and individual compliance, assessed by tablet counts, varied from 50-120%. In all, 86% of subjects were satisfied or highly satisfied with the convenience of transdermal therapy; 87% reported that side effects were slightly or not bothersome; 65% indicated that transdermal patches were more convenient than oral therapy; and almost 60% preferred transdermal to oral therapy. In this study transdermal clonidine and oral verapamil were equally safe and effective. A substantial majority of patients preferred transdermal to oral therapy, and adherence to treatment was greater with transdermal therapy.

TI  - Risk factor changes after cessation of intervention in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. The MRFIT Research Group.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The degree of maintenance of risk factor changes observed in post-trial follow-up of participants in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) provides insights into long-term determinants of preventive behaviors, as well as post-trial mortality differentials.
AB  - METHODS: Nine hundred eighty-nine former MRFIT participants at four clinical centers were invited to be reexamined 2-3.5 years after the end of this 6- to 8-year trial. Seventy percent came to the clinics for measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma lipids and lipoproteins, serum thiocyanate, and dietary food frequency. With the addition of phone interviews, 82% provided self-report data on cigarette smoking and use of antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - RESULTS: Comparison of Special Intervention (SI) and Usual Care (UC) groups showed that differences persisted for total (6.5 mg/dl, P = 0.02) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.4 mg/dl, P = 0.04), and for diastolic blood pressure (1.6 mm Hg, P = 0.02). Differences were not significant for systolic blood pressure (1.8 mm Hg, P = 0.12), cigarette smoking, and serum thiocyanate. The plasma cholesterol difference represented 70% of the value at the end of intervention, and food frequency profiles were consistent with maintenance of an SI - UC difference. Loss of the SI - UC difference in smoking was attributable to both UC cessation and SI recidivism. The blood pressure difference was not attributable to different proportions of SI and UC men on medications, but possibly to differences in diuretic doses, use of multiple drugs, and adherence. There was a persisting contrast in use of specific diuretics, with more frequent use of chlorthalidone and less of hydrochlorothiazide in the SI group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cholesterol-lowering dietary changes are self-sustaining, while smoking cessation is less so, and may require continued intervention. Finally, the SI - UC differences in use of specific diuretics remains one hypothesis for explaining a portion of post-trial mortality trends.

TI  - The effect of a household partner and home urine monitoring on adherence to a sodium restricted diet.
AB  - To evaluate the effects of social support and home urine monitoring on success with dietary sodium reduction, 114 essential hypertensive adults and a household partner were recruited. One of the pair was required to be the food preparer. Patients with their partners were randomly assigned to either an active or passive partner condition. During dietary counseling in the active condition, both patient and partner were involved in instructions to change their diet to reduce their daily sodium intake to 80 mmol or less. In the passive condition, the partners were present during the dietary counseling, but no effort was made to involve them directly in the instruction or to encourage them to make personal dietary changes. Patients and active partners collected two 24-hr urine collections between each of the first two counseling sessions and received feedback on the sodium results by a telephone call. In the passive partner condition, only patients collected urine for feedback. At the end of the 6 week instructional period, all patients and partners collected a 24-hr urine and had their blood pressure assessed. Half of each group was also randomly assigned to have access to a system for periodic home-monitoring of urine for sodium content during a 3-month period beginning at week 6 of the study (immediate). The delayed feedback group received the home-monitoring three months after completion of the dietary instruction. All patients, but only active partners, used the feedback system during their assignment periods and collected a 24-hr urine monthly between 6 and 30 weeks of the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Bopindolol: Czechoslovak experience with a new beta blocker in the treatment of hypertension.
AB  - Bopindolol is a nonselective beta blocker with mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. One of the drug's main benefits is its prolonged effect, lasting for 24 hours, which makes it possible to administer bopindolol in a single daily dose, a fact that may improve patient adherence to therapy. A double-blind study was performed in two centers, comparing bopindolol with metoprolol in 86 hypertensive patients. Baseline diastolic blood pressure (BP) was 100 to 120 mm Hg. The effects of bopindolol or metoprolol on BP and heart rate were similar: return to normal values was achieved in 70% of patients with either drug. A 6-month study at another center found that bopindolol did not affect the levels of total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. Another 12-month study documented a decrease in total cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) A1 and apo B. The apo A/B ratio rose, thus improving the atherosclerotic index. No deterioration of glucose tolerance or immunoreactive insulin response to glucose was seen after 6 months of bopindolol administration. Bopindolol satisfactorily modifies not only resting but also exercise BP during isometric and isotonic load, thus reducing BP fluctuation during physical activities of the hypertensive patient. The drug exerts no effect on renal and liver function, electrolyte balance and hematologic parameters. Bopindolol is a very useful drug of first choice in mild and moderate hypertension. Bopindolol's main advantages include its prolonged action, good tolerance and a beneficial effect on risk factors of atherosclerosis (lipid and carbohydrate metabolism).

TI  - A comparison of the effect of a hypertension education program among black and white participants.
AB  - Black Americans face a higher risk of hypertension than other Americans. Because of the differences in risk status and environmental or genetic factors that may contribute to hypertension, it is important to compare the effectiveness of hypertension intervention for blacks and for whites. While a diminished effect of intervention among blacks might be expected due to such factors as lower socioeconomic status, high stress, and salt-sensitivity, a comparison between black and white participants in a six-session hypertension education series showed no significant differences in outcome. Overall, the program was successful in improving knowledge gained regarding control of blood pressure; encouraging positive behavior changes; and in reducing by 68 percent the number of participants whose blood pressure was elevated by the end of the program. However, program attendance was less frequent in black communities than in white communities. Marketing strategies to attract more black participants, and adherence strategies to retain those who are recruited, are discussed.

TI  - Long-term nopharmacological treatment for mild to moderate hypertension.
AB  - Ninety-one middle-aged men and women with untreated mild hypertension were allocated to a nopharmacological treatment group or to a control group. Members of the treatment group were instructed to reduce daily sodium intake to less than 70 mmol, to reduce the intake of saturated fat, to lose weight if necessary and to perform regular physical exercise and relaxation training. Adherence to and effects of the programme on blood pressure and serum lipids were monitored for 12 months. In the treatment group, daily sodium excretion decreased to and remained at 50% of its original level (P less than 0.001), and there was a significant reduction in saturated fat intake. The average weight reduction was modest. Adherence to physical exercise and relaxation training regimens was poor. The net decreases (difference in changes between treatment and control group) in blood pressure were greatest during the first 3 months: in men the decrease in systolic blood pressure was 11.3 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and in diastolic blood pressure 8.3 mmHg (P less than 0.001); in women the decrease in systolic blood pressure was 10.8 mmHg (P less than 0.01) and in diastolic blood pressure 6.4 mmHg (P less than 0.01). However, this decrease diminished during the last 3 months to approximately one half owing to blood pressure reduction in controls. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly in treated men and women.

TI  - Attributions for dietary failures: problems reported by participants in the Hypertension Prevention Trial.
AB  - Assigned participants in the Hypertension Prevention Trial to one of four diets for a period of 3 years: (a) weight loss, (b) reduced sodium, (c) weight loss plus reduced sodium, and (d) reduced sodium plus increased potassium. At 6-month intervals, they reported problems they were having adhering to their diets. Problem attributions were coded along the dimensions of internality, stability, and controllability and were categorized as intrapersonal or extrapersonal. Attributions were found to differ by type of diet and sex of participant. Participants assigned to weight-loss groups were significantly more likely than those assigned to non-weight-loss groups to blame themselves for their problems with adherence, making characterological as opposed to external or situational attributions. Men perceived problems to be more controllable than women. Attributions did not predict weight loss, change in urinary sodium, or change in potassium excretion.

TI  - Longitudinally measured blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, and cognitive performance: the Framingham Study.
AB  - The relation of longitudinally measured blood pressure to cognitive performance in the absence of clinically diagnosed cerebrovascular disease was investigated in the Framingham Study. In 1976-1978, neuropsychologic testing was administered to 1993 participants aged 55-89 years. Performance on an education-adjusted composite of these tests was examined in relation to measures of chronicity of hypertension as well as the average systolic and average diastolic blood pressure. All analyses were stratified by antihypertensive medication use during the 2 years prior to cognitive testing and adjusted for age, sex, occupation, alcohol consumption, and participation rate in prior examination cycles. Among subjects on drug therapy for hypertension, there was no association between cognitive performance and longitudinally measured blood pressure. The proportion of cycles in which hypertension was present and average systolic and diastolic blood pressure had a significant inverse relation with cognitive performance only in the group not on antihypertensive drug therapy. However, among subjects on antihypertensive medication at earlier cycles, there was a highly significant graded relation between cognitive impairment and the probability of being off medication at the time of testing. These results suggest that hypertension-related subclinical vascular disease is not an important cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly. Cognitive impairment may, however, be associated with a reduced adherence to drug treatment regimens.

TI  - Family physicians and general internists: do they treat hypertensive patients differently?.
AB  - This study compared 51 San Francisco Bay Area family physicians and 47 general internists in their treatment of hypertensive patients. Charts from 2254 patients of these physicians were reviewed. The average age and percentage of board certification of both groups of physicians are similar. Patients of general internists were slightly older than the family practice patients (average age 61 vs 59 years). The general internists saw significantly fewer patients per hour (3.0) than the family physicians (3.6). Family physicians were more likely to employ a registered nurse (33%) than were general internists (17%), and family physicians were twice as likely to delegate patient education to office staff than were the general internists. The mean number and kinds of antihypertensive medications prescribed were similar. Internists did more laboratory testing, but the difference was not statistically significant. General internists were more likely to change medication when their patients' blood pressure was uncontrolled than were family physicians (in 60% vs 40% of patients, P = .02), and they were also more likely to recall uncontrolled patients within 3 months than were family physicians (50% vs 35% of patients, P = .05). There was no significant difference in mean diastolic blood pressure or in hypertension-related behaviors, such as medication adherence, aerobic exercise, alcohol consumption, or amount of dietary salt, between the two patient groups; however, over 35% of patients of both groups had elevated blood pressure readings despite taking medications. Overall, there were more similarities than differences in the care physicians provided. Efforts to change physician performance in the treatment of hypertensive patients are still warranted and equally applicable to both groups.

TI  - Automated control of postoperative hypertension: a prospective, randomized multicenter study.
AB  - Hypertension after a cardiac operation is a frequent phenomenon. Complications resulting from this include bleeding, disruption of vascular suture lines, subendocardial ischemia, and possible cerebrovascular accidents. Treatment with sodium nitroprusside has become accepted practice to prevent these complications. To improve control of arterial blood pressure, a closed-loop system for sodium nitroprusside administration was developed. A prospective, randomized multicenter study was carried out postoperatively in 180 cardiac surgical patients to evaluate the performance of this system compared with manual control of infusion. Adherence of mean arterial blood pressure to +/- 10% of the target blood pressure occurred 85% of the time with the automatic system and 61% of the time with manual regulation (p less than 0.0001). With the automatic system, there was less hypertension (9% versus 22%; p less than 0.0001) and hypotension (6% versus 22%; p less than 0.0001). The superior control of hypertension was achieved more rapidly with less requirement for nurse regulation of infusion rate. The superior control of blood pressure resulted in less chest tube drainage in the automatic mode (720 mL versus 840 mL; p less than 0.05).

TI  - Uncontrolled hypertension in type 1 diabetes: assessment of patients' desires about treatment and improvement of blood pressure control by a structured treatment and teaching programme.
AB  - Control of arterial blood pressure at near-normal levels is of importance for the prognosis of patients with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. In non-diabetic populations patient compliance to antihypertensive therapy is frequently poor, especially in young people. Thirty-seven consecutive eligible patients with longstanding Type 1 diabetes and persistently uncontrolled hypertension were questioned about their preferences regarding hypertension treatment. Throughout they expressed a strong desire for more information about hypertension and for active participation in monitoring of blood pressure and therapeutic decision-making. In addition, they showed considerable reluctance to accept a pharmacological intervention. Therefore, in order to improve blood pressure control, the patients participated in a structured outpatient hypertension treatment and teaching programme for groups of about 6 patients consisting of four teaching sessions at weekly intervals. The programme comprised home-monitoring of blood pressure and involvement of the patients in treatment decision-making. In 34 patients who had a complete follow-up examination after an average of 16 months, mean sitting arterial pressure had decreased from 111 to 101 mmHg (p less than 0.001) and 53% of the patients were below 140/90 mmHg. The number and dosage of prescribed antihypertensive agents remained unchanged by the intervention. Sodium intake was not reduced during the study, but pulse rate decreased significantly in patients treated with beta-adrenergic blockers and serum uric acid rose in patients on diuretic therapy, suggesting increased adherence of the patients to prescribed antihypertensive drug therapy. In 34 comparable Type 1 diabetic patients who were not subjected to a hypertension treatment and teaching programme mean arterial blood pressure remained unchanged during a 12-month period.

TI  - Selected allied health professionals' self-confidence in health promotion counseling skills and interest in continuing education programs.
AB  - Mail surveys of samples of dental hygienists (n = 90, 36% response), registered dietitians (n = 262, 52% response), and physician assistants (n = 289, 89% response) in Texas and certified nurse midwives (n = 143, 57% response) in the US provided data regarding their confidence that they possess skills and knowledge to counsel patients about selected areas of health promotion (self-efficacy). Also, the surveys gathered information regarding respondents' beliefs that patients will follow through on their recommendations (adherence expectation), and their interest in continuing education programs. Overall, respondents displayed highest self-efficacy with regard to counseling patients about blood pressure and smoking. Confidence was lowest in illicit drug abuse and mental health areas. Certified nurse midwives and physician assistants indicated confidence in many more areas than the other two groups. Respondents consistently expressed less certainty about patient adherence than about their own skills and knowledge. They generally indicated a high degree of interest in continuing education across the several health promotion topics. Modest relationships were observed between self-efficacy and interest in continuing education programs for physician assistants and registered dietitians, indicating that those with greater self-efficacy had a greater interest in building their skills. A similar pattern was observed among physician assistant respondents with respect to adherence expectations.

TI  - Dietary sodium restriction as adjunctive treatment of hypertension.
AB  - To examine the effect of modest dietary sodium ion restriction in treated hypertensive individuals, we studied 114 hypertensive patients undergoing individualized dietary counseling with a research dietitian to achieve reduction in dietary sodium ion intake. A significant reduction in mean sodium ion intake was achieved after the first of three lessons and was maintained for 30 weeks with no change in potassium ion intake. Significant falls in blood pressure and body weight were observed with no significant correlations noted between the two variables, implying independence of these effects. Individuals compliant with the dietary sodium ion restriction goal (urinary excretion, less than or equal to 80 mmol/d [less than or equal to 80 mEq/24 h]) were more likely to have a reduction in number of medications than those not reaching that goal. Ninety-eight of the 114 patients completed the entire 30 weeks. Patients who dropped out tended to have lower diastolic blood pressures and required fewer medications for blood pressure control than those who completed the 30 weeks. For these reasons, patients in the former group may have been less highly motivated to complete the study. These observations suggest that modest dietary sodium ion restriction is feasible in treated hypertensive patients and that adherence to such a regimen may permit blood pressure control with fewer medications.

TI  - Hypertension--unexpected research results and program redirection.
AB  - The California Department of Health Services (DHS) has conducted two statewide surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of a coordinated hypertension control program. Unfortunately, the expected reduction in the prevalence of elevated blood pressure did not occur. Public knowledge about hypertension did increase, but among hypertensive persons awareness, treatment, and control did not improve. The responses to several survey questions were examined to determine why there was no improvement in the rate of control of elevated blood pressure. Obviously, many persons with hypertension have not complied with medical advice at various points in the hypertension control system. Consequently, the DHS is redirecting its Hypertension Control Program. Less emphasis is being placed on the coordination of blood pressure control resources, including public education, while more emphasis is being placed on increasing compliance with treatment recommendations, focusing on patient tracking as described by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program and long-term adherence to therapy as discussed in the 1984 Report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.

TI  - Vegetarian diet and blood pressure.
AB  - There is now convincing evidence from epidemiological studies and randomized controlled trials that adoption of an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet leads to blood pressure reduction in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects. This effect appears to be independent of both dietary sodium and weight loss but additive to effects of weight reduction. Long-term adherence to a vegetarian diet is associated with less of a rise of blood pressure with age and a decreased prevalence of hypertension. The nutrients responsible for these effects have not been clearly identified and the mechanisms involved are unknown. Resolution of these questions is needed to enable more widespread adoption of dietary changes which may reduce the prevalence of hypertension, reduce antihypertensive drug dependence and by effects on blood pressure and blood lipids ameliorate the natural history of hypertensive cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Acute hypertension selectively potentiates constrictor responses of large coronary arteries to serotonin by altering endothelial function in vivo.
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that acute coronary artery hypertension may damage vascular endothelium and alter vasomotor responses to humoral agents. We examined effects of intracoronary infusion of the endothelium-dependent agent serotonin and two endothelium-independent agents, angiotensin II and methoxamine, on large coronary artery diameter in the blood perfused dog heart. Responses were examined before and 30 minutes after brief periods of coronary hypertension (200 mm Hg for 10 seconds to 15 minutes). In open-chest anesthetized dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused at constant pressure. Coronary diameter (D) was measured with piezoelectric crystals. At a control perfusion pressure of 80 mm Hg, serotonin produced dose-dependent constriction of the large coronary artery (mean +/- SEM; delta D = -22 +/- 10 microns at 5 micrograms/min; -108 +/- 50 microns at 50 micrograms/min). Increasing perfusion pressure to 200 mm Hg increased flow 515 +/- 79% and coronary diameter 509 +/- 9 microns. After 15 minutes of hypertension, when coronary diameter had returned to baseline values, the constriction of the large artery to serotonin was potentiated (delta D = -89 +/- 33 microns at 5 micrograms/min; -207 +/- 45 microns at 50 micrograms/min; p less than 0.05). Hypertension for 1-5 minutes potentiated constrictor responses of large coronary arteries for at least 2 1/2 hours. Removal of endothelium prevented effects of hypertension on constrictor responses of large arteries to serotonin. Hypertension did not alter constrictor responses to angiotension II (1 and 2.5 micrograms/min) or methoxamine (50 and 100 micrograms/min) or the dilator response to acetylcholine (40 micrograms/min). Acute hypertension altered endothelial morphology. There were small endothelial craters following 10 seconds of hypertension, and disruption of endothelial junctions with leukocyte adherence following 1-15 minutes of hypertension. We conclude that acute hypertension alters constrictor responses of large coronary arteries to serotonin by impairing endothelial function and not by directly affecting vascular smooth muscle. These effects of acute hypertension on vascular reactivity are selective in that they do not involve non-endothelium-dependent agents or the endothelium-dependent agent, acetylcholine. The effect of hypertension also persists long after pressure is restored to normotensive levels.

TI  - Determinants of adherence to medical regimens by hypertensive patients.
AB  - This study employed multivariate analyses and structural modeling procedures to examine a model for the determinants of adherence to medical regimens. Fifty adult hypertensive patients at a health maintenance organization completed questionnaires and participated in home interviews over a 10-week period. Knowledge of medical regimens, information communication between the patient and the medical professionals, satisfaction with health-care providers, health locus of control, social support, and treatment disruption to life-style were assessed. Adherence was assessed through self-report and behavioral (i.e., pill-count ratio, percentage of kept medical appointments) indices. Finally, repeated blood-pressure measurements were obtained. Structural modeling procedures revealed that greater expectancy for internal control over health and hypertension, greater knowledge of the treatment regimen, and stronger social support were significant determinants of adherence; in turn, higher levels of adherence facilitated blood-pressure reduction.

TI  - Home testing of urine chloride to estimate dietary sodium intake: evaluation of feasibility and accuracy.
AB  - To estimate the utility of quantab chloride titrators, a product of Ames Laboratories, in estimating urine and diet sodium, two study populations were examined. The first consisted of 56 normotensive individuals providing timed, overnight, urine collections and 24-hour food records as part of the baseline assessment for a hypertension prevention study. The second group consisted of 19 study employees, who were instructed to maintain a low sodium diet, and to self-assess diet sodium and urine chloride at home. Results showed that urine chloride measured by quantab was highly correlated with urine sodium. Neither urine chloride nor urine sodium correlated highly with the previous day's intake of dietary sodium as measured by food record. It is estimated that five overnight urine samples would be required to estimate food record sodium to within +/- 25 mEq in individuals with relatively stable diets. Home assessment of urine chloride is feasible. It seems likely that clinical procedures which combine self-monitoring of dietary sodium intake by food record and home measurement of urine chloride concentration would be an effective way of providing persons prescribed sodium restricted diets with continuous and convergent feedback about their success in dietary adherence.

TI  - A long-term nutrition intervention experience: lipid responses and dietary adherence patterns in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial.
AB  - Nutrition counselors in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) were able to help middle-aged men who were at high risk for coronary heart disease change their dietary habits, maintain those changes over time, and decrease their serum cholesterol levels. Most of a 7.5% mean serum cholesterol reduction achieved after 6 years of nutrition intervention occurred during the first year of the trial and was thereafter sustained. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction decreases indicated improvement in terms of coronary heart disease risk. The food record rating, a numerical, semi-objective adherence technique that assesses a 3-day food record with respect to lipid-lowering potential, was used throughout the trial to measure adherence to recommended food patterns. Participants with lower food record rating scores, which indicate better adherence, demonstrated greater reductions in serum total cholesterol, plasma total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein fraction cholesterol determinations on a group basis. Subjective evaluations of the suitability of home and working environments, evidence of deviation from the MRFIT food patterns, and overall nutrition program motivation also showed that as ratings in each category became more favorable, lower food record rating scores and greater blood lipid reductions were consistently observed. The subgroup of participants who were non-smokers and not hypertensive demonstrated greater lipid responses and better dietary adherence. Continued smoking and antihypertensive medications appeared to adversely influence dietary adherence and/or lipid reductions. The MRFIT experience, however, demonstrated for the first time that dietary changes and blood lipid reductions can be achieved after the initial intervention effect, despite a continued emphasis on high blood pressure management and smoking cessation.

TI  - Does self-measurement of blood pressure improve patient compliance in hypertension?.
AB  - Compliance with antihypertensive therapy was measured before and after distribution of non-automatic blood pressure devices. After 2 weeks of placebo treatment, 37 patients were treated with an antihypertensive combination drug containing triamterene. Adherence to therapy was assessed over 8 months by measuring urine fluorescence due to triamterene at intervals of 2-4 weeks, unknown to the patients. After 3 months of therapy, all patients, not just those with poor compliance, were given blood pressure devices and were carefully instructed in their use. The results showed that self-recording of blood pressure increased the compliance rate in the total group from 65% at the beginning of the study to 81% at the end. In those who initially showed poor compliance, there was an increase in compliance from 0 to 70% after self-measuring of blood pressure was introduced. We conclude that self-recording of blood pressure may be of value in patients with unsatisfactory blood pressure responses in whom poor compliance is suspected.

TI  - Improved follow-up care of hypertensive patients by a nurse practitioner in a rural clinic.
AB  - The usefulness of nurse practitioners in the care of hypertension has been demonstrated in a variety of settings. In a randomized prospective comparison between physicians and nurse practitioner care, observations are extended to rural ambulatory hypertensives. Data indicate that for patients who remain actively in follow-up, blood pressure control was the same when treated by either physicians or the nurse practitioner. However, patients treated by the nurse practitioner had a significantly better follow-up adherence rate than did those treated by physicians. The data presented support the use of nurse practitioners in the care of hypertension, particularly in rural populations where a need for intermediate level practitioners is likely to persist despite an expanding supply of physicians.

TI  - Experimental analysis of adherence counseling: implications for hypertension management.
AB  - A time series "reversal" design demonstrated that behavioral counseling increased medication adherence from about 60 to 100% for a black, hypertensive patient. However, inadequate pharmacological treatment yielded no clinically important blood pressure decrease. The combination of improved compliance and minimal blood pressure reduction led the patient's physician to explore higher doses and alternate medications to achieve blood pressure control. The physician's aggressive medical treatment was initiated only after the patient's compliance had been improved. Thus, this study suggests that paraprofessional counseling can increase compliance and illustrates the need for both behavioral and physiological data in clinical management to avoid blaming patients for poorly controlled blood pressure.

TI  - Enalapril versus triple-drug therapy in the treatment of renovascular hypertension.
AB  - 18 renovascular hypertensive patients were entered into a randomised, double-blind protocol to assess the safety and efficacy of enalapril (5 to 20 mg twice-daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 to 100 mg/day), versus triple-drug therapy employing hydrochlorothiazide (50 to 100 mg/day), timolol (10 to 30 mg twice-daily) and hydralazine (50 to 150 mg twice-daily). Specifically monitored were the effects of each drug regimen on blood pressure, plasma renin activity and angiotensin II, glomerular filtration rate by insulin clearance, and effective renal plasma flow by para-aminohippurate clearance. Results indicate that enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide was more effective than triple-drug therapy in lowering blood pressure. All patients on enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide had excellent control of blood pressure, and there were no adverse effects. In contrast, 50% of the patients on triple-drug therapy had either uncontrolled blood pressure or significant drug-related side effects. Patients who were uncontrolled or intolerant of triple-drug therapy were well controlled on enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide. Patients on enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide demonstrated stimulation of plasma renin activity with inhibition of plasma angiotensin II, indicating adherence with therapy. Therapy for both unilateral and bilateral renovascular hypertension with enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide did not result in reductions in either glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow, except in 1 patient with a functional solitary stenotic kidney. In contrast, triple-drug therapy was generally associated with modest reductions in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, with a severe reduction in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow occurring in 1 patient with bilateral symmetrical renovascular disease. We conclude that the combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide is a safer and more effective regimen, compared with triple-drug therapy, for the treatment of renovascular hypertension.

TI  - Evaluation of family health education to build social support for long-term control of high blood pressure.
AB  - Sustaining patient motivation for long-term adherence to drug therapies remains a substantial problem for physicians, other health care providers, the patients themselves, and their families. Other therapeutic requests such as dietary changes and weight control may be even more difficult to maintain than taking pills. As part of a controlled experimental design implemented in an outpatient teaching hospital, an educational program was implemented to improve family member support for medical compliance among hypertensive patients. Family members were interviewed, counseled, and provided with a booklet for the purpose of educating and involving them in the home management of high blood pressure. The booklet identified ways the family member could assist the patient with medication compliance, appointment keeping, as well as diet and weight control. These items were identified and recorded as behavioral objectives in the booklet. Patients were followed for three years to assess long-term outcomes. Results showed a strong statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups, with the experimental group demonstrating higher levels of appointment-keeping behavior, weight control, and BP under control (all p values less than .001). Analysis of the main effects of the educational program demonstrated that the family member support intervention accounted for the greatest decrease in diastolic blood pressure variability, R2 = .20, p less than .001.

TI  - [Does self-measurement of blood pressure improve compliance in hypertensive patients?]. [German]
AB  - To increase compliance in antihypertensive therapy, adherence was measured before and after distribution of non-automatic blood pressure devices. After 2 weeks of taking placebo, 37 essential hypertensive patients, both male and female, were treated over a period of 8 months with an antihypertensive combination drug containing triamterene. At each follow-up, compliance was checked by triamterene urine fluorescence. In the third month of therapy all patients were given a non-automatic blood pressure device. The results showed that self-recording of blood pressure increased the compliance rate of the group from 65% at the beginning of the trial to 81% at the end. Patients who showed poor adherence and consistently insufficient blood pressure values increased their compliance rate from 0% before to 70% after self-measuring of blood pressure. In the light of these findings, self-recording of blood pressure can be recommended in cases where compliance is suspected to be poor and blood pressure is inadequately controlled.

TI  - Responses of black and white males to the special intervention program of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial.
AB  - Of the 12,866 males aged 35 to 57 years who were randomly assigned to the special intervention (SI) and usual care (UC) groups of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), 931 (7.2%) were black. With use of a multivariate score from the Framingham study, all were assessed to be in the upper 10% to 15% of coronary risk because of their diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, and/or cigarette use. Blacks in the MRFIT were of lower educational and income levels and were less often employed in professional-technical-managerial or other white-collar jobs than whites. At baseline, blacks had higher mean blood pressures and a higher prevalence of hypertension than whites, were more often smokers but smoked fewer cigarettes per day, and had a higher prevalence of ECG abnormalities. Dietary lipid composition was similar for black and white males; so also were weight and body mass index, plasma total cholesterol levels, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were higher and triglyceride levels lower for blacks than whites. Attendance rates over the years of the trial were similarly high for blacks and whites. Among males in the SI group, smoking cessation rates, changes in dietary lipid composition and in plasma total and LDL cholesterol, and achievement of normotensive diastolic pressure with antihypertensive stepped-care treatment were comparable for black and white males. This MRFIT experience indicates ability to induce extensive changes in life-styles (eating and smoking habits) of both black and white American males of varying educational and socioeconomic backgrounds and also to achieve long-term effective adherence to programs for the treatment and control of hypertension.

TI  - The effects of lay counseling on medication adherence and blood pressure: adjunctive treatment for hypertension.
AB  - Ten noncompliant hypertensive patients were monitored and received counseling from trained aides. Monitoring and lay counseling was associated with a reduction of -10 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and of -7 mmHg in diastolic pressure (P less than 0.05). Medication adherence increased from 69% to 84%. Counseling resulted in pressure decreases equal to those obtained by usual care for similar but compliant patients. This analysis provides a model for paraprofessional adjunctive counseling of patients thought to be adhering poorly to their medication regimen, which may improve control of hypertension.

TI  - The combined use of MAOIs and tricyclics.
AB  - Combined MAOI-tricyclic treatment remains a plausible approach to depressions refractory to single drugs. Adherence to published guidelines should minimize special risks of the combined treatment. However, such risks do exist, and should be borne in mind. Most severe reactions - characterized by hyperthermia, delirium, convulsions, and sometimes fatal outcome - have occurred after a tricyclic was added to established MAOI treatment. Combined treatment may be associated with a lower risk of hypertensive crisis than treatment with MAOI alone. There are no data from double-blind, control-group studies to demonstrate an advantage for the MAOI-tricyclic combination in refractory depression. However, almost no such data exist to establish the advantage of any other treatment in this clinical situation. Clinical experience provides the primary basis for continued consideration of this approach when usual treatments have failed.

TI  - Screening, treatment and adherence to treatment for hypertension.
AB  - The population aged 40 to 64 years of the municipality of Koylio, situated in southwestern Finland, was screened for hypertension in 1973-74; a total of 1018 persons (92%) participated in the program. On the basis of two separate blood pressure measurements a total of 147 hypertensive individuals who were not under treatment were identified. These individuals were divided into two groups by randomization of matched pairs. One group (the control group) was merely advised by letter to see a physician for raised blood pressure, while the other group (the experimental group), in addition to being so notified, received written information explaining the nature of hypertension and the importance of its treatment. After two years, the individuals in both groups were invited for a follow-up blood-pressure measurement, with the object of investigating the number of individuals who had sought treatment and who had continued it, and the differences between the groups in treatment seeking and adherence. A total of 79% of those who were notified to seek medical care had done so. Antihypertensive drug therapy had been begun for 85% of these. After two years, 56% of those who had been found initially to be hypertensive and who were seen in the follow-up were still under treatment. In 43% of these the blood pressure was at the target level. No statistically significant differences in treatment seeking and adherence to it were found between the experimental and control groups, nor were differences found in the decline in the blood pressure or its target levels. Comparing with other studies shows, that results can be better if the health care system that carries out the screening procedure for hypertension also take active steps to bring the patient under treatment and keep him on the regimen.

TI  - A coordinating center in a clinical trial: the Hypertension Detection and Followup Program.
AB  - Multicenter clinical trials are often larger and more complex than other methods of clinical inquiry. They tend to involve a number of research or clinical centers and several formal committees. In many of these trials a coordinating center is one of the participating organizational units. This article describes one such coordinating center, that of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP). In 1971 the HDFP Coordinating Center was established to assist in planning and implementing this National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored, multicenter, community-based, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The HDFP Coordinating Center is a large, intricate organization comprised of personnel who perform a wide variety of functions. From 1972 to 1979 it supervised the adherence to a common protocol among the cooperating centers and reported the Program's progress to the various monitoring and review committees, the Steering Committee, and the NHLBI Program Office. The Program screened approximately 159,000 persons ages 30 to 69 years, identifying and following 10,940 hypertensive participants. It has been the responsibility of this Coordinating Center to institute, coordinate, and monitor the data-gathering activities of the study as a whole and to process, store, and analyze the large, multifaceted set of data that were collected.

TI  - Predicting treatment response to relaxation therapy for essential hypertension.
AB  - This study investigated the relationship of relaxation practice to blood pressure reduction in 31 hypertensive subjects who participated in an 8-week treatment program. Subjects achieved significant post-treatment reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which were maintained at 5 months follow-up and were found to generalize to the subjects' home environment. Subjects who practiced relaxation with their spouses showed significantly better treatment adherence than those who practiced relaxation alone. No differences were found in blood pressure reduction between the two groups, however, due to the fact that pressure reduction was only modestly correlated with degree of relaxation practice. A significant, inverse relationship was found between blood pressure reduction and two measures associated with the Type A behavior pattern. Results of this study provide further evidence that relaxation training is effective in the treatment of some persons with mild, essential hypertension; however, further efforts are needed to identify predictors of treatment response.

TI  - Psychosocial factors influence control of moderate and severe hypertension.
AB  - Factors affecting the degree of blood pressure control achieved by antihypertensive drug treatment in 150 patients with moderate and severe essential hypertension were analyzed. Patients were under continuing treatment for 1-23 years. Most patients were referred for hypertension which was difficult to control. All were managed by the senior author. They received multiple drug regimens and extensive efforts were made to encourage their adherence to the regimens. In spite of these efforts, 16 (11%) had poor blood pressure control. Satisfactory control was achieved in 52 (35%) patients and excellent control in 82 (55%) patients. As a group, their ideal body weight (IBW) was 125 +/- 22% (mean +/- SD) of normal. The mean number of antihypertensive tablets per day was significantly greater (P = 0.0009) in those with poor control as compared to those with satisfactory and excellent control. As % IBW increased, the number of antihypertensive tablets increased (P = 0.0021). We examined the relationship of blood pressure control with an index of compliance, with psychosocial factors (life events score, martial status) and with socioeconomic factors (work status, income). Poor blood pressure control was associated with a lower compliance index (P less than 0.0001) and a higher life events score (P less than 0.006). Poorly controlled patients were more likely to have poor health in general (P = 0.0002), to have kept fewer medical appointments during the preceding year (P less than 0.0001), to be unmarried (P less than 0.0001), to be unemployed (P less than 0.0028) and have a lower income (P less than 0.009). As % IBW increased, compliance index decreased, (P = 0.0045). Therefore, psychosocial and socioeconomic factors, as well as physical factors, influence blood pressure control in moderate and severe essential hypertension.

TI  - Improving compliance among hypertensives: a triage criterion with cost-benefit implications.
AB  - Triage method based upon individual patient characteristics is developed to determine the most effective health education interventions for hypertensive patients. The sample included 402 patients randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The efficacy of a triage process, whereby patients are subdivided into groups that are more predisposed to benefit from a given health education approach, is discussed. From a limited cost-benefit evaluation, it appears that the benefits of the triage method for achieving medication compliance clearly outweigh its costs only in the case of the highly depressed patients (24 per cent of the sample). Different levels of depression were found to be differentially responsive to different health education treatments for achieving adherence to medication. The most depressed patients were more responsive to family member reinforcement, a 156 per cent increase in the number of high compliers as compared to no intervention.

TI  - Clinical program for screening and treatment of hypertension in veterans.
AB  - Hypertension clinics, in which primary care is provided by specially trained nonphysician therapists under physician supervision, can provide very effective and relatively inexpensive control of hypertension for large numbers of patients. Since 1972, 32 VA Hypertension Screening and Treatment Clinics have screened about 500,000 veterans, 29 percent of whom have had diastolic pressures of 90 mmHg or more and 13 percent of whom have had diastolic pressures of 105 mmHg or more. Of subjects who returned for a second visit, 77 percent continued to have diastolic pressures of 90 mmHg or more. Blacks had a higher percentage of severe hypertension than whites.Since treatment became available in these clinics in 1974, 25,000 veterans have been treated. Computerized data are available for 10,777 of them who began treatment during 1974, 1975, or 1976. Of those with at least five treatment visits during that period, half had diastolic pressures below 90 mmHg at their most recent visit, and 80 percent had diastolic pressures below 100 mmHg. Moreover visit adherence was high, with two thirds of those who began treatment in these clinics during their first six months of operation continuing that treatment for two and a half years.

TI  - Two techniques to improve adherence to dietary sodium restriction in the treatment of hypertension.
AB  - To improve adherence to dietary sodium restriction, we validated two simple techniques for providing rapid and accurate estimated of urinary content-overnight urine collections and an immediate analysis of urine sodium content. These techniques were then applied in a trial with a group of patients with hypertension who were considered to be resistant to the adoption of dietary changes. After six months, 68% of the patients on the lower-sodium diet reduced their urine sodium content by one third or more. They had an 11-mm Hg fall in mean BP compared with a 3-mm Hg rise in the control group, who were not on a lower-sodium diet, and a lesser fall in plasma potassium levels.

TI  - Correlates of attendance and compliance in the hypertension detection and follow-up program.
AB  - The Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program (HDFP) screened 159,000 individuals aged 30-69 years in 14 communities. Using a two-stage process, 10,940 hypertensives were randomized into two treatment groups. The first group was referred to community sources for care (RC), and the second received free Stepped Care (SC) treatment with extensive efforts to reduce the barriers to care. One year after enrollment, attendance showed 85% of SC participants active (white males 88%, white females 84%, black males 83%, and black females 84%). One year attendance rates ranged from a low of 84% for those with baseline DBP 90-104 mm Hg to a high of 90% for those with baseline DBP greater than or equal to 115 mm Hg. There was no apparent association with age, however, attendance exhibited a positive relationship with education, ranging from 83% for those completing less than high school to 94% for those with degrees beyond college. Life tables analyses demonstrated that race, sex, and blood pressure level compliance differences manifest themselves at the early stages of enrollment with little variation among participants once in the program. Pill counts correlated with percent with controlled blood pressure as well as serum potassium and calcium levels. Educational level was also a major predictor of drug adherence ranging from 74.7% to 89.7% (from under 7th grade to above college) having taken greater than or equal to 80% of their pills.

TI  - The experimental evidence for weight-loss treatment of essential hypertension: a critical review. [Review] [116 refs]
AB  - The empirical evidence concerning the therapeutic effects of weight loss for hypertension treatment was reviewed. Interventions were critically reviewed for strength of measures and experimental design. Six of 21 intervention studies proved to be methodologically strong. However, only one study was considered a randomized clinical trial, testing the combined effects of weight reduction and pharmacological treatment of hypertension. Average blood pressure decrease obtained from the methodologically strongest studies was -21 mmHg and -13 mmHg, for systolic and diastolic measures, respectively. This magnitude change suggests that weight loss may be a clinically and statistically significant treatment. Confounding and bias variables, such as adherence to diet, medication, salt consumption, etc., were discussed and future areas of research were outlined. It was concluded that weight loss appears to be an effective and safe treatment of hypertension. [References: 116]

TI  - A test of interventions to increase adherence to hypertensive medical regimens.
AB  - Low rates of adherence to hypertensive therapy limit patients' securing the full benefits of treatment. While some factors related to adherence have been identified research on the effectiveness of interventions to increase adherence levels is sparse. The present study was designed to assess the impact of a series of different interventions on a group of some 400 patients, all under the care of private physicians in a small community. A factorial design was employed to deliver four, sequential educational interventions, about four months apart, to randomly selected sub-groups. Interviews before and after each intervention provided information concerning self-reported adherence, health status, health beliefs, and personal characteristics. Pertinent medical records and pharmacy data were also obtained. The first intervention - printed material - did not significantly affect adherence. The second and fourth interventions - nurse telephone calls and social support - each increased medication taking and the third intervention - self-monitoring - led to better weight control. There was no cumulative impact of the interventions and different aspects of regimens were not significantly related to one another.

TI  - [Compliance in hypertensive patients and patients with cardiac insufficiency]. [German]
AB  - In the present study the compliance or drug-adherence of 83 patients with hypertension (n = 66), heart failure (n = 14) or edema of non-cardiac origin (n = 3) was investigated by the urine fluorescence method over an observation period of 17.8 +/- 15.1 weeks. Mean compliance rate of all patients was 79.7%. Individual drug-adherence ranged from 0 to 100%. Half of the patients (54.2%; n = 45) had positive urine samples in all investigations performed. A quarter (25.3%; n = 21) were compliant in over 50%, whereas in 14.5% (n = 12) the drug could be detected in the urine in only 10 to 50% of the tests and in 6% (n = 5) in less than 10%. The 17 symptomatic patients (patients with heart failure and/or edemas) showed a slightly better compliance (87.0%) than patients with hypertension, who had positive urine samples in 77.3 +/- 30.1% of tests. However, the difference observed was not statistically significant. During treatment a decrease in compliance from 82% at the first visit to 73% and 75% respectively at the second and third could be observed. Finally, at the fourth and fifth consultation only 62.2% and 56% respectively of the patients had positive urine samples. Our results show a good compliance rate in our patients as compared to American studies. During treatment a continuous decrease in compliance could be observed. Our results indicate that the duration of treatment seems to be an important determinant for the patient's drug-adherence. Therefore, it appears necessary to perform compliance-improving strategies as early as after the first follow-up visits.

TI  - Reasons for dropout from exercise programs in post-coronary patients.
AB  - The dropout rate in the 7-yr Ontario Exercise Heart Collaborative Study of post-coronary men engaged in exercise programs was examined in order to determine possible contributing factors. A questionnaire pertaining to psychosocial and program-related variables was distributed to 728 subjects who were previously assigned randomly on the basis of four prognostic risk factors (occupation, personality, hypertension, and angina) into exercise groups: low intensity exercise (LIE), and high intensity exercise (HIE). Comparisons of answers by the 639 respondents (266 dropouts; 373 compliers) were made initially by chi-square analysis to determine significant categories of questions and, subsequently, by a logistic transform to determine the specific questions which related significantly to the dropout rate. It was found that three main categories were associated with a high dropout rate: convenience aspects of the exercise center, perceptions of the exercise program, and family/lifestyle factors. These three main categories should be carefully considered when designing and implementing potential compliance-improving strategies for secondary prevention exercise programs entailing long-term adherence.

TI  - A company-instituted program to improve blood pressure control in primary care.
AB  - An occupation-based effort to improve the outcome of antihypertensive therapy provided in the community was instituted by the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1977. The goal of the program was to utilize the administrative and organizational resources of the company to enhance employee/patient adherence to treatment provided in conventional primary care settings. Key elements of the program were: companywide education and on-site screening, referral to community physicians and company assumption of all patient costs, linked to a monitoring system to permit oversight of care. Initially, 98% of employees were screened, 70% accepted referral for care and 59% fully adhered to program performance criteria. Blood pressure control has risen from 36% at the beginning to 69% at the end of the second year. Fully compliant patients have achieved the greatest lowering of blood pressure and compiled the best work attendance record. Program costs are modest and acceptance by employees and physicians supports the concept that occupation-based, systematic efforts can enhance the impact of primary care.

TI  - Influencing adherence among hypertensives.
AB  - In the treatment of hypertension, problems of nonadherence and consequent poor blood pressure control are particularly severe. Alternative intervention strategies were compared to explore means of improving adherence and lowering blood pressures. In a 3 x 4 repeated measures analysis of variance design, 115 patients were randomly selected and randomly assigned to one of three treatment modalities (routine clinic care, patient education, and contingency contracting) and were followed over four clinic visits. Subjects' knowledge about hypertension and its management, adherence to requests for regular medical follow-up, and blood pressure levels were measured. Patient education was not effective in lowering blood pressures; it produced an untoward outcome, a dropout rate higher than that for patients receiving only routine clinic care. However, contingency contracting was an effective intervention strategy for improving patient knowledge, F (1,59) = 51.32, p less than .0001; adherence to requests for regular medical care, Max L (2) = 25.9, p less than .0001; and decreasing diastolic blood pressures, F (2,49) = 3.39, p less than .05.

TI  - Initial knowledge and attitudes as predictors of intervention effects: the individual management plan.
AB  - This paper addresses questions concerning the effects of patient education strategies to increase adherence to antihypertensive medical regimens. It endeavors to fill gaps in our knowledge about intervention effects that may link research findings with health care applications. Data from a community intervention study of 432 hypertensives are used to address two broad questions relating research on patient education to health care practice: Do interventions have different effects on individuals who differ with respect to initial attitudes or knowledge, and to what extent do interventions produce changes in the factors thought to mediate their effects on behavior? This investigation tests a client-oriented approach to the delivery of interventions, the Individual Management Plan (IMP). The IMP approach is based on the hypothesis that interventions will be differentially effective for individuals with varying levels of initial attitudes and knowledge thought to mediate the effects of the interventions on behavior. Analysis of variance, correlational analyses, and analysis of covariance models are used to test various aspects of this hypothesis. Analyses are performed for adherence to medication regimens, dietary sodium restrictions, and weight-loss recommendations. The results of analyses offer only minimal support for the IMP hypothesis. The state of the art and constraining factors in the study are examined to guide future applications of the IMP approach.

TI  - Linking research and practice in patient education for hypertension: patient responses to four educational interventions.
AB  - Data from a longitudinal study of 432 hypertensive patients under the care of private practitioners are used to answer two questions: How do patients react to educational interventions, and how are their responses related to changes in their adherence behaviors? The four educational interventions, introduced sequentially and tested in a factorial design, were written messages, nurse's phone call, self-monitoring and social support. Patients' reactions to the interventions were assessed, using data from questions asked at post-intervention interviews and information recorded during the interventions. Cognitive, attitudinal and behavioral data are examined. Findings indicate that respondents were cognizant of the interventions and viewed them positively; also, some predictions about intervention features were supported. However, actions which respondents attributed to the interventions were not found to be related to increased adherence, according to the test used in this study.

TI  - Aspirin in coronary heart disease. The Coronary Drug Project Research Group.
AB  - The Coronary Drug Project Aspirin Study (CDPA), started in late 1972 and terminated in early 1974, involved men selected from three groups originally receiving dextrothyroxine or estrogen therapy in the Coronary Drug Project. All patients had a history of myocardial infarction, most of them several years earlier. Length of follow-up ranged from 10-28 months (average 22 months). A total of 1529 patients were recruited and were randomly assigned on a double-blind basis to aspirin therapy -- one 324-mg tablet three times daily or a corresponding placebo treatment. Data indicate a high level of adherence to the study protocol. No major differences were recorded in use of nonstudy medications in the two treatment groups. Overall mortality was 5.8% in the aspirin group and 8.3% in the placebo group (an observed difference of 30%). This difference, suggestive of a beneficial effect for aspirin in the treatment of post-myocardial infarction men, was not large enough to be conclusive.

TI  - Patient behavior for blood pressure control. Guidelines for professionals.
AB  - Behaviors critical to hypertensive patients' achieving therapeutic control and assuming active responsibility for their own care were defined by an interdisciplinary group brought together by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. The report focused on the achievement and maintenance of long-term control through drug therapy and concentrated on the patient-physician interaction as a critical factor. The basic hypothesis that active participation by the patient favors successful management of hypertension identifies the physician, the prime diagnostician and initiator of the subsequent interaction, as a promotor of that important collaboration. The working group views the patient as the decision-maker and problemsolver, with the professional functioning as advisor and guide. This synthesis of available theory and practice in therapy adherence includes knowledge, attitudes, and skills defined under four major behaviors: making the decision for control, taking medication, monitoring progress, and problem solving.

TI  - A hypertension control program based on the workplace. Report on the Chicago Center.
AB  - In several large Chicago companies and institutions, workplace screening of 7,151 persons yielded 833 suspect hypertensives. Of these, 91% attended a follow-up verification visit, where for 513 persons high diastolic pressure was confirmed. One-half of these persons were referred to their physicians for treatment and one-half were randomly assigned to be treated directly by HDFP, in a step-wise pharmacologic regimen to normalize diastolic pressure. Of the 257 persons assigned to program treatment, 94% accepted such treatment, and over 90% of these still living in the community were active participants at one year. Average diastolic pressure of these active participants was 83.1 mm Hg at one year, compared to 102.6 at first screen and 98.8 at the second confirmatory screening. A strenuous effort has been made to reduce or eliminate obstacles to treatment, including lack of understanding of the need for long-term therapy, cost barriers and barriers of inconvenience of treatment. The medical team conducting the program combined physicians with nonphysician therapist-health counselors, plus "outreach" staff, to maximize program adherence. Preliminary experiences in the Chicago Center of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program (HDFP) give encouraging evidence that the workplace is a useful base for successful hypertension control efforts.

TI  - Patient participation in a hypertension control program. Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program Cooperative Group.
AB  - In the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, the largest standardized hypertension detection, follow-up, and treatment program to date in the United States, participation rates have been high at all stages. More than 75% of those with suspected hypertension at screening attended follow-up rescreening, and more than 80% of the 5,314 hypertensive patients assigned to program treatment remained active at the end of one year. Differences in participation rates were generally small. To accomplish this, intensive efforts were required to maximize attendance, and the program was shaped to reduce known barriers to initial attendance and long-term adherence. Against the background of a high overall program response rate for all sex-race groups, factors that might be associated with variations in response were examined: age, socioeconomic characteristics, health status, and appointment schedule.

TI  - Hypertension treated by salt restriction.
AB  - 31 patients with a diastolic blood-pressure between 95 and 109 mm Hg have been treated for two years with a regimen involving a moderate restriction of salt in the diet. The results are compared with those in a control group and in a drug-treated group. Salt restriction has reduced the diastolic blood-pressure by 7.3+/-1.6 mm Hg, a result similar to that in patients treated with antihypertensive drugs. In the untreated group the diastolic blood-pressure rose by 1.8+/-1.1 mm Hg. Most patients did not achieve the desired amount of salt restriction and a stricter adherence to the diet might have caused further falls in blood-pressure. Excessive salt intake is probably a major cause of the epidemic of hypertension in "civilised" countries and a reduction in salt intake may help to control the epidemic. In persons with a diastolic blood-pressure between 90 and 105 mm Hg salt restriction should be tried before drugs.

TI  - The rate of initiation of treatment for hypertension in a community, 1971--1975.
AB  - In 1971 persons aged 50-59 in a community were screened for hypertension and those with diastolic BP greater than or equal to 110 mmHg were notified. On reviewing the sample in 1975 the treatment rate had doubled to 22%. Screening in 1971 was followed by an immediate rise in numbers starting treatment, most being notified cases. Thereafter initiation of treatment at a rate of 3-8 cases per 100 persons per year chiefly reflected identification of subjects deemed to need treatment in the ordinary course of medical practice. Of those starting treatment during the four years 25% had stopped it by 1975. The influence of screening and other factors on the rate of initiation of treatment and adherence to it are discussed. With an already high attendance rate at doctors, regular screening of this whole age group seems feasible within the framework of general practice. The high treatment rate found in 1975 underlines the urgent need for the indications currently used for starting treatment to be validated.

Provision was made by means of a prescreening survey to determine demographic and attitudinal characteristics in the group invited to screening before the invitation was extended, thus providing information on non-participants as well as participants. Men who satisfied the criteria for borderline levels of one or more of the three risk factors on at least two of possible three occasions were invited to participate in a radomized multifactor treatment trial either being treated by medication for the appropriate risk factor [or factors], or observed during the same intervals in the same fashion as those treated. During follow-up attempts were made to measure adherence to the prescribed medication.

TI  - Observations following Corynebacterium parvum administration to patients with advanced malignancy. a phase I study.
AB  - There has been increasing interest regarding the use of Corynebacterium parvum (CP) with other modalities in the management of primary cancer. Due to the paucity of specific information available relative to CP toxicity, a Phase I study was carried out in patients with advanced disease. The purpose of the investigation was not to evaluate the effect of CP on tumor growth. from 273 injections of CP in 40 patients it was observed that following intravenous (i.v.) infusion of CP: a) a febrile response and chills of considerable severity occured in almost all patients and did not appreciably diminish in intensity following repetitive administrations; b) nausea, vomiting, headache, and confusion were not infrequent; c) a "flu-like" syndrome lasting 24 to 48 hours occurred following almost all courses of CP; d) blood pressure elevations occurred on occasion and were related to the severity of other-side-effects; hyper- or hypo- tension was not a problem; e) ther were no anaphalactic reactions. Pretreatment with a single administration of 100 mg of hydrocortisone prior to CP infusion markedly and in some instances dramatically diminished the toxicity and made acceptable the use of i.v. CP on an outpatient basis. The use of i.v. CP in patients with cerebral metasteses may be hazardous. Subcutaneously administered CP resulted in a significant number of undesirable local reactions. Evaluation of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity response, immunoglobulins, complement, and E- and EAC-rosette-forming cells during CP administration failed to demonstrate significant change from injection values. Results were similar whether hydrocortisone pretreatment was or was not employed. From the standpoint of toxicity it now seems appropriate to use i.v. CP, particularly following pretreatment with hydrocortisone, in a controlled clinical trial to evaluate its therapeutic effectiveness in the management of primary cancer.

TI  - Adherence and blood-pressure response to hypertension treatment.
AB  - 2 years of experience in the first phase of a large cooperative national hypertension programme yielded data indicating that a good level of patient adherence can be achieved and that satisfactory blood-pressure control can be maintained long term. For 116 participants, all employed persons, dropout in the first year was 20% but only 3% dropped out in the second year. At the second annual examination, 82% of those still in the programme had diastolic pressures under 90 mm Hg, with an average reduction of 18 mm Hg. Thus, nearly two-thirds (64%) of all patients originally enrolled were both active and with normal levels of blood-pressure after two years. Only 18% of active programme-treated patients had diastolic pressure 90 mm Hg or higher at the second anniversary in contrast with 33% of patients referred to their own doctors. In programme-treated patients, standard medication was used; diuretics effectively lowered blood-pressure in a third of patients, and diuretics plus reserpine were effective for another 20%. Special features of the programme included assistance to physicians by health counsellor therapists. Methods for achieving a high adherence-rate and satisfactory blood-pressure control probably have wider applicability.
