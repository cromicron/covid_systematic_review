      "AB  - We examined associations between dietary quality indices and breast cancer risk by molecular subtype among 100,643 women in the prospective Nurses' Health Study (NHS) cohort, followed from 1984 to 2006. Dietary quality scores for the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), alternate Mediterranean diet (aMED), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary patterns were calculated from semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires collected every 2-4 years. Breast cancer molecular subtypes were defined according to estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), and epidermal growth factor receptor status from immunostained tumor microarrays in combination with histologic grade. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age and breast cancer risk factors, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Competing risk analyses were used to assess heterogeneity by subtype. We did not observe any significant associations between the AHEI or aMED dietary patterns and risk of breast cancer by molecular subtype. However, a significantly reduced risk of HER2-type breast cancer was observed among women in 5th versus 1st quintile of the DASH dietary pattern [n = 134 cases, Q5 vs. Q1 HR (95 % CI) = 0.44 (0.25-0.77)], and the inverse trend across quintiles was significant (p trend = 0.02). We did not observe any heterogeneity in associations between AHEI (p het = 0.25), aMED (p het = 0.71), and DASH (p het = 0.12) dietary patterns and breast cancer by subtype. Adherence to the AHEI, aMED, and DASH dietary patterns was not strongly associated with breast cancer molecular subtypes.\n",

      "AB  - Self-management support tools using technology may improve adherence to hypertension treatment. There is a need for user-friendly tools facilitating patients' understanding of the interconnections between blood pressure, wellbeing and lifestyle. This study aimed to examine comprehension, comprehensiveness and relevance of items, and further to evaluate the usability and reliability of an interactive hypertension-specific mobile phone self-report system. Areas important in supporting self-management and candidate items were derived from five focus group interviews with patients and healthcare professionals (n = 27), supplemented by a literature review. Items and response formats were drafted to meet specifications for mobile phone administration and were integrated into a mobile phone data-capture system. Content validity and usability were assessed iteratively in four rounds of cognitive interviews with patients (n = 21) and healthcare professionals (n = 4). Reliability was examined using a test-retest. Focus group analyses yielded six areas covered by 16 items. The cognitive interviews showed satisfactory item comprehension, relevance and coverage; however, one item was added. The mobile phone self-report system was reliable and perceived easy to use. The mobile phone self-report system appears efficiently to capture information relevant in patients' self-management of hypertension. Future studies need to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in improving self-management of hypertension in clinical practice.\n",

      "AB  - BACKGROUND: Protocol deviations before and after tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment for ischemic stroke are common. It is unclear if patient or hospital factors predict protocol deviations. We examined predictors of protocol deviations and the effects of protocol violations on symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH).\n",
      "AB  - METHODS: We used data from the Increasing Stroke Treatment through Interventional Behavior Change Tactics trial, a cluster-randomized, controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a barrier assessment and educational intervention to increase appropriate tPA use in 24 Michigan community hospitals, to review tPA treatments between 2007 and 2010. Protocol violations were defined as deviations from the standard tPA protocol, both before and after treatment. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to determine if patient and hospital variables were associated with pretreatment or post-treatment protocol deviations.\n",
      "AB  - RESULTS: During the study, 557 patients (mean age 70, 52% male, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 12) were treated with tPA. Protocol deviations occurred in 233 (42%) patients: 16% had pretreatment deviations, 35% had post-treatment deviations, and 9% had both. The most common protocol deviations included elevated post-treatment blood pressure, antithrombotic agent use within 24 hours of treatment, and elevated pretreatment blood pressure. Protocol deviations were not associated with sICH, stroke severity, or hospital factors. Older age was associated with pretreatment protocol deviations (adjusted odds ratio [OR], .52; 95% confidence interval [CI], .30-.92). Pretreatment deviations were associated with post-treatment deviations (adjusted OR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.91-5.35).\n",

      "AB  - RESULTS: Partly consistent with our four hypotheses, the following results were found: (a) Black American, younger, never married, and poorer patients had lower medication treatment adherence (b) depression was significantly associated with lower self-reported medication adherence; (c) insecure-dismissing attachment style was related to lower medication adherence; and (d) insecure-dismissing attachment style mediates the relation between depression and medication treatment adherence by exacerbating the negative association.\n",

      "{'format': 'pubmed', 'title': 'Depression, patient characteristics, and attachment style: correlates and mediators of medication treatment adherence in a racially diverse primary care sample.', 'rct_ptyp': True, 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: The depth and breadth of problems related to depressive symptomatology and optimal treatment outcomes, including medication treatment adherence, have long been documented in the literature. Missing are clear explanations as to what factors and patient characteristics may account for lack of medication treatment adherence. OBJECTIVES: The two objectives of the current study were to examine the predictive strength of depression, patient characteristics, and patient attachment style regarding medication treatment adherence and to consider the extent to which attachment styles mediate the relation between depression and medication treatment adherence. METHOD: Participants in the present study were 237 racially diverse American primary care patients with a diagnosis of hypertension who were participants in a clinical trial. Depression, patient characteristics, attachment style, and medication treatment adherence were assessed. RESULTS: Partly consistent with our four hypotheses, the following results were found: (a) Black American, younger, never married, and poorer patients had lower medication treatment adherence (b) depression was significantly associated with lower self-reported medication adherence; (c) insecure-dismissing attachment style was related to lower medication adherence; and (d) insecure-dismissing attachment style mediates the relation between depression and medication treatment adherence by exacerbating the negative association. CONCLUSION: Physicians and other primary care providers should consider how depressive symptomatology, patient characteristics, and attachment style may inform the treatment plans they put forward and the extent to which patients may adhere to those treatment plans.'}\n"
